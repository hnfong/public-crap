So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Grammar and Agreement Issues:

1. "story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying..." - The use of "saying" instead of "says" is incorrect here. It should be singular to agree with the singular noun "story."

2 "that he's probably onto something..." - The use of "he's" assumes a male gender, which may not be accurate or inclusive. Consider a more gender-neutral phrase, such as "they're."

3. "...I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea..." - This sentence is in the past tense, but the context suggests that the event happened in the past from the perspective of the past tense narrative, so it should be in the past perfect: "I had briefly wondered..."

4. "...this kind of predatory capitalist attitude..." - The use of "attitude" here is incorrect; a better word choice would be "mentality" or "approach."

5. "...but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - This sentence is an independent clause and should be capitalized: "But ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid."

6. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)..." - The use of "regulatory" as an adjective to modify "risk" is awkward and unclear. Consider rephrasing for clarity.

7. "...In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." - This phrase contains a verb tense agreement issue; "they're" should be in the singular form to agree with "America."

8. "...before the companies crash and burn..." - This phrase is overly dramatic and should be replaced with a more formal expression to maintain the tone of the text, such as "before they become obsolete."

9. "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." - The verb "know" should be used instead of "knows" to agree with the plural subject "those." The word "phrase" is also incorrect in this context and should be replaced with "phase."

10. "...but I always knew we're in a state of flux." - The verb tense is incorrect here; it should be "I always knew we were in a state of flux."


Stylistic and Other Problems:

1. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - This phrase is quite blunt and could be rephrased to be less offensive, especially given the acknowledgment that tech workers are diligent and hardworking.

2. "...this kind of predatory capitalist attitude..." - The term "predatory capitalist" is loaded and may not accurately represent the situation. It could be replaced with a more neutral phrase, such as "short-sighted profit-driven approach."

3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..." - This phrase is awkward and wordy. Consider simplifying: "My analysis at the time followed a similar line of logic..."

4. "...but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - This sentence dismisses potential ethical concerns too lightly, especially given the acknowledgment of the negative impact of predatory capitalism earlier in the text.

5. "...but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - This phrase is flippant and may be inappropriate for a serious discussion of the potential regulatory risks facing tech companies.

6. "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough..." - This sentence raises a significant concern but is buried within a parenthetical remark, minimizing its importance. It should be given more emphasis and expanded upon to explain the concern in more detail.

7. "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift" - The use of all caps and exclamation mark for emphasis is unnecessary and should be avoided in formal writing.

8. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make..." - This phrase is casual and should be rephrased to maintain a consistent tone with the rest of the text.

9. "...but I always knew we're in a state of flux." - This sentence contradicts the earlier statement that people in more mature industries have reasonable expectations for their careers. It should be clarified or expanded upon to explain this discrepancy.

10. "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity..." - The use of "FI" without explanation or definition may be confusing for some readers. It should be written out or defined to ensure clarity.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
