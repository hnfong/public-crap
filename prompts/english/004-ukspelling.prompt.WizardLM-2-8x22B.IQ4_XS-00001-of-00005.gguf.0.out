 Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a little girl named Lily. Lily loved rainbows more than anything in the world. She would spend hours gazing at the sky, waiting for the rain to stop and the sun to peek out from behind the clouds.

One day, after a particularly heavy downpour, Lily spotted the most magnificent rainbow she had ever seen. It arched across the sky like a colourful bridge, its ends seemingly tucked away behind the village church and the old oak tree in the meadow. The colours were so vivid that they seemed to dance before her eyes â€“ red as the roses in her grandmother's garden, orange as the marigolds that lined the village paths, yellow as the daffodils that bloomed in spring, green as the lush grass in the fields, blue as the forget-me-nots by the babbling brook, indigo like the twilight sky, and violet as the lavender in the cottage gardens.

Lily raced outside, her heart fluttering with excitement. She twirled around, her laughter mingling with the sound of the retreating rain. The rainbow seemed to smile down at her, a magical gift from the sky.

As she watched, a gentle breeze lifted the rainbow's colours, swirling them into a kaleidoscope of shimmering light. Lily reached out her hand, half-expecting to feel the silky touch of the rainbow's edge. To her amazement, a tiny droplet landed on her palm, glistening with all the colours of the rainbow.

"Thank you," Lily whispered to the sky, her eyes wide with wonder. She knew that this rainbow was her favourite because it had shared its magic with her, and from that day on, whenever the rain stopped and the sun came out, Lily would remember the day the rainbow came to life. [end of text]
