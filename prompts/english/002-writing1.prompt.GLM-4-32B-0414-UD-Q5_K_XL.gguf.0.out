The little girl, Clara, sat on her bed, staring at the fluffy pillow piled high with her favorite stuffed animals. She poked the pillow, watching it slowly deflate, then puff back up. It felt soft and comforting, but lately, she felt a bit empty inside. Her parents were busy, her friends were playing elsewhere, and the pillow, no matter how soft, couldn't fill the space.

She looked out the window. A big, puffy cloud drifted lazily across the sky. It looked like a giant, soft sheep, or maybe a sleeping whale. She wished she could reach out and touch it, feel its imagined softness. But it was just a cloud, far away, and her loneliness felt very close.

"Being lonely is the worst thing ever!" she whispered to the pillow, feeling a little silly. "It's like having a hole right here," she patted her chest, "that nothing can fill."

Her mother walked in, carrying a tray with a cup of tea and a small plate of cookies. "What's wrong, sweetie?" she asked, her voice gentle.

Clara looked up, tears welling in her eyes. "I'm so lonely, Mommy," she sniffled. "It feels like I'm all alone in the whole world. I was just looking at the cloud outside, and thinking how far away everything is, and..." She trailed off, feeling like she was exaggerating, making a big deal out of nothing.

Her mother sat down on the edge of the bed, pulling Clara close. She didn't say, "It's not that bad," or "Stop being silly." Instead, she just held her, her arms warm and strong. Clara buried her face against her mother's shoulder, the scent of her familiar perfume calming her.

"You're not alone, Clara," her mother murmured, stroking her hair. "You have me, and your dad, and your grandparents, and your friends. We're all connected, even when we're not right here."

Clara felt the tightness in her chest loosen. Her mother's hug was like the pillow, but infinitely better. It was warm, it was real, and it was filled with something the pillow couldn't offer â€“ love. She looked up at her mother's kind eyes, then back at the pillow piled on her bed. The pillow was still soft, but now, Clara understood. The pillow could comfort her physically, but it was the love surrounding her, the connections she shared, that truly filled the emptiness. The cloud outside was still far away, but the love inside her home was right there, waiting, always. [end of text]
