The text you've provided appears to be a commentary or observation about the gameplay mechanics of the Mario franchise, specifically focusing on the concept of inertia and its impact on the player's control of Mario. Let's break it down line by line:

1. **"inertia of running"**: This line refers to the physical principle of inertia, which in the context of video games, means that once Mario starts running, he continues to move forward with a certain momentum unless acted upon by an external force (like friction, a jump, or a collision). This is a common mechanic in many platformers, including the Mario series.

2. **"makes Mario slip"**: This suggests that the inertia of Mario's movement can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, such as slipping. In the Mario games, there are various surfaces and obstacles that can cause Mario to lose traction or slip, especially when he's moving at high speeds. This can be particularly challenging for players who are not used to the game's physics.

3. **"into the abyss"**: This line implies that the slipping caused by Mario's inertia can have severe consequences, such as falling into a bottomless pit or abyss. In many Mario levels, there are deep drops or pits that can result in a game over if Mario falls into them. The mention of an "abyss" adds a dramatic flair to the commentary, emphasizing the potential danger of Mario's momentum.

4. **"skill issue"**: This final line suggests that the problem of Mario slipping into the abyss due to his inertia is primarily a matter of player skill. It implies that experienced players can control Mario's movements more precisely and avoid such pitfalls, while less skilled players might struggle with the game's mechanics. This could be interpreted as a criticism of the game's difficulty or as an acknowledgment of the skill ceiling in the Mario franchise.

Overall, the text is a concise observation about the challenges of controlling Mario in the Mario games, highlighting the role of inertia in creating both the excitement and the frustration of gameplay. It also touches on the skill level required to master these mechanics, suggesting that the game's difficulty is not just a matter of game design but also of player proficiency. [end of text]
