1. You would have to count to **one thousand** before you encounter the letter “A” in the English spelling of a whole number.  
   - All numbers from one to nine hundred ninety-nine are spelled without an “A”:  
     one, two, three, ..., ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred one, ..., nine hundred ninety-nine.  
   - The first number containing the letter “A” is **one thousand**.

2. The full sentence is:  
   **“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”**  
   This sentence is famous because it is a **pangram** — a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It has been widely used for typing practice, font displays, and testing typewriters and keyboards since at least the late 19th century.

3. **The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**

One crisp autumn afternoon, the Third Little Pig — the clever one who built his house of brick — was tending his garden when he heard a rustling in the woods. Out stumbled Little Red Riding Hood, basket in hand, her red hood askew.

“Good day, sir!” she called. “I’m on my way to Granny’s, but the wolf... he’s been lurking near the path. I think he’s learned to speak!”

The brick pig chuckled. “Speak? That wolf’s been trying to bluff his way into houses since last spring. He tried my brick house last Tuesday. Said he was a door-to-door salesman of ‘wolf-sized’ rugs.”

Red Riding Hood giggled. “He tried to trick me too! Said he’d help me carry my basket if I told him where Granny lived.”

The brick pig nodded. “Well, I’ve got a solution. Come with me.”

He led her to his sturdy brick house, where he’d installed a clever trapdoor and a loud bell tied to the front gate. “If the wolf comes,” he said, “he’ll ring the bell, and we’ll be ready.”

Just then, a shadow moved in the trees. The wolf, in a fake mustache and a “delivery” vest, knocked on the door.

“Delivery for Granny!” he called.

The brick pig winked at Red Riding Hood. She rang the bell.

*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*

Out poured the three pigs’ neighbors — a wise old owl, a troop of beavers, and even the Big Bad Wolf’s old nemesis: Granny, who had been hiding in the cellar all along, knitting a wolf-proof sweater.

The wolf, startled, tripped over his own mustache and rolled into a bush.

“Looks like you’ve been outsmarted again,” Granny said, handing him a plate of cookies. “Next time, try being a baker instead of a wolf.”

The wolf sighed. “I just wanted a snack... and maybe a nap.”

And so, the wolf stayed for tea. He even helped rebuild the third pig’s garden fence — and never tried to eat anyone again.
