### Grammar Issues

1. **Tense Consistency**: 
   - "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" should maintain past tense consistency with the rest of the narrative. Consider "I couldn't help but agree that he was probably onto something."

2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:
   - "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs" should be "I had no doubt that they could cut costs" to maintain past tense consistency.

3. **Pronoun Agreement**:
   - "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know."

4. **Verb Tense**:
   - "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder" should be "I mean, people who knew approximately how much I made by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might have wondered" for past tense consistency.

5. **Conditional Structure**:
   - "If only because I would have hated how I participated" should be "If only because I would have hated having participated" for clarity and grammatical correctness.

### Stylistic Issues

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**:
   - The phrase "Andreessen Horowitz basically saying" is informal and could be clearer. Consider "Andreessen Horowitz has been saying."

2. **Tone Consistency**:
   - The tone shifts between casual and analytical. For a more cohesive style, choose one tone and maintain it throughout.

3. **Redundancy**:
   - "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" is redundant. Consider "I'm sure are diligent and hardworking."

4. **Jargon and Informality**:
   - Phrases like "enough to not kill their golden goose" and "In America We Trust" are informal and could be rephrased for a more formal tone.

5. **Ambiguity**:
   - "The ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" is vague. Specify what "financial efficiency" entails.

### Other Issues

1. **Logical Flow**:
   - The transition between discussing layoffs and wage cuts to historical context is abrupt. Consider adding a transitional sentence.

2. **Specificity**:
   - "Small pockets of AI" is vague. Specify what aspects of AI are being referred to.

3. **Cultural References**:
   - "In America We Trust" is a play on "In God We Trust," which may not be universally understood. Consider explaining or rephrasing.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The assumption that "every industry goes through this phase" is broad. Provide examples or context to support this claim.

5. **Personal Anecdote**:
   - The personal financial situation is mentioned abruptly. Integrate it more smoothly into the narrative or provide context earlier. [end of text]
