In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young girl named Lila who loved to tell stories. But her stories were always *exaggerating*—she’d say the sun was so bright it melted the rooftops, or that the wind carried whispers from distant stars. The villagers chuckled, but no one truly believed her.

One rainy evening, Lila sat by the window, hugging her favorite pillow—soft, worn, and stitched with tiny stars. She stared at the sky, where a single, slow-moving cloud drifted like a dream. It reminded her of her grandmother’s stories, the ones that weren’t exaggerated at all, but full of warmth and truth.

“Why do you always make things bigger than they are?” her mother asked gently, placing a warm cup of tea beside her.

Lila shrugged. “Because the real world isn’t exciting enough.”

But that night, a storm rolled in. Thunder cracked, and the wind howled like a wounded beast. Lila’s little brother, Finn, woke up screaming—afraid of the dark and the noise. She ran to his room, clutching her pillow like a shield.

“Don’t be scared,” she whispered, tucking the pillow under his head. “I’m here.”

Finn trembled. “What if the storm eats the house?”

Lila paused. Then, instead of saying the storm was a giant dragon or a sky monster, she said, “I know it sounds loud, but listen… the rain is just the sky singing. And that cloud? It’s not scary—it’s just tired, like us. It’s resting.”

She told him a story—not exaggerated, but kind. She spoke of a little cloud that carried dreams to children, and how it always came back to the sky, safe and warm.

Finn’s breathing slowed. He smiled. “Can I keep your pillow?”

Lila laughed. “Only if you promise to share it with me.”

That night, as the storm passed and the moon peeked through the clouds, Lila realized something. Her stories had always been about love—just wrapped in big words and wild images. But love didn’t need to be exaggerated to be powerful. It only needed to be *true*.

From then on, Lila still told stories—but now, they were full of quiet kindness, of hands held in the dark, of pillows shared and clouds that whispered comfort.

And the villagers, who once laughed at her exaggerations, began to listen. Because they learned: love doesn’t need to be loud or grand. It just needs to be real—like a pillow in the night, like a cloud above, like a voice that says, *I’m here.* [end of text]
