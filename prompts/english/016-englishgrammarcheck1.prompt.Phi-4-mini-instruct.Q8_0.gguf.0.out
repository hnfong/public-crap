### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)
1. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence" - "their" should be "their's" to indicate possession.
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - "he's" should be "he is" for correct tense.
3. "back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" - "it would be" should be "it would be" for consistency in tense.
4. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - "they can" should be "they could" for past tense consistency.
5. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "they're" should be "they are" for correct tense.
6. "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" - "is taking" should be "was taking" for past tense consistency.
7. "product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard" - "product enshittification" should be "product enshittification" for correct spelling.
8. "Those who read history knows" - "knows" should be "know" for subject-verb agreement.
9. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years" - "their careers would look like" should be "their careers would look like" for correct verb form.
10. "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced" - "isn't" should be "is not" for correct verb form.

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - The sentence structure is convoluted and could be simplified for clarity.
2. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." - The use of "in particular" is unnecessary and could be removed for brevity.
3. "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - The sentence is overly complex and could be broken down for better readability.
4. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - The phrase "pleases the shareholders in this regard" is awkward and could be rephrased.
5. "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." - The sentence is overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow. Breaking it into shorter sentences would improve clarity.

### Other Problems
1. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." - The phrase "the party's gonna end" is informal and could be replaced with a more formal expression.
2. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." - The phrase "what their careers would look like" is awkward and could be rephrased.
3. "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." - The phrase "always knew" is redundant and could be simplified to "I always knew."
4. "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)." - The sentence structure is complex and could be simplified for better readability.
5. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - The phrase "kill their golden goose" is idiomatic and could be replaced with a more formal expression for clarity. [end of text]
