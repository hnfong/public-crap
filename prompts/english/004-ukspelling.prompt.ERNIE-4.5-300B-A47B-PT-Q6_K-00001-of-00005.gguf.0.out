**The Rainbow’s Secret**  

Every summer, when the rain stopped and the sun peeked through, Lila raced to the old oak tree at the edge of her garden. There, she’d wait, breath held, for the rainbows to appear.  

But not just any rainbows—the *double* ones, where two arcs of colour nested together, bright and bold. Her nan said they were “magic gates” to faraway lands, and Lila believed her.  

One day, after a storm, the sky split into a double rainbow. Lila squinted, imagining the top arc was a bridge to a castle made of clouds. She waved, as if the colours could see her. “Hello!” she shouted. The wind ruffled her hair, and for a moment, she swore the rainbow shimmered back.  

Her cat, Whiskers, batted at a raindrop, breaking the spell. But Lila didn’t mind. She knew the rainbows would return, and next time, she’d pack a picnic to share with the fairies she was certain lived just beyond the violet.  

For now, she smiled, watching the colours fade, already counting the days until the next storm. [end of text]
