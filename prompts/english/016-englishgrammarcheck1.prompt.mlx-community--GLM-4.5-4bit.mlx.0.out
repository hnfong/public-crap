==========
Here are the grammar, stylistic, and other issues in the text, focusing on significant problems as requested:

### Grammar Mistakes (Tense/Agreement)
1. **"who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking"** - Pronoun-antecedent disagreement: "who" refers to "tech workers" (plural), but the phrasing is awkward. Better: "who are mostly diligent..."
2. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs"** - Tense shift: "had" (past) clashes with "can" (present). Should be "could" for consistency.
3. **"Those who read history knows"** - Subject-verb agreement: "Those" (plural) requires "know," not "knows."
4. **"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance"** - Capitalization inconsistency: "True Abundance" is unnecessarily capitalized unless it's a defined term.
5. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like"** - Missing preposition: "expectation of what" or "expectation about what" is needed.

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. **"McKinsey Pichai"** - Unclear reference: Likely a typo or slang (meant "Sundar Pichai" with "McKinsey" as a pejorative?), but it's confusing without context.
2. **"In America We Trust"** - Unconventional capitalization: Mimics "In God We Trust" but is jarring and unclear if intentional or error.
3. **"product enshittification"** - Overly informal/jargon: While vivid, this neologism may undermine professionalism in a serious analysis.
4. **"we're still sane though, just unique circumstances"** - Awkward phrasing: The parenthetical is disjointed and lacks clarity about the "unique circumstances."
5. **"the party's gonna end sooner or later"** - Overly colloquial: "gonna" is too informal for the otherwise analytical tone.

### Other Problems
1. **"if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled"** - Awkward construction: "how I participated" is unclear; better as "that I participated in and enabled."
2. **"besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller"** - Agreement error: "which" refers to "pockets" (plural) but uses "is" (singular). Should be "are."
3. **"FI" (Financial Independence)** - Undefined acronym: While common in finance circles, it may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
4. **"monotonic-increasing"** - Overly technical: This math term is out of place in a general discussion about careers.
5. **"there's actually no tech jobs here"** - Agreement error: "there's" (singular) with "jobs" (plural). Should be "there are."
