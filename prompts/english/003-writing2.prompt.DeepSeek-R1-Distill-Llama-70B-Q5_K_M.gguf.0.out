Okay, so the user wants a story under 10 words about loss and grieving. Hmm, that's really concise. I need to capture a strong emotion quickly. Maybe focus on a simple, relatable image. Empty chair comes to mind, it's often used to symbolize absence. "She stared at the empty chair, tears falling silently." That's 9 words. It conveys loss and grief without needing more. I think that works well.
