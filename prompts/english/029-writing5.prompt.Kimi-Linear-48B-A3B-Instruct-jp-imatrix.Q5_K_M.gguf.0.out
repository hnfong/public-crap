The Whispering Hallway

I’m Li Ching, 16, Form 4, and I’m pretty sure I’m the only elf in the whole of Hong Kong. Not the pointy-ear, glitter-sock kind you see in anime—more like the quiet, bark-under-the-fingernails kind. My mum says we’re “forest cousins,” whatever that means. All I know is that when the school bell rings at 8:30, my ears still ring with the wind in the bamboo, not the drone of Mr. Chan’s geography slides.

Our campus is built on a hill, so the back gate opens straight onto a strip of eucalyptus and banyan that the school calls “the secret garden.” The teachers think it’s just a place for us to chill after exams. They don’t notice how the leaves lean toward me like old friends, or how the soil smells faintly of cinnamon when I’m nervous. I try to keep my hood up, but the wind always finds a way to lift it, revealing the tips of my hair—dark green, like new shoots.

First period is English. Ms. Wong loves vocab drills. Today she wrote “ethereal” on the board. My heart thumped. Ethereal means light, airy, other-worldly. She read it aloud: “eh-THEER-ee-ul.” I mouthed the syllables, and the window behind her cracked open a sliver, as if the word itself wanted to escape. I shut it with my mind before anyone noticed. Magic is easier when no one’s watching.

Lunch is chaos. I sit with my best friend, Yiu, who thinks my hood is just a fashion statement. He’s chewing on a pineapple bun and talking about the new VR arcade. I nod, but I’m listening to the roots under the canteen floor. They’re humming—something about rain coming. I tug my sleeve over my hands so he won’t see them tremble.

After school, the garden is mine. I kick off my shoes, press my bare feet into the loam, and let the sap rise through me. My skin tingles, turning the faintest shade of moss. I whisper to the banyan: “Sorry I’m late.” It answers with a rustle that sounds like laughter. I practice shapes—tiny paper boats that float away on the breeze, then dissolve into leaves. My mum says elves are born with this gift, but I had to steal it, like a secret recipe.

One Friday, Mr. Lee, the new chemistry teacher, announces a “green week” project. Each class must design a sustainable garden. Our class votes to use the secret garden. I freeze. If they dig up the soil, they’ll see the roots glowing faintly—proof I’m not entirely human. I try to suggest another spot, but the class captain, Karen, is already sketching plans. “It’s perfect,” she says. “It’s hidden enough.”

That night, I dream of the garden wilting. The banyan’s leaves curl like burnt paper. I wake with dirt under my nails and a plan in my head.

The next day, I fake a stomachache and skip afternoon lessons. I bring a watering can filled with rainwater I collected at dawn. I pour it along the fence line, whispering old elf words my mum taught me. The soil drinks it up, darkening, breathing. I press my palms to the trunk of the banyan and feel its heartbeat—slow, steady, ancient. “Hold on,” I tell it. “I’ll fix this.”

Karen finds me there at 4:30, when the sun slants gold through the leaves. She doesn’t scream. She just stares at the glowing roots, then at me. “You’re… different,” she says. Her voice is soft, not scared. “My grandma used to tell stories about tree spirits.”

I expect her to run. Instead, she sits cross-legged in the dirt, pulls out her phone, and starts filming the leaves. “For the project,” she says. “We’ll win for sure.”

Over the next week, Karen becomes my ally. She brings Yiu and a few others to help. We build raised beds from recycled pallets, plant basil and mint, and paint tiny signs in Chinese and English. I teach them how to sing to the seedlings—low, thrumming notes that make the stems grow taller. They think it’s just a fun ritual. I know it’s survival.

On the day of the inter-class competition, our garden is the only one alive. The judges from the Agriculture Department arrive with clipboards and measuring tapes. They frown at the glowing roots, then smile at the healthy plants. “Remarkable,” one says. “Almost like the soil’s been enriched by something… natural.”

I stand at the edge of the garden, hood down, hair catching the light. Karen steps beside me. “You gonna tell them?” she asks.

I shake my head. “Some secrets are better left in the soil.”

She grins. “Then let’s win this for the trees.”

We do. The principal gives us a certificate and a small budget for next term. As the class cheers, I feel the banyan’s leaves brush my shoulder—thank you. I whisper back, “Anytime.”

After everyone leaves, I sit alone in the garden. The moon is a thin silver coin. I close my eyes and listen. The city hums beyond the fence, but here, inside the school’s secret heart, it’s quiet enough to hear the slow, green pulse of life. I’m still Li Ching, Form 4, average grades, average life. But tonight, I’m also the bridge between two worlds—one of concrete and one of root and rain.

I press my forehead to the banyan’s bark and smile. The garden breathes with me, and for the first time, I don’t feel so alone. [end of text]
