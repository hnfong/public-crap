**My Favourite Rainbows**

I love the rainbows that appear just after it rains. They are like magical bridges in the sky.

My favourite rainbow was the one I saw last spring. I was walking home from school when the sun came out after a heavy shower. Suddenly, there it was â€“ a beautiful arc of colours stretching across the sky.

The red was bright like strawberries, the orange glowed like autumn leaves, and the yellow shone like sunshine. The green reminded me of fresh grass, the blue looked like the ocean, and the purple was as pretty as lavender flowers.

I stopped walking and just stared. It felt like the rainbow was smiling at me. My little sister Emma was with me, and she jumped up and down with excitement.

"Mummy, Mummy! Look at the rainbow!" she shouted.

We watched it together until it slowly faded away. That evening, we drew pictures of rainbows and hung them on our bedroom walls.

Now, whenever it rains, Emma and I look out of the window, hoping to see another rainbow. They make us feel happy and remind us that even rainy days can be magical.

Rainbows are nature's way of saying "hello" after the rain. [end of text]
