After a sudden shower in the garden, I ran outside with my boots splashing in puddles. The sun peeked through the clouds, and there it was—a rainbow, bright and bold, arching over the old oak tree.

It wasn’t just one colour, but all of them, like a ribbon made of sweets. Red at the top, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet at the bottom. It stretched from the hedge to the far end of the field, as if the sky had painted it with a giant brush.

I stood still, watching it shimmer. The drops still hung in the air, catching the light like tiny mirrors. A robin hopped nearby, tilting its head as if wondering what magic this was.

I’ve seen rainbows in books and on postcards, but this one felt real—warm and alive. It made the world look kinder, like the sky was smiling.

When I blinked, it faded slowly, like a dream. But I knew it would come again, maybe tomorrow, or next week. And when it did, I’d be ready—boots on, heart full, and eyes wide open.

Rainbows are the sky’s quiet promise: after the storm, there’s beauty. And that’s the kind I like best. [end of text]
