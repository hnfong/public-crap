Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

A clever scenario!

It's likely that Bob didn't eat what he claimed to eat. The phrase "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat" sounds like a fancy and healthy dish, but the reaction "wtf" from Alice suggests that the reality is quite different.

A possible explanation is that Bob sent Alice a photo of a pizza, with the "aged organic milk" being mozzarella cheese, the "seasoned tomato purée" being tomato sauce, and the "baked whole wheat" being the crust. This would be a humorous and unexpected twist on Bob's initial claim of eating a healthy meal.
