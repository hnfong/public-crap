 1. In English, we use letters to represent numbers according to their place value in a base-10 positional numeral system. When counting whole numbers, we don't use the letter "A" until we reach 10 in decimal notation (one zero). However, if you're referring to a number's spelling in English words, the first whole number that uses the letter "a" is "one" (once).

2. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a dense and foggy forest, the three little pigs were building their houses. The first pig built his house with straw, the second with sticks, and the third with bricks. They worked diligently, and as they were finishing up, they heard a rustle in the bushes.

Out of the woods came Little Red Riding Hood, who was on her way to visit her grandmother. She saw the three little pigs and decided to take a break from her journey. She asked them about their houses, and they explained their different building materials and techniques.

Little Red Riding Hood shared her story of meeting the Big Bad Wolf and how she always made sure to stay safe. The three little pigs listened intently and thanked her for her advice. They invited her to stay with them for the night, and she gladly accepted.

The next day, Little Red Riding Hood continued her journey, but not before exchanging contact information with the three little pigs. They promised to visit each other soon, and the four of them remained good friends, always looking out for one another in their forest home. [end of text]
