Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):

1. "Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence" - The sentence is fine, but the use of "are" might be better as "were" if the statement is about a past event.
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" - The use of "he's" is fine, but if the subject is Andreessen Horowitz, it should be "it's".
3. "I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" - The use of "would be" is fine, but "would have been" might be more appropriate if the action is in the past.
4. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" - "ounce" should be "pint" or "pound" if referring to a measure of doubt, or "doubt" should be "doubts" if referring to multiple doubts.
5. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - The phrase "In America We Trust" is a play on words, but it might be better to clarify the meaning or use a different phrase.

Serious Stylistic Issues:

1. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" - The sentence is long and complex, which can be confusing for the reader. It might be better to break it into two sentences.
2. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" - The phrase "in say 15 years" is informal and might be better written as "in approximately 15 years".
3. "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" - The use of quotation marks around "high" is inconsistent with the rest of the text and might be better removed or replaced with italics.
4. "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another" - The verb "knows" should be "know", and "phrase" should be "phase".
5. "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry" - The term "FI" is not explained and might be better defined or removed if it's not necessary for understanding the text.

Other Problems:

1. "Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence" - The statement is subjective and might be better supported with evidence or examples.
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective" - The phrase "can't help but agree" is informal and might be better written as "I agree".
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" - The phrase "no ounce of doubt" is informal and might be better written as "I was certain".
4. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - The phrase "In America We Trust" is a play on words, but it might be better to clarify the meaning or use a different phrase.
5. "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry" - The term "FI" is not explained and might be better defined or removed if it's not necessary for understanding the text. [end of text]
