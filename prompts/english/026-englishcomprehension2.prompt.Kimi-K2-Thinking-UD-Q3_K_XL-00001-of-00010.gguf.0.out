We have a puzzle: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

We need to parse the puzzle. Let's rewrite:

- Initially, there is a stack of blocks: 3 black blocks on top of a block of unknown color. Beneath them (i.e., below the unknown block) is a blue block. So the stack from top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown, blue. So total 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue.

- Then we remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block. So we take the 5 blocks (3 black, unknown, blue) and add one green block, making 6 blocks total. Then we shuffle them (randomly) and put them back on top of each other (i.e., stack them). After shuffling and stacking, we have a new stack of 6 blocks.

- The yellow block is on top of blue block. So after shuffling and stacking, there is a yellow block somewhere, and it is on top of a blue block (i.e., directly above a blue block). So we have a yellow block directly above a blue block in the new stack.

- The question: What color is the block we don't know the color of? So we need to deduce the unknown color.

We need to find the unknown color given the constraints. The puzzle likely uses logic about colors and perhaps the fact that we have a yellow block that wasn't originally present? Wait, originally we had black, unknown, blue. No yellow. Then we add a green block. So after shuffling, we have 6 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green. But we also have a yellow block? The puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." That suggests there is a yellow block in the new stack. But we didn't have a yellow block originally. However, we added a green block, not yellow. So where does yellow come from? Possibly the unknown block is yellow? Or perhaps the unknown block is yellow and we didn't know its color initially. But the puzzle says "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So the unknown block is between the black blocks and the blue block. Then we remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block. So after shuffling, we have a yellow block on top of a blue block. That suggests that the unknown block must be yellow, because we didn't have any other yellow block. But we also added a green block, which could be yellow? No, green is not yellow. So the only way to have a yellow block after shuffling is if the unknown block is yellow. However, we also have a green block added. So after shuffling, we have a yellow block (the unknown block) and a green block (added). So the unknown block is yellow.

But we need to check if any other possibilities exist. Could the unknown block be something else, and the yellow block is the green block? No, green is not yellow. Could the unknown block be green? Then we would have a green block (unknown) and an added green block, making two green blocks. But then where does yellow come from? There is no yellow block. So the only way to have a yellow block is if the unknown block is yellow. So answer: yellow.

But we need to be careful: The puzzle might be a trick: The unknown block could be any color, but after shuffling, we have a yellow block on top of a blue block. The only way for that to happen is if the unknown block is yellow, because we didn't have any yellow block originally, and we added only a green block. So the only source of a yellow block is the unknown block. So answer: yellow.

But we need to consider if there could be multiple yellow blocks? No, we only have one unknown block. So the unknown block must be yellow.

Thus answer: yellow.

But we need to ensure we answer in one word only, no explanation. So answer: yellow.

Thus final answer: yellow.

But we need to double-check the puzzle's phrasing: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Interpretation: Initially, we have a stack: top: black, black, black, unknown, blue. Then we remove all blocks (so we have 5 blocks: 3 black, unknown, blue). Then we shuffle the blocks with one additional green block (so we add a green block to the set, making 6 blocks). Then we put them back on top of each other (i.e., we stack them in some order). After stacking, we observe that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So there is a yellow block in the stack, and it is directly above the blue block. So the unknown block must be yellow, because we didn't have any other yellow block. So answer: yellow.

Thus answer: yellow.

But we need to consider if there is any other nuance: Could the unknown block be green, and the yellow block be the added green block? No, green is not yellow. Could the unknown block be blue? Then we would have two blue blocks (the original blue and the unknown blue). Then after shuffling, we could have a yellow block on top of a blue block, but we still need a yellow block. The unknown block being blue doesn't provide a yellow block. So we need a yellow block somewhere. The only source is the unknown block. So unknown must be yellow.

Thus answer: yellow.

Thus final answer: yellow.

We need to output only one word: "yellow".yellow [end of text]
