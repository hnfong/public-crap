Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. The First Use of the Letter "A" in Number Spelling
You would have to count to **one thousand** (1,000) before using the letter "A" in the standard English spelling of a whole number.

*   **Reasoning**: If you spell out the numbers from one to nine hundred ninety-nine, none of them contain the letter "A".
    *   1–9: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
    *   10–19: ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.
    *   20–99: twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety (plus the ones listed above).
    *   100–999: "hundred" does not contain an "A".
*   The first number to include the letter "A" is **one thousand** (spelled: o-n-e **t-h-o-u-s-** **a** **n-d**... wait, actually "thousand" is spelled t-h-o-u-s-**a**-n-d).
*   *Correction*: Let's re-verify the spelling of "thousand". It is T-H-O-U-S-**A**-N-D. Yes, the letter "A" appears in "thousand".
*   Therefore, the first whole number containing the letter "A" is **1,000** (one thousand).

*(Note: If you consider "and" as part of the standard British English convention for numbers like "one hundred and one," the letter "A" would appear much earlier, at 101. However, in standard American English and strictly mathematical contexts where "and" is often omitted for whole numbers, 1,000 is the first instance.)*

### 2. The Famous Sentence
**Completed Sentence:**
"The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**."

**What it is famous for:**
This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. Because it contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet, it is frequently used to:
*   Test typewriters and computer keyboards.
*   Display font samples to show how every letter looks in a specific typeface.
*   Practice handwriting or typing speed.

### 3. A Short Story: The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, in a forest where the trees whispered secrets, the Three Little Pigs were having a picnic near the edge of the woods. The first pig, who had built his house of straw, was now enjoying a life of leisure. The second pig, from the stick house, was telling jokes, and the third pig, the architect of the brick house, was carefully checking the structural integrity of a nearby bridge.

Suddenly, a rustling in the bushes revealed a girl in a bright red cloak carrying a basket. It was Little Red Riding Hood. She looked confused, her eyes darting around nervously.

"Excuse me," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "I'm looking for my grandmother's house, but the path seems to have changed, and I heard a wolf howling nearby."

The three pigs stopped their activities immediately. The third pig, the most cautious, stepped forward. "A wolf? That sounds like trouble. We've had our own run-ins with a wolf who tried to blow our houses down."

"He's very strong," the first pig added, shivering at the memory. "But he can't blow down brick."

Little Red Riding Hood sighed. "I'm afraid he's already ahead of me. He told me he was going to eat my grandmother, and then he said he'd come back for me."

The three pigs exchanged determined glances. "We can't let that happen," said the second pig. "We know the forest better than anyone. Follow us."

They led Little Red Riding Hood not to her grandmother's house directly, but to the third pig's sturdy brick house. "Wait here," the third pig instructed. "We will go ahead and check the path. If the wolf is there, we will trap him."

The three pigs marched out, using their knowledge of the forest to set a clever trap. They lured the wolf into a clearing where the first pig had set up a giant fan (made of straw) and the second pig had built a flimsy stick wall. When the wolf arrived, panting and hungry, he saw the "easy" targets. He took a deep breath and blew, but the fan caught the wind and blew the wolf's fur back, disorienting him. He tried to knock down the stick wall, but it was rigged to collapse on top of him, trapping him in a pile of sticks.

Just then, the third pig and Little Red Riding Hood arrived. The wolf, tangled and confused, was no match for the combined strength of the pigs and the brave girl. They tied him up with vines and called the forest ranger.

"Thank you," Little Red Riding Hood said, smiling as she hugged the three pigs. "I thought I was alone, but I found the best friends in the forest."

From that day on, the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were inseparable, proving that even the smallest of friends could overcome the biggest of wolves when they worked together. [end of text]
