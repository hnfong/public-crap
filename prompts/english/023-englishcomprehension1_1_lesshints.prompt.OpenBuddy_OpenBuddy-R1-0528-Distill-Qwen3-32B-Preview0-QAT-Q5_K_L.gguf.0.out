Based on the distinctive writing style of the article, I would guess that it was written on April 1st. The article contains several humorous and satirical elements, such as the author's exaggerated complaints about Rust and the mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. Additionally, the article's tone and content suggest that it is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, rather than as a serious critique of Rust or a genuine endorsement of C++. All of these factors are consistent with the tradition of April Fools' Day pranks and jokes. [end of text]
