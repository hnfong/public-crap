### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)
1. **"And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers"** - The preposition "to" should be "as" to correctly form the phrase "seem as an unwarranted assault."
2. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something"** - The phrase "onto something" should be "on something" for correct grammar.
3. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic"** - The phrase "on the same line of logic" should be "along the same line of logic" for better clarity.
4. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations"** - The verb "can" should be "could" to match the past tense of the sentence.
5. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose"** - The phrase "In America We Trust" should be "In America, we trust" for proper grammar and capitalization.

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."** - The phrase "basically saying" is informal and could be replaced with a more formal phrasing like "allegedly stating."
2. **"And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."** - The parenthetical "(GOOG mainly)" is unnecessary and interrupts the flow of the sentence.
3. **"With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency"."** - The use of quotes around "high" and "efficiency" is incorrect and should be removed.
4. **"Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another."** - The phrase "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know" to correct the subject-verb agreement.
5. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."** - The phrase "the party's gonna end" is overly informal and should be replaced with "the party is going to end" for a more formal tone.

### Other Problems
1. **"In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG."** - The phrase "in particular META and GOOG" should be "in particular, META and GOOG" to include a comma for clarity.
2. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."** - The phrase "while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG)" should be "while META and GOOG, and particularly GOOG," to include commas for clarity.
3. **"The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."** - The phrase "In America We Trust" should be "In America, we trust" for proper grammar and capitalization.
4. **"With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency"."** - The use of quotes around "high" and "efficiency" is incorrect and should be removed.
5. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."** - The phrase "the party's gonna end" is overly informal and should be replaced with "the party is going to end" for a more formal tone.
