**The Hidden Quill of Oakwood High**

I, Ling Wong, sit in Mrs. Patel's English class, trying to focus on today's lesson about Shakespeare's sonnets. But my mind keeps drifting away, like leaves on a breezy day in the forest. You see, I have a secret. A secret that would make my classmates think I'm crazy, or worse, a character from a fantasy novel. I am not just Ling Wong, a 16-year-old student at Oakwood High. By the light of the full moon, I transform into a wood elf named Lirien of the Silverleaf Clan.

**Morning Chaos**

My day starts like any other student's. Wake up early, quick breakfast (usually congee with mom), and rush to catch the bus. But amidst the hustle, I perform a silent, personal ritual—a whispered prayer to the Ancient Oak, seeking balance between my two worlds. My backpack, a ordinary-looking thing to others, contains not just textbooks but also a hidden compartment. Inside, a quill made from a swan's feather and ink crafted from the soot of a fire lit under a full moon. My wood elf's tool, always with me.

In class, I struggle to keep my pointed ears (hidden under carefully styled hair) from perking up at the slightest sound of nature outside. The rustle of leaves, the chirping of birds—each a reminder of the forest that calls to me. Mrs. Patel mistakes my distant gaze for disinterest, but little does she know, I'm translating Shakespeare's metaphors into the poetic language of the elves.

**The Struggle is Real**

Lunchtime is the hardest. While my friends, May and Ken, chat about the latest K-drama, I must control my appetite for the forest's bounty. No, Ling, you cannot eat the grass in the school yard, no matter how much it resembles the sweet, glowing blades of the Elven Meadows. I settle for a sandwich, feeling like a part of me is starving.

**After School, Under the Sun**

Club activities are my cover. The School Gardening Club, to be precise. Here, I can nurture my connection with nature without arousing suspicion. Today, we're planting trees in the new school garden. As my hands dig into the earth, I feel the pulse of the land, a sensation that never fails to comfort me. For a brief moment, with dirt under my fingernails and the sun on my face, I am both Ling and Lirien, at peace.

**Nightfall, Transformation**

The full moon rises. I sneak out, not to a party or a study group, but to the old, secluded part of the forest just beyond the city's edge. The transformation is never painful, just a tingling sensation as my senses heighten, my ears lengthen, and my eyes glow softly in the dark. Lirien of the Silverleaf Clan steps into the moonlight.

Under the canopy, I practice archery, my quill now a bow, the ink, arrows that shimmer with a soft, ethereal light. I am one with the night, a guardian of this border between the human and elven worlds.

**Back to Dawn, Back to Ling**

Before the first light of dawn, I return, transforming back into Ling. Exhausted but fulfilled, I jot down my elven thoughts with my secret quill, the ink now a deep, forest green on the page of my diary.

**The Diary Entry**

"Dear Self,

Today, in English class, I understood Shakespeare's sonnet in a way I never thought possible. The 'star-cross'd lovers' reminded me of the forbidden love between an elf and a mortal, a tale passed down in our clan. I wonder, would Romeo and Juliet's love have flourished under the moon, away from the hatred of men?

Until next night,
Lirien (Ling)"

**The End**

As I drift off to sleep, the line between Ling and Lirien blurs once more, ready to face another day of balancing two worlds, one secret, and the eternal quest to belong in both. [end of text]
