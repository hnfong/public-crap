I'd be happy to answer your questions!

1. You would have to count to 1000 before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number, as "A" is the first letter in the word "Thousand".

2. The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, a phrase that uses all the letters of the alphabet at least once. It is often used as an example in typing and typing games.

3. Here's a short story about the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood:

Once upon a time, the three little pigs were busy building their new homes in a sunny meadow. The first little pig was building his house out of straw, the second little pig was building his house out of sticks, and the third little pig was building his house out of bricks.

As they worked, they heard a knock on the door. It was Little Red Riding Hood, who was on her way to visit her sick grandmother in the nearby woods. The three little pigs invited her in for a snack and a chat.

Little Red Riding Hood was impressed by the pigs' new homes and asked them about their building techniques. The first little pig boasted about how quickly he had built his straw house, but the second little pig warned him that it might not be strong enough to withstand the Big Bad Wolf.

Just then, the Big Bad Wolf appeared at the door, trying to trick the pigs and Little Red Riding Hood into letting him in. But the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were too clever for him. They worked together to chase the wolf away and then sat down to enjoy a lovely picnic lunch together.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became great friends and would often have adventures together in the meadow and the woods. [end of text]
