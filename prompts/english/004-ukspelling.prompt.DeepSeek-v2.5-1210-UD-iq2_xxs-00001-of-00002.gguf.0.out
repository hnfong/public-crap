**The Rainbow I Love**

I love rainbows. They are so pretty and colourful. When the sun shines after the rain, I always look up to see if there’s one.

My favourite rainbow is the one that stretches across the sky, like a big, bright bridge. It has all the colours of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. They all blend together so smoothly, like a magic paintbrush painted the sky.

Sometimes, I see rainbows in puddles on the pavement after the rain. They’re not as big as the ones in the sky, but they’re just as lovely. I like to imagine that the rainbow is a secret door, and if I step through it, I’ll find a land of sweets and toys.

Rainbows always make me smile. They remind me that even after a rainy day, the sun comes out, and something beautiful can happen. I think rainbows are a sign that the world is full of surprises, and I can’t wait to see the next one. [end of text]
