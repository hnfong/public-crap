3. Here's a short story about the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood:

One sunny day, the three little pigs were out for a walk in the forest, enjoying the warm breeze and the sound of birds singing. As they strolled along, they came across Little Red Riding Hood, who was on her way to visit her grandmother. The pigs were immediately drawn to her bright red cloak and introduced themselves.

Little Red Riding Hood was delighted to meet the three little pigs and asked them about their homes. The first little pig, who had built his house out of straw, proudly showed off his abode. But Little Red Riding Hood was concerned about the straw house, remembering her own encounter with the Big Bad Wolf. She warned the first little pig that his house might not be safe.

The three little pigs thanked Little Red Riding Hood for her warning and decided to visit their brother's houses to check on their safety. The second little pig, who had built his house out of sticks, was also warned by Little Red Riding Hood. But the third little pig, who had built his house out of bricks, was confident that his home was safe.

Just then, the Big Bad Wolf appeared, trying to trick Little Red Riding Hood and the three little pigs. But the clever group was prepared. The three little pigs invited Little Red Riding Hood to join them in the brick house, and together they outsmarted the Big Bad Wolf. From then on, Little Red Riding Hood and the three little pigs became the best of friends, always looking out for each other and having exciting adventures together in the forest. [end of text]
