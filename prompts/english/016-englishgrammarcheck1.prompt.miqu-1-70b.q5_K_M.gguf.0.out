 Grammar and Agreement Issues:
1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The phrase "there's a running story" is informal and could be replaced with "There is an ongoing narrative" for better clarity and formality.
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - The phrase "he's probably onto something" is colloquial and could be replaced with "he likely has a valid point" for a more formal tone.
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..." - The phrase "on the same line of logic" is awkward and could be replaced with "followed the same logical thread" for better clarity.
4. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - The phrase "McKinsey Pichai" is incorrect. It should be "Sundar Pichai", the CEO of Google.
5. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - The phrase "In America We Trust" is awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity and formality, such as "Given the capitalist nature of the American economy, it is unlikely that regulators will..."
6. "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away..." - The phrase "held 'high'" is informal and could be replaced with "maintained at elevated levels" for better formality.
7. "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium..." - The phrase "cuts/stagnation" is awkward and could be replaced with "stagnation or reductions" for better clarity.
8. "Those who read history knows..." - The verb "knows" should be in the plural form "know" to agree with the plural subject "those".
9. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..." - The phrase "I mean" is colloquial and could be omitted for a more formal tone.
10. "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry..." - The use of quotation marks around 'FI' is unnecessary and could be replaced with italics or omitted entirely for better clarity.

Stylistic Issues:
1. The text is written in a conversational tone, which may not be appropriate for all audiences or contexts.

4. The text contains several parenthetical asides that disrupt the flow of the argument.
5. The text contains several instances of hedging language (e.g. "probably", "likely", "basically") that could be omitted for a more confident tone.

Other Issues:
1. The text contains several assumptions and generalizations about the tech industry and its workers that may not be accurate or fair.
2. The text contains several value judgments (e.g. "predatory capitalist attitude", "ruthless capitalist engine") that may not be shared by all readers.
3. The text contains several references to specific companies and individuals (e.g. "Andreessen Horowitz", "Sundar Pichai") that may not be familiar to all readers.
4. The text contains several speculative statements about the future of the tech industry that may not be accurate or supported by evidence.
