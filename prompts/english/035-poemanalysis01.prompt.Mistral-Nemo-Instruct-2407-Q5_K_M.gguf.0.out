The given text appears to be a critique or commentary on a specific aspect of a game, possibly Super Mario Bros. Here's a thorough analysis:

1. **Context**: The text seems to be discussing the physics or mechanics of a game, likely Mario, given the reference to "Mario" later on. The phrase "inertia of running" suggests that the speaker is referring to the momentum Mario gains while running.

2. **Critique**: The speaker is criticizing the game's handling of Mario's momentum. They believe that once Mario gains a certain amount of inertia from running, he becomes difficult to control, leading to the next point.

3. **Consequence**: Due to the difficulty in controlling Mario's momentum, the speaker believes that Mario is likely to "slip into the abyss." This could mean that Mario falls into a pit or off a cliff, leading to a game over.

4. **Opinion**: The speaker concludes with "skill issue," which is a gaming term used to dismiss a complaint about a game's difficulty. It implies that the speaker believes the problem lies not with the game's mechanics, but with the player's skill level. They are suggesting that if the player were more skilled, they would be able to control Mario's momentum and avoid falling into the abyss.

In essence, the speaker is criticizing the game's momentum mechanics, but they believe that the issue is not with the game, but with the player's skill level.
