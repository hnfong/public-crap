So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the issues I found:

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." should be "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying that people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." (missing "that")
2. "who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "whom I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement)
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" should be "My analysis back then was exactly in line with the same logic" (idiomatic expression)
4. "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" should be "it seems their monopolies are still functional, and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from them before things break down" (missing comma)
5. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they could cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (verb tense consistency)

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text jumps abruptly from discussing Andreessen Horowitz's statement to the author's personal experience with considering buying tech stocks. A transition sentence or phrase would help to connect the ideas.
2. The text uses overly casual language and slang (e.g. "FI", "levels.fyi", "enshittification"), which may not be familiar to all readers.
3. The author's tone is inconsistent, veering between sarcastic and serious.
4. The text includes several asides and tangents (e.g. the comment about McKinsey Pichai, the mention of "small pockets of AI"), which disrupt the flow of the main argument.
5. The author's use of rhetorical questions (e.g. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make... might wonder why I live so frugally") feels forced and unnatural.

**Other Problems:**

1. The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the tech industry and specific companies (e.g. Andreessen Horowitz, META, GOOG), which may not be familiar to all readers.
2. The author's argument is not clearly structured or supported with evidence, making it difficult to follow or evaluate.
3. The text includes several vague or undefined terms (e.g. "the capitalist perspective", "the ruthless capitalist engine"), which need to be clarified or explained.
4. The author's personal anecdotes and opinions are not clearly distinguished from more general arguments or observations.
5. The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points, leaving the reader feeling uncertain about the author's overall argument or message. [end of text]
