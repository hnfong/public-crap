Okay, the user wants a short story that teaches about the importance of love, with specific words: pillow, cloud, and exaggerating. Let me unpack this. 

First, the core request seems simple—a moral-driven narrative where love is the central lesson. But why those particular words? Maybe they want concrete sensory details (pillow/cloud) and a touch of humor or realism (exaggerating). The user might be looking for something heartfelt but not saccharine, with relatable flaws in characters.

Hmm, the word "exaggerating" stands out—it suggests the story could benefit from a character who misunderstands or amplifies emotions. That feels human. A child protagonist would work well; kids often magnify small hurts but also love fiercely. 

For structure: Start with conflict (perceived lack of love), escalate tension (using the required words naturally), then resolve with emotional clarity. The pillow can symbolize comfort withheld/given, the cloud as emotional weight lifting. 

Setting-wise, a family home feels right—intimate and universal. Dad working late is a classic scenario for a child to feel neglected. The lesson should show love as action, not just words. 

Wait—should I avoid being too preachy? Yes. The moral must emerge organically. Maybe through a parent's quiet gesture (like fixing a pillow) that contrasts the child's dramatic interpretation. 

Also, the user didn’t specify audience age, but the simplicity leans toward all-ages. I’ll keep prose accessible. 

*Brainstorming arc:* 
- Kid feels ignored, exaggerates loneliness 
- Pillow becomes a metaphor (lumpy = discomfort) 
- Dad’s return: gentle actions dissolve the "cloud" 
- Revelation: love is in consistent care, not grand displays 

Final touch: The word "exaggerating" in dialogue to call out the child’s perception, making the epiphany stronger. 

...Time to write.

The lump in Maya’s pillow felt like a stubborn rock. She punched it, flopped over, and stared at the ceiling. Downstairs, the low murmur of the TV and the clink of dishes meant Dad was home, *finally*. But he hadn’t even come up to say goodnight. Again.

"He doesn't care," Maya whispered fiercely to her stuffed rabbit, Mr. Flops. "He loves his boring reports more than me." The thought settled over her like a heavy, grey **cloud**. She wasn't just sad; she felt utterly forgotten. Maybe she was **exaggerating** a little, but wasn't it basically true? He worked late, ate dinner silently, and vanished into his study. Love wasn't supposed to feel this empty.

The next morning, Maya stomped downstairs, determined to be invisible. She poured cereal with angry clatters. Dad looked up from his newspaper, his eyes tired. "Morning, sunshine. Sleep okay?"

"Fine," Maya mumbled, not meeting his eyes. *Sunshine? Yeah, right.*

The day dragged. At school, her friend Lila gushed about baking cookies with her dad. Maya just shrugged. "My dad’s too busy for stuff like that." The heavy cloud pressed down harder.

That night, Maya went to bed early, the lumpy pillow a physical echo of her mood. She heard Dad come home later than usual. Resentment simmered. Then, her door creaked open. She squeezed her eyes shut, pretending to sleep. Footsteps padded softly across the room.

She felt gentle hands. Dad was carefully lifting her head. He pulled out the lumpy pillow and replaced it with the soft, cool one from the guest room – the one she loved. He smoothed her hair back, his touch impossibly tender. Then, he leaned down and placed the lightest kiss on her forehead. "Love you, Maya-bean," he whispered, his voice thick with exhaustion.

He left as quietly as he came. Maya lay perfectly still, tears pricking her eyes. The new pillow was blissfully soft. The heavy, grey **cloud** of loneliness and resentment that had weighed her down all day... it just dissolved. Vanished.

She hadn't been forgotten. He *had* noticed her quiet anger at breakfast. He *had* remembered her complaint about the lumpy pillow weeks ago. He *had* come straight to her room, tired as he was, to fix it. Love wasn't always in big declarations or constant attention. Sometimes, it was in the quiet, weary actions – replacing a **pillow** in the dark, a whispered goodnight, showing up even when you're drained.

She realized she *had* been **exaggerating**. He wasn't absent; he was just stretched thin, showing love in the ways he could, right now. The warmth spreading through her chest wasn't just from the soft pillow; it was the profound understanding that love was there, solid and real, even when it wasn't loud. It was in the showing up, especially when it was hard. She hugged Mr. Flops tightly, the last of the sadness melting away, replaced by a deep, quiet gratitude. [end of text]
