Here are the grammar, agreement, and serious stylistic issues found in the text:

### Grammar and Agreement Issues

*   **Missing Preposition:** In the second paragraph, the phrase "seem to an unwarranted assault" is missing the preposition "be." It should read: "seem to **be** an unwarranted assault."
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** In the fifth paragraph, the subject "Those" is plural, but the verb "knows" is singular. It should read: "Those who read history **know**."
*   **Missing Preposition:** In the sixth paragraph, the phrase "expectation what their careers would look like" is missing the preposition "of." It should read: "reasonable expectation **of** what their careers would look like."
*   **Tense Consistency:** In the third paragraph, the text shifts from past tense ("I had no ounce of doubt") to present tense ("they can cut costs") within the same thought process describing a past analysis. It should likely remain in the past: "I had no ounce of doubt that they **could** cut costs..."
*   **Pronoun Case:** In the second paragraph, the relative pronoun "who" is used as the object of the preposition "of." While common in casual speech, the grammatically correct form is the object pronoun "whom." It should read: "work ethic of tech workers (**whom** I'm sure are mostly diligent...)."

### Serious Stylistic and Usage Issues

*   **Malapropism/Word Choice:** In the fifth paragraph, the word "phrase" is used incorrectly to describe a stage of development. The correct word is "phase." It should read: "every industry goes through this **phase**."
*   **Non-Standard Idiom:** In the third paragraph, the phrase "I had no ounce of doubt" is an awkward construction of the standard idiom. It would be stylistically stronger as: "I didn't have a shadow of a doubt" or "I was certain."
*   **Capitalization for Emphasis:** In the fourth paragraph, the capitalization of "In America We Trust" mimics the motto "In God We Trust," but in this context, it reads as improper capitalization of a common phrase. It should be lowercased unless used as a specific proper noun title.
*   **Awkward Phrasing:** In the third paragraph, the phrase "on the same line of logic" is slightly non-standard. The standard idioms are "along the same lines" or "on the same page."
*   **Informal/Slang Usage:** In the fifth paragraph, the word "shitty" is used to describe job quality. While acceptable in casual conversation, it clashes with the otherwise analytical and somewhat formal tone of the surrounding economic commentary. [end of text]
