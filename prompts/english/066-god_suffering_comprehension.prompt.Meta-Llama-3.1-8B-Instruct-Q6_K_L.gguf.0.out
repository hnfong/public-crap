Here are the answers to the questions:

1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil are subjective experiences that we choose to experience, and that our existence is a personal choice to experience the world in a particular way. According to the text, God's creation is infinite and all-encompassing, and we are vessels for experiencing this creation. Our subjective experiences, including suffering and evil, are a result of our choices about how to experience the world.

2. I don't agree with the text's thesis. While it's true that our perception of reality is subjective and influenced by our individual experiences and choices, it's not clear that we can simply "choose" to experience suffering and evil as if they are not real. The text's view seems to downplay the impact of systemic and structural factors that contribute to suffering and evil, such as poverty, oppression, and violence.

3. Here's a short poem based on the text:

We choose our path, our way to be
A subjective experience, unique to me
God's creation is vast and wide
We're vessels for it, side by side

We see the world through our own eyes
And choose what we want to realize
Suffering and evil, a choice to make
Or so the text would have us partake

But is it really that simple, you see?
Can we just choose to be free?
Or are there forces beyond our control?
That shape our experiences, young and old? [end of text]
