1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a rush? Do you think they won't wait for you?
2. Suggested sentence: He is a magnanimous person and doesn't bother with trivial issues with the kids.
3. Original sentence: There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. Suggested sentence: Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle.
5. Original sentence: I take the metro to school every day. 

Note: The original sentence in point 3 is already simple, fluent, and to the point, so no changes are needed. However, if you want to make it even more concise, you could say: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires massive exposure." But the original sentence is perfectly fine. 

For point 4, "小新" is translated as "Siu-san" which is likely a transliteration of his name. If you want to make it more natural, you could say "Siu Xin" or just "Xin" if you don't want to use the Cantonese pronunciation. However, the suggested sentence above keeps the original name and makes the rest of the sentence more natural. 

For point 5, the original sentence is simple, fluent, and to the point, so no changes are needed.
