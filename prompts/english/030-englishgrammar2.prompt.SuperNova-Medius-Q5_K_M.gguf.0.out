Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations and suggest modifications, keeping in mind sentences should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. If the sentence does not need changes, just output the original sentence.

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States will held a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. Suggested sentence: The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. Suggested sentence: The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output the original sentence if no changes are needed.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a rush? Do you think they won't wait for you?
2. Suggested sentence: He is a magnanimous person and doesn't bother with trivial issues with the kids.
3. Original sentence: There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. Suggested sentence: Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle.
5. Original sentence: I take the metro to school every day. 

Note: The original sentence in point 3 is already simple, fluent, and to the point, so no changes are needed. However, if you want to make it even more concise, you could say: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires massive exposure." But the original sentence is perfectly fine. 

For point 4, "小新" is translated as "Siu-san" which is likely a transliteration of his name. If you want to make it more natural, you could say "Siu Xin" or just "Xin" if you don't want to use the Cantonese pronunciation. However, the suggested sentence above keeps the original name and makes the rest of the sentence more natural. 

For point 5, the original sentence is simple, fluent, and to the point, so no changes are needed. 

Here are the final suggested sentences:

1. Why are you in such a rush? Do you think they won't wait for you?
2. He is a magnanimous person and doesn't bother with trivial issues with the kids.
3. There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle.
5. I take the metro to school every day. 

If you want to make point 4 even more natural, you could say: "Siu-san often praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle." But the suggested sentence above is also fine. 

Final suggested sentences:

1. Why are you in such a rush? Do you think they won't wait for you?
2. He is a magnanimous person and doesn't bother with trivial issues with the kids.
3. There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. Siu-san often praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle.
5. I take the metro to school every day. 

Or, if you want to keep it as simple as possible:

1. Why are you in such a rush? Do you think they won't wait for you?
2. He is a magnanimous person and doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. Siu-san often praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle.
5. I take the metro to school every day. 

Both versions are acceptable, but the first one is slightly more natural.
