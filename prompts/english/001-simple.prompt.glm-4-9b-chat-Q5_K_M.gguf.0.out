1. To determine how high you would have to count before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number, we need to consider the number of digits in the number. The letter "A" is used in the spelling of numbers starting from 1,000,000,000 (one billion). Therefore, you would have to count up to one billion before using the letter "A" in the spelling of a whole number.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet at least once. This makes it a pangram, a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet.

3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs met the little red riding hood in the enchanted forest. The pigs were on their way to build their new houses, and the little red riding hood was on her way to visit her grandmother. As they crossed paths, the little red riding hood asked the pigs for directions to her grandmother's house. The first little pig, who lived in a straw house, suggested she take the path that was the shortest. The second little pig, who lived in a stick house, advised her to take the path that was the safest. The third little pig, who lived in a brick house, recommended she take the path that was the fastest. The little red riding hood thanked the pigs for their advice and continued on her way, safe in the knowledge that she had the best guidance from the three little pigs.
