Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Alright, I need to determine the date when this passage was written. The hint provided is that the writing style is distinctive and connected to one particular day and month of the year. Let's delve into the content to identify any clues that might hint at a specific date.

First, I notice that the author has been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years. This suggests that the passage was written sometime after Rust was established as a programming language. Rust was first announced in 2010, so the date should be after that.

Next, the author mentions frustrations with Rust's ecosystem, specifically the near-monoculture of Cargo. Cargo is Rust's default package manager and build system, which was introduced in Rust 1.0 in 2015. This indicates that the passage was written after Rust 1.0 was released.

The author pines for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++, which has been a mature language since the 1980s. However, the emphasis on C++'s evolving features, such as modules in C++20 and future enhancements like stackful coroutines in C++26, suggests that the passage was written after these features were introduced or were in the planning stages.

The mention of C++26 and the potential for new syntax and languages like Carbon indicates that the passage was written in a timeframe where these features were being discussed or developed. C++26 is a speculative version, as the current major version is C++20, with C++23 and C++26 being future milestones.

The author also references the C++ community's leadership, particularly mentioning Stroustrup's paper on safety. This suggests that the passage was written after Stroustrup's contributions were well-documented and recognized within the C++ community.

The hint about the distinctive writing style being connected to a particular day and month of the year is intriguing. Perhaps the author chose to write this passage on a day that holds special significance, such as a birthday, anniversary, or a day associated with a particular event related to Rust or C++.

Considering all these factors, the passage likely was written in the mid to late 2020s, given the references to C++20 and the speculative C++26 features. The distinctive writing style connected to a specific day and month could be tied to a significant date in the author's personal or professional life related to Rust or C++.

Additionally, the mention of seeking collaborators for the C++ rewrite and inviting people to join the Zulip instance suggests that the passage was written in a timeframe where such collaborative efforts were actively being pursued, which aligns with the mid to late 2020s.

Taking all these clues into account, the most plausible date for the passage is sometime in 2023, around the time when C++20 was well-established and C++26 was being discussed or planned.
