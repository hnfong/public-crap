Alright, I need to determine the date when this passage was written, using the hint that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month of the year. Let's start by analyzing the content and style of the passage to identify any clues that might hint at a specific date.

First, the passage discusses the author's involvement with Rust and the Rust community, expressing frustrations with Rust's ecosystem and a preference for the more mature and flexible build systems available in C++. The author also touches on safety concerns, language evolution, and the community aspects of both Rust and C++. There's a clear sentiment of moving away from Rust to C++ for the Linebender projects.

Now, considering the hint about the distinctive writing style being connected to a particular day and month, I need to think about what writing styles are typically associated with specific dates. One possibility that comes to mind is the style associated with the release of a significant software update or a major event in the programming community. For instance, the release of a new version of a programming language or a major update to a build system could coincide with a particular day or month.

Looking at the content, the passage mentions the Rust ecosystem and its build systems, Cargo, and other alternatives like Bazel and CMake. It also references C++20 and future C++ versions, indicating that the author is keeping up with the latest developments in both Rust and C++. This suggests that the passage was written around the time of a significant event related to Rust or C++.

Another angle is to consider the release dates of major programming language updates. Rust has had significant releases, such as Rust 1.0 in 2015 and Rust 1.50 in 2020. However, the passage doesn't specify a particular version, so it's not directly tied to a release date.

Focusing on the writing style, the passage seems to be written in a reflective and somewhat critical tone, possibly after experiencing challenges with Rust's ecosystem. This could indicate that the author wrote the passage after a period of frustration or after making a decision to switch to C++.

Considering the hint about a distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month, I recall that certain programming conferences or events occur on specific dates. For example, the RustConf happens annually, and the C++Now conference also has a fixed date each year. If the author attended or was influenced by such an event, that could provide a clue.

Additionally, the mention of the C++ core guidelines and the evolution of the C++ language suggests that the author is up-to-date with the latest developments, which might coincide with the release of new C++ standards or updates.

Reflecting on all these points, the writing style seems mature and informed, possibly reflecting the author's experiences and observations over a period. The hint about a distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month might be referencing the timing of a significant event in the programming community that influenced the author's perspective.

Considering all these factors, I'm inclined to think that the passage was written around the time of a major C++ conference or a significant update to the C++ language, such as the release of C++20 in 2020. This would align with the author's discussion of C++20 features and the evolution of the language.

However, without more specific clues, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact date. The writing style suggests a reflective and informed tone, possibly after a period of contemplation or after experiencing challenges with Rust's ecosystem, which might have led the author to reconsider their stance on Rust and lean towards C++.

In conclusion, based on the content and the hint about the distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month, the passage was likely written around the time of a major C++ event or update, such as the release of C++20, which occurred in 2020.
