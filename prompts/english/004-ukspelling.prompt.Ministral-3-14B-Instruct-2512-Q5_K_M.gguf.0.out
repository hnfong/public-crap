**The Best Rainbow Ever**

One sunny afternoon in Yorkshire, I was skipping stones on a pond near my grandma’s cottage. The sky was blue, and the water was still—perfect for rainbows.

Then, *plink!* My last stone bounced just right. A splash! And—oh!—a rainbow arched over the pond like a giant’s painted bridge. But this wasn’t just any rainbow. It had *extra* colours—deep purples, bright oranges, and a stripe of pink so soft it looked like cotton candy.

I gasped. "Grandma!" I shouted. She peeked out the window, her tea cup paused. "Lovely, isn’t it?" she said.

I nodded. This rainbow wasn’t just pretty—it felt *magic*. The colours shimmered, and for a moment, I swore I saw a tiny dragon’s head peeking out from behind the green. (Don’t tell anyone—I might be imagining things.)

As the sun dipped lower, the rainbow faded. But I’ll never forget it—the one with the secret sparkle, just for me.

Now, whenever it rains, I look for *that* rainbow. And sometimes… I still half-expect to see a dragon. [end of text]
