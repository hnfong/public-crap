**The Cloud Beneath Her**  

Lila had always believed love was overrated—a concept people exaggerated to feel less alone. She’d built her life around logic, not sentiment, until the day her grandmother, Mabel, fell ill.  

Mabel’s bedroom smelled of lavender and old books. She lay propped against a mountain of pillows, her voice as fragile as the lace doily on her nightstand. “The sky’s been *so* blue today,” she’d say, or “That cloud looks like a dragon, doesn’t it?” Lila would nod, rolling her eyes. *Exaggerating*, she thought. Clouds were just clouds.  

One afternoon, Mabel gestured weakly to the window. “Fetch me a pillow, dear. I want to see the sky better.” Lila obliged, plumping the pillow behind her grandmother’s head. As she did, Mabel whispered, “Love is like a cloud, Lila. You can’t hold it, but it’s always there, softening the fall.”  

Lila scoffed. “That’s… poetic, but clouds disappear.”  

Mabel smiled. “So do we. But what matters is what they leave behind.”  

Days later, Mabel was gone. Lila found herself staring at the sky, searching for dragons or anything her grandmother had seen. One afternoon, as she lay on the grass, a cloud drifted overhead—a fluffy, impossible shape that *did* resemble a dragon. Tears pricked her eyes. She realized Mabel hadn’t been exaggerating. She’d been translating the invisible: the way love lingers, even when the person is gone.  

That night, Lila hugged Mabel’s favorite pillow, its fabric still faintly scented. Outside, the moon hung like a silent promise. Love wasn’t a trap, she understood now. It was the cloud beneath her, catching her when she fell. [end of text]
