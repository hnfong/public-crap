**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would first encounter the letter "A" in the spelling of the number **one thousand ("one thousand")**. However, let's check the numbers in order:

- 1: one (no "a")
- 2: two (no "a")
- 3: three (no "a")
- 4: four (no "a")
- 5: five (no "a")
- 6: six (no "a")
- 7: seven (no "a")
- 8: eight (no "a")
- 9: nine (no "a")
- 10: ten (no "a")
- 11: eleven (no "a")
- 12: twelve (no "a")
- 13: thirteen (no "a")
- 14: fourteen (**contains "a"**)

So, the first time the letter "A" appears in the English spelling of a whole number is at **fourteen**.

**Answer:** You would have to count up to **14 (fourteen)** before you use the letter "A" in the spelling of a whole number.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, in a forest not far from a village, three little pigs set out to build their own homes. The first pig built his house of straw, the second of sticks, and the third, being the most industrious, built his house of bricks.

One sunny day, as the pigs were admiring their homes, they heard a gentle voice nearby. It was Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother. She was surprised to see the three little pigs and greeted them warmly.

The pigs invited her to rest and share a snack. As they chatted, they heard a familiar huffing and puffing. It was the Big Bad Wolf, who had caught the scent of fresh straw and sticks. He tried to blow down the first two pigs' houses, but they quickly ran inside and were safe.

Red Riding Hood, clever as ever, helped the pigs by suggesting they all hide in the brick house. Together, they waited until the wolf gave up and wandered away. Grateful for their teamwork, the pigs and Red Riding Hood celebrated their safety with a feast.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, always looking out for each other in the forest.

And they all lived happily ever after.
