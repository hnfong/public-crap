Based on the content and the distinctive writing style of the passage, I would guess that this was written on April 1, 2021. Here's why:

1. **April Fools' Day Hint**: The passage has a humorous and somewhat exaggerated tone, which is characteristic of April Fools' Day pranks. The author's claims about moving from Rust to C++ and the reasons given seem overly dramatic and satirical, fitting the spirit of April Fools' Day.

2. **References to Future C++ Features**: The author mentions C++26 and potential features like stackful coroutines, a safe range-based for loop, and a new syntax proposed by Herb Sutter (cppfront). As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, these features are still in the future, but the timeline fits with an April 1, 2021, date.

3. **Community and Political Comments**: The author's comments about the Rust community being "imperious" and the C++ community being "nicer and friendlier" are quite stereotypical and exaggerated, which aligns with the playful nature of April Fools' Day posts.

4. **Call to Action**: The invitation to discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust is a common way to engage the community on April Fools' Day, encouraging a lighthearted debate.

5. **Writing Style**: The overall tone and style of the passage, including the mock-serious arguments and the playful jabs at both Rust and C++ communities, are indicative of an April Fools' Day prank.

By combining these elements and considering the hint about the distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month, April 1, 2021, seems to be the most plausible date for this passage. [end of text]
