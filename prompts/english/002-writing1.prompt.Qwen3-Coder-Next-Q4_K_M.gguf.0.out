**The Cloud Who Learned to Love**

In the sky above the sleepy village of Thistledown, lived a fluffy white cloud named Puff. Puff was known for two things: his dramatic rain showers and his habit of *exaggerating*—always turning a drizzle into a deluge, or a breeze into a hurricane. “I’m not *exaggerating*,” he’d puff proudly. “I’m *amplifying*!”

One evening, as Puff drifted lazily over the village, he spotted a little girl named Elara sitting on her porch, hugging a worn-out *pillow* and staring at the stars. Her eyes were red.

“Ah!” Puff boomed, rolling his thunder for effect. “A storm is coming! A tempest of tears! I shall unleash the Great Deluge of Gloom!”

Elara didn’t flinch. She simply whispered, “I’m not sad about the rain, Puff. I’m sad because my grandmother moved far away. I miss her.”

Puff paused. His usual dramatic flair faltered. He’d never heard sadness spoken so quietly.

Curious, he drifted lower, just above her roof. “Why do you hug that *pillow*?” he asked, softer now.

“It smells like her,” Elara said, hugging it tighter. “She used to tuck me in and tell stories until I fell asleep. Sometimes, I pretend she’s right here.”

Puff felt something unfamiliar stir inside him—not rumbling, but warmth. He remembered how, long ago, he’d been a tiny droplet in a gentle stream, carried by kindness from mountain to sea. He’d forgotten that.

The next morning, Elara woke to find her windowpane covered in delicate frost—*not* ice, but tiny, shimmering hearts, each one shaped like a cloud. And on her pillow, a single dewdrop glistened like a tear of joy.

That day, Puff didn’t exaggerate. He didn’t roar or rumble. He simply let a soft, warm breeze brush Elara’s hair—and for the first time, he whispered, “I’m here.”

Love, he learned, wasn’t in the loud or the grand. It lived in quiet moments—the pillow pressed close, the cloud that chose to stay, the truth spoken without *exaggerating*.

And sometimes, love was just enough. [end of text]
