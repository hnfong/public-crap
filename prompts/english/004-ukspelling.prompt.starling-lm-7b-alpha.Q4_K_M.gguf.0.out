Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there was a magical rainbow. It was the most beautiful rainbow anyone had ever seen. It had all the colours of the rainbow, from red to blue, and it sparkled in the sunlight.

Every day, the children of the village would look up at the sky and see the magical rainbow. They would point and laugh and play under it. The rainbow made them happy and they loved it very much.

One day, the village was hit by a terrible storm. The wind blew and the rain poured down. The children were scared and they ran inside their homes. They looked out of the window and saw that the magical rainbow was gone.

The children were very sad. They missed their magical rainbow and they wanted it back. So they decided to do something about it. They all went outside and started to dance and sing. They danced and sang until the storm passed and the sun came out.

And then, there it was! The magical rainbow appeared in the sky again. The children were so happy and they knew that their magical rainbow was back to stay.

And they all lived happily ever after, knowing that their magical rainbow would always be there to make them happy.

The End.
