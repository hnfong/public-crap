1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil are not inherent in the universe but are subjective experiences shaped by individual choices—people choose what to experience, including pain and suffering—because they perceive or desire such experiences, and thus, these are not objective truths but personal interpretations.  

2. I agree with the core idea that suffering is not a universal or divine necessity but a product of subjective perception and choice. While suffering is real and painful for many, the text offers a powerful philosophical shift: it reframes suffering as a consequence of how we engage with reality, not as a flaw in a perfect divine order. This aligns with existential and phenomenological views that emphasize personal agency and experience over external moral absolutes.  

3.  
God made all, no flaw, no flaw,  
We choose what to feel, not what to know.  
Suffering? Just a choice we made—  
A world we built, not one we found.  
We walk through pain, but we can choose—  
To move, to heal, to grow, to go. [end of text]
