## Answers:

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering exists because God created *everything*, including all possible experiences. Humans, as vessels for experiencing creation, subjectively choose what they experience, even suffering and evil. Therefore, suffering isn't an inherent flaw in God's creation, but a result of individual choices and beliefs about reality.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

I find the idea intriguing, though difficult to fully accept. While the concept of agency and subjective reality resonates, attributing all suffering to personal choice feels dismissive of systemic injustices and unavoidable hardships. It's a compelling philosophical perspective, but lacks practical empathy for those experiencing genuine trauma.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

A boundless God, a cosmic art,
Creates all things, a brand new start.
We are the vessels, feeling deep,
Subjective worlds our souls do keep.

If pain you find, or shadows loom,
Remember choice within the room.
For what you see, and what you feel,
Is born of will, profoundly real.

Believe it not, or let it be,
Your universe, for you to see.
A past decision isn't stone,
A different path can still be known.
