In the heart of the countryside, young Lily loved to explore. One sunny afternoon, after a brief shower, she looked up and saw something magical. A rainbow arched across the sky, its colours vibrant and bright.

Lily's favourite part of the rainbow was the way the colours blended together. The red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet seemed to dance in the sky, creating a beautiful spectrum. She thought it looked like a giant, colourful bridge connecting the earth to the heavens.

As she walked through the meadow, she noticed smaller rainbows in the droplets of water on the leaves. These tiny rainbows sparkled in the sunlight, making the whole world seem magical. Lily smiled, knowing that even the smallest things could hold the most beautiful wonders.

From that day on, Lily always looked for rainbows after the rain. She found joy in the way they painted the sky with colour and turned ordinary moments into something extraordinary. Rainbows, to Lily, were nature's way of saying that even after the storm, there was always something beautiful to look forward to. [end of text]
