3. **Short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:**  
   Once upon a time, the three little pigsâ€”Pig One, Pig Two, and Pig Threeâ€”were building their houses. While Pig One and Pig Two were busy constructing straw and stick houses, Pig Three was busy baking a cake. Suddenly, a wolf appeared, but instead of huffing and puffing, he was chasing a little red riding hood. The wolf, confused, asked, "Why are you here?" The little red riding hood replied, "Iâ€™m on my way to Grandmaâ€™s house!" The wolf, realizing he was out of place, left. The pigs, relieved, invited the little red riding hood to their party. They all lived happily ever after, sharing stories and cake. ðŸŽ‰ [end of text]
