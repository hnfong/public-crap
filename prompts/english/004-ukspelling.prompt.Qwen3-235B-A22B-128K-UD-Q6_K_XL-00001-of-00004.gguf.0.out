I love rainbows that appear after a storm. The sky is still a little grey, and the air smells fresh and clean. That’s when I see them—those bright, bold stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, stretching right across the sky.

My favourite kind of rainbow is the one that pops out when the sun starts to peek through the clouds again. It feels like a secret message from the sky, telling us the rain is gone and it’s time to smile.

Once, after a heavy shower, I saw a double rainbow while walking home. The second one was fainter, but it made me stop and stare. It looked magical, like something from a fairy tale.

Rainbows remind me that even after the darkest clouds, something beautiful can shine through. They make me feel happy and hopeful, just like the children I write for.

That’s why I always include a rainbow in my stories. It’s a symbol of kindness, wonder, and the joy of seeing the world in colour. [end of text]
