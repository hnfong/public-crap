**Title: The Last Message in the Bottle**  

The sea had always been a silent witness to human folly. For centuries, it swallowed ships, dreams, and secrets alike, only to return them in fragmentsâ€”shattered wood, rusted anchors, and the occasional, improbable message in a bottle.  

Eleanor had never expected to find one.  

She was walking the desolate stretch of beach near her cottage, the kind of place where the wind whispered more than people did. The tide had just retreated, leaving behind a mosaic of shells and seaweed. And there, nestled in the damp sand, was a glass bottle. Not new, not tourist trashâ€”this one was old, its surface frosted with age, the paper inside brittle as a leaf.  

With trembling hands, she pried off the cork. The note inside was written in ink faded to near nothing, but the words were still legible:  

*"If you find this, the world has ended. Or maybe itâ€™s just me. Either way, I hope someone is still out there. My name is Clara. I was born in 1898, and Iâ€™m writing this the year 1912. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll survive the iceberg. But if I donâ€™t, tell them I loved the stars. Tell them I tried."*  

Eleanor stared at the paper, her chest tight. Clara had been wrong about the icebergâ€”but right about the world ending. Just not hers.  

She wondered how many other bottles like this were buried in the sand, waiting for a reader who would never come.  

And then she wondered if *she* should write one too.
