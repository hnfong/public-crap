The best rainbows come after the rain stops. Not just a shower, but a proper downpour—the kind that drums on the slate roof and turns the lane to mud. Then, when the clouds suddenly crack open and the sun slips low, *that’s* when the magic happens.

I like the ones that arch over the Welsh hills, thin and bright as spun sugar, with the wet grass shining below. Or the double rainbow that hung above the Thames last Tuesday—two perfect bows, the outer one pale and shy, like it wasn’t sure it belonged. My favourite, though, is the one that streaks across the playground after summer rain. The children stop mid-chase, their jumpers still damp, and point. No one shouts. They just watch, quiet, as if the sky had whispered a secret only they could see.

That’s the rainbow I like: quiet, sudden, and free. Like hope you didn’t ask for. Like a promise the clouds forgot to keep, but gave anyway. [end of text]
