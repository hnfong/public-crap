**The Pillow and the Cloud**  

Lena had always been a dreamer, her head in the clouds—sometimes quite literally. She loved to lie on her soft, feathery pillow and imagine herself floating among the billowing white clouds above.  

One evening, as she sighed dramatically, her grandmother chuckled. "You’re exaggerating, my dear. The sky isn’t *that* far away."  

Lena frowned. "But it feels like it. I wish I could touch the clouds, just once."  

Her grandmother smiled and handed her a small, worn-out pillow. "This was your grandfather’s. He used to say love makes the impossible feel close—like holding a cloud in your hands."  

Confused, Lena hugged the pillow. Suddenly, warmth spread through her, and for a moment, she swore she felt weightless, as if floating.  

The next morning, she ran outside, the pillow clutched tight. The sky seemed brighter, the clouds nearer. She realized then—love wasn’t about reaching the impossible. It was about carrying the warmth of those who loved you, making even the farthest dreams feel within reach.  

And so, Lena kept the pillow close, a reminder that love could make even the sky feel like home. [end of text]
