**The Pillow and the Cloud**

Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a young girl named Lila. She was known for her curious mind and her habit of exaggerating everything—especially her dreams.

One day, while walking home from school, Lila stumbled upon an old, dusty pillow lying in the middle of the road. It was soft and worn, with a faded blue cover that looked like it had once been part of a grand bed. She picked it up, brushed off the dirt, and decided to take it home.

That night, Lila placed the pillow on her bed and fell asleep. In her dream, she found herself floating high above the clouds, where the sky was painted in hues of pink and gold. She was standing on a giant, fluffy cloud that felt just like the pillow she had found.

As she walked across the cloud, she met a wise old owl who lived in a tree made of cotton candy. The owl told her, “This cloud is a symbol of love. It may seem soft and gentle, but it can carry you through the stormiest skies.”

Lila was puzzled. “But how can a cloud teach me about love?”

The owl smiled. “Because love is like a cloud—it surrounds you, supports you, and lifts you up when you feel heavy. But it’s not always easy to see. Sometimes, you have to look beyond the surface.”

The next morning, Lila awoke with a strange sense of peace. She looked at the pillow on her bed and realized that it had been a gift all along. It wasn’t just a pillow—it was a reminder of the cloud she had seen in her dream, and the lesson it had taught her.

From that day on, Lila stopped exaggerating her stories and started paying attention to the little things in life. She learned that love wasn’t something grand or dramatic—it was the quiet moments, the gentle support, and the softness of a pillow that could carry her through even the darkest days.

And so, Lila lived happily ever after, always remembering the pillow and the cloud that taught her the true meaning of love. [end of text]
