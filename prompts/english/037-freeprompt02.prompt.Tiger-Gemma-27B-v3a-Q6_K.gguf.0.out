## The Dust Motes in God's Attic

Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn't particularly old, just… worn. He ran the Curiosity Shop on the edge of town, a place crammed with chipped porcelain dolls, tarnished silver lockets, and books bound in something that smelled faintly of cinnamon and regret. But the real draw wasn't the objects themselves, it was Tiber's stories. And his favorite story, the one he'd tell only to those who lingered long enough, was about the attic of God.

Not *a* god, mind you. *God*. The one before the pantheons, the one that breathed existence into being like a bored child blowing bubbles. Tiber claimed this God, after creating everything, got tired of it. Too much noise, too much suffering, too much… *finite*. So He built an attic. 

Not a physical attic, of course. More like a conceptual one. A space outside of space, before time, where discarded possibilities went to gather dust. Every universe that never was, every choice unmade, every path not taken, all swirling in a silent, infinite accumulation. 

The attic wasn't empty. It was filled with dust. Not the kind you sweep up, but the dust of unrealized potential. Each mote a complete, functioning reality, shimmering with the ghost of what *could* have been. A universe where dinosaurs never died, where humanity evolved into sentient coral, where gravity worked sideways. Each one perfect, self-contained, and utterly unreachable.

Tiber said the God sometimes came up to the attic, not to admire His failures, but to… feel the weight of them. To run His fingers through the infinite dust and remember the sheer, overwhelming scope of what He'd abandoned. He'd pick up a mote, hold it to the light, and see a world bloom for a fleeting moment before letting it fall back into the swirling chaos. 

"The funny thing," Tiber would whisper, leaning close, his breath smelling of pipe tobacco and something older, "is that even *that* attic isn't the end of it. Because for every mote of dust, there are an infinite number of infinitesimally smaller motes within it. Universes within universes, possibilities within possibilities, stretching down forever. It's not just infinite, it's infinitely infinite."

He'd pause, letting the weight of that sink in. 

"And the worst part? We're just one of those motes. A flickering, fragile reality, destined to eventually settle back into the dust. The only difference is, we don't even know who the God is who's watching us fall."

The shop bell would jingle then, breaking the spell. Someone would cough, or shift their weight, and the moment would be gone. But the image lingered: an endless attic, choked with the ghosts of what might have been, and the terrifying realization that even infinity has a basement. 

Because if the attic is infinite, then the space *around* the attic must be even more so. And if that's true, then the God who built it… well, He must be something beyond comprehension. Something that makes even the idea of infinity feel small and insignificant. 

And that, Tiber always said, was the real horror. Not the dust, not the lost worlds, but the sheer, unyielding, terrifying scale of everything that *isn't*. The infinite darkness that surrounds the infinite light, waiting for everything to fall silent.
