1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**
   You would have to count to **one thousand** before you encounter the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number. The first number to include an "A" is **one thousand and one** ("one thousand and one" contains an "A" in "and").

   - Before that, the letter "A" does not appear in the words for numbers from 1 to 999 (e.g., "one," "two," "three," ..., "nine hundred ninety-nine").

**The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**

One crisp autumn morning, the three little pigs were playing outside their houses when they spotted a familiar figure walking down the path. It was Little Red Riding Hood, her basket slung over her arm and a basket of treats for her grandmother.

"Good morning, Red!" the first little pig called out. "Where are you off to?"

"To visit my grandmother," Red replied. "But I’m worried about the wolf who lives nearby. He’s been causing trouble."

The second little pig, who had built his house of sticks, chimed in. "Don’t worry, Red! We’ll help you. We’ve been dealing with our own wolf troubles."

Just then, the third little pig, whose house was made of bricks, added, "We’ve built strong houses to keep out the wolf. Maybe we can help you too!"

Red smiled. "That would be wonderful! But I’m not sure how."

The three little pigs exchanged glances and then had an idea. "Come with us to our houses," said the first pig. "We’ll show you how we’ve outsmarted the wolf."

Red followed them to the first pig’s house of sticks. As they entered, the wolf suddenly appeared outside, puffing and blowing. "Little pig, little pig, let me in!" he huffed.

The first pig, though nervous, stood his ground. "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!"

The wolf tried to blow the house down, but the sticks held firm. "I’ll come back!" the wolf growled and stomped away.

Next, they visited the second pig’s house of straw. The wolf returned, puffing even harder. "Little pig, little pig, let me in!"

The second pig, though shaky, refused. "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!"

Again, the wolf failed to blow the house down and left in a huff.

Finally, they went to the third pig’s house of bricks. The wolf returned one last time, determined to get inside. "Little pig, little pig, let me in!"

The third pig, confident in his strong home, replied, "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!"

The wolf tried to blow the house down, but the bricks were too strong. Frustrated, the wolf gave up and slunk away.

Red Riding Hood clapped her hands. "You’ve outsmarted the wolf! Now, let’s help you too."

The three little pigs and Red Riding Hood worked together to build a sturdy path to Grandmother’s house, lined with bricks and sticks to keep the wolf at bay. They also left a trail of breadcrumbs (though they quickly realized that might not be the best idea—better to leave something the wolf couldn’t follow!).

When they arrived at Grandmother’s house, they found the wolf had already tried to sneak in. But thanks to their cleverness, he couldn’t get past the strong door.

As the sun began to set, the three little pigs and Red Riding Hood sat down to share a meal with Grandmother. They had outwitted the wolf together, proving that teamwork and cleverness could overcome even the trickiest of foes.

And from that day on, whenever the wolf came around, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were always ready with a plan to keep him at bay. They even started a little club called the "Houses That Stand Tall and Friends Who Stand Together."
