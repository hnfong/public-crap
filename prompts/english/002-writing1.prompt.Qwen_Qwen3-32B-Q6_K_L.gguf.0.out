Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a young girl named Lila. She was known for her kindness, but also for her habit of **exaggerating**. Whether it was how tall the trees were or how fast the wind blew, Lila always added a little extra to her stories.

One day, while sitting on a soft **pillow** under her favorite tree, Lila watched the sky. A fluffy **cloud** drifted by, and she said, “That cloud is as big as a castle!” Her little brother, Milo, giggled and said, “No, it’s just a cloud.”

Lila smiled and said, “Well, maybe not a castle, but it’s still magical.” She often told Milo stories about the clouds, the stars, and the wind, always adding a touch of imagination.

One evening, their parents left for a week-long trip. Lila was excited at first, but as the days passed, she began to feel lonely. Milo, who was only five, missed their parents too. He cried at night, and Lila tried to cheer him up with her stories, but nothing seemed to help.

On the third night, Milo whispered, “I miss Mom and Dad.”

Lila, who had always been the one to make things seem bigger and brighter, suddenly realized something. She had been **exaggerating** the world around her to make it more exciting, but now she saw that sometimes, the smallest things mattered most.

She sat beside Milo on the soft **pillow**, and instead of telling a grand tale, she simply said, “I miss them too. But we can still love each other, even if they’re not here.”

Milo looked up at her, his eyes wide. “You mean… love can stay even when things are quiet?”

Lila nodded. “Yes. Love isn’t about big clouds or tall trees. It’s about being here for each other, even when the world feels small.”

From that night on, Lila stopped **exaggerating** so much. She still told stories, but now they were filled with real feelings, real moments, and real love. And Milo, who had once been afraid, now felt safe and warm in the arms of his sister.

Years later, when they were grown, Milo would often say, “You taught me that love isn’t about how big the cloud is, but how soft the **pillow** feels when someone holds you.”

And Lila would smile, knowing that sometimes, the quietest moments hold the most love. [end of text]
