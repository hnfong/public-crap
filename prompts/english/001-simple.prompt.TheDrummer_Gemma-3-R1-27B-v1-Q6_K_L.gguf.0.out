**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

The third little pig, Percy, was meticulously reinforcing his brick house when he heard a rustle in the nearby woods. He peeked out and saw a little girl in a bright red hood skipping down the path. Behind her, he thought he saw a flash of grey fur.

"Hello!" Percy called out. "Are you alright?"

The girl, Little Red Riding Hood, stopped, clutching a basket. "Oh, hello! I'm on my way to Grandma's, but I think... I think a wolf is following me!"

Percy's ears perked up. He remembered the stories his brothers, Pip and Pop, told of a big bad wolf. He quickly called for them. Pip, whose house of sticks was nearby, and Pop, whose straw house was even closer, came running.

"A wolf?" Pip squeaked, nervously adjusting his twig roof.

"We must help her!" Pop declared, though his voice trembled.

Percy, the practical one, said, "We'll lead him away from you. You run straight to Grandma's. We'll distract him."

Little Red Riding Hood, wide-eyed, nodded gratefully. "Thank you! Thank you so much!" She darted off down the path.

The three little pigs stood together, a surprisingly sturdy front. Soon, a gruff voice boomed, "Well, well, well... what have we here? Three little piggies!"

The wolf, indeed, was following Little Red Riding Hood's scent. He grinned, showing sharp teeth. "I'm having pork for dinner!"

Pip and Pop trembled, but Percy stood firm. "You'll have to get past us first!"

The wolf huffed and puffed, trying to blow down Pip's stick house. It wobbled, but held. He then turned to Pop's straw house, and with one mighty blow, it scattered like dandelion fluff. Pop squealed and ran to Percy's brick house.

The wolf, frustrated, charged at Percy's house. He huffed and puffed, he blew and he blew, but the brick house stood strong. Exhausted and defeated, the wolf slunk away, muttering about stubborn pigs and brick walls.

Inside the sturdy brick house, Little Red Riding Hood arrived safely, breathless but relieved. "You saved me!" she exclaimed, hugging Percy. "And you saved your brothers too!"

The three little pigs smiled. They learned that day that even the smallest act of kindness, and a strong brick house, could make all the difference. And Little Red Riding Hood learned that sometimes, the best heroes wear curly tails and snouts.
