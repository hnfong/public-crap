Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the rain, but her favourite thing was the rainbow that came after. One rainy day, Lily was playing in her garden when the sun peeked out from behind the clouds. Suddenly, a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky. It had seven bright colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Lily ran to the window to get a better look. She imagined the rainbow was a magical bridge that could take her to a land of wonders. She waved at it, and it seemed to shimmer in response. Lily felt so happy and hopeful, like anything was possible. She decided to paint the rainbow in her sketchbook, so she could remember it forever. That rainbow was her favourite, because it made her believe in magic and dreams. [end of text]
