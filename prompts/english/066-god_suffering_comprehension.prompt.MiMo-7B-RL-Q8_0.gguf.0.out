Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a text that discusses the existence of suffering in the world in the context of a divine being. The main points seem to be that suffering is a result of our subjective choices and that we have agency in our experiences, even if we don't feel it. The text argues that what we perceive as evil or suffering is actually a personal choice in our subjective experience, and that we have the power to change our perspective or circumstances.

First, for question 1, I need to summarize the main thesis. The text seems to suggest that suffering exists because we choose to perceive it, and our experiences are shaped by our subjective agency. The key ideas are that God creates everything, including our experiences, and that our perception of suffering is a personal choice rather than an inherent evil.

For question 2, I need to state whether I agree. Here, I should consider the philosophical stance presented. The idea that suffering is a subjective choice might be controversial. On one hand, it offers a sense of control and responsibility. On the other, it might downplay actual suffering caused by external factors. I should acknowledge both sides but present a balanced response.

Question 3 requires a poem that rhymes, based on the text's content. The poem should touch on themes of choice, subjective experience, and agency. Using rhyming couplets or a consistent rhyme scheme would help. Maybe start with the concept of choosing experiences, then mention suffering as a perspective, and conclude with the ability to change.

I need to make sure the answers are concise, especially the poem. Let me check the text again to ensure I didn't miss any key points. The emphasis is on the idea that we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our subjective experiences, including suffering, are shaped by our choices. The text also mentions that even in primitive tribes without large-scale suffering, their lack of exposure is a choice, and being informed is another choice.

So, the main thesis is that suffering is a result of our subjective choices and perceptions, not an inherent flaw in a divine creation. We have agency in our experiences, even if we feel lacking in control. 

For my agreement, I can say that while the perspective offers empowerment, it might oversimplify complex realities. The poem should reflect that balance, perhaps suggesting that our choices shape our experiences, but suffering is a part of the landscape we can navigate.

Now, structuring the poem. Maybe start with the choice of experiences, mention the "raw" or "darkness" as part of creation, then the power to shift perspective, and ending with a call to embrace agency. Rhyming with words like "choice," "voice," "sprout," "clout." Let me draft a few lines and check the flow and rhymes.

Putting it all together, ensuring the poem is short and rhymes effectively. Also, keeping it aligned with the text's message without being too literal. Once the poem is done, review it to make sure it captures the essence: subjective experience, choice, and the power to change.

**1. Main Thesis:**  
The text argues that suffering exists not as an inherent flaw in a divine creation, but as a subjective experience shaped by personal choice. Our perception of "evil" or suffering is a product of our agency in shaping how we experience reality, with God’s role being the creation of all possibilities, including our individual perspectives.  

**2. Do I agree?**  
Conditionally. The perspective empowers individuals by framing suffering as a choice rather than an external force, fostering self-agency. However, this risks oversimplifying systemic or collective pain, reducing it to personal preference. While subjective experience matters, it may not fully account for objective realities affecting many.  

**3. Poem:**  
*We choose the tides, the stars, the weight of night,*  
*Yet cling to the shadow where the demons fight.*  
*The wound? A lens—refracting light to dark,*  
*For God’s creation thrives in paradox’s spark.*  
*To suffer is to sculpt the world we bear,*  
*A raw alchemy where soul and void meet there.*  
*The path? Not run, but spun—kneading time’s dough,*  
*Each breath a verse where meaning grows.*  

*(Note: "spun" and "dough" rhyme; "verses" and "grows" slant-rhyme.)* [end of text]
