Sure, here are the identified issues in the text:

### Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):

1. **Tense Inconsistency**: The text switches between present and past tense without a clear reason. For example, "So there's a running story" (present) and "back when tech stocks were down last year" (past).
2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "There's a running story" should be "There is a running story" for proper subject-verb agreement.
3. **Pronoun Reference**: "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" (assuming the reference is to the CEO of Google).
4. **Parallel Structure**: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" should be "In the end, I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated participating in and enabling this kind of predatory capitalist attitude."
5. **Sentence Fragment**: "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." This sentence is a fragment and should be combined with the previous sentence for clarity.

### Serious Stylistic Issues:

1. **Wordiness**: The text is overly wordy and could benefit from more concise language. For example, "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." could be simplified.
2. **Repetition**: The phrase "GOOG" is repeated multiple times unnecessarily. It would be better to refer to it as "Google" for clarity.
3. **Informal Tone**: The text uses an informal tone that may not be suitable for all audiences. For example, "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."
4. **Lack of Clarity**: Some sentences are unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. For example, "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another."
5. **Inconsistent Capitalization**: The text inconsistently capitalizes company names and titles. For example, "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" and "META" should be "Meta."

### Other Problems:

1. **Lack of Citation**: The text makes claims about the opinions of Andreessen Horowitz and the performance of tech companies without citing any sources.
2. **Assumptions**: The text makes assumptions about the work ethic of tech workers and the future of tech companies without providing evidence.
3. **Bias**: The text has a strong bias against big tech companies and their practices, which may affect the objectivity of the analysis.
4. **Predictions**: The text makes predictions about the future of tech companies and the job market without providing a clear basis for these predictions.
5. **Personal Opinions**: The text includes personal opinions and anecdotes that may not be relevant to the main argument. For example, "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."

By addressing these issues, the text can be improved for clarity, coherence, and objectivity. [end of text]
