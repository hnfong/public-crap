**1. Main Thesis (≤3 sentences)**  
God is an all‑creating, all‑supporting principle that generates every possible experience. Human suffering and “evil” are not external facts but subjective choices—each of us selects what to perceive and experience, and we can always change our perspective or location. Thus, any suffering we encounter is ultimately a result of our own chosen focus, not an inherent flaw in God’s creation.

**2. Agreement (concise)**  
I find the idea that suffering is a matter of perspective interesting, but it feels overly deterministic and dismissive of genuine suffering that people cannot simply “choose away.” While agency is real, many hardships arise from systemic forces beyond individual control, so reducing them to personal choice seems reductive.

**3. Poem (rhy‑ish)**  

*If God makes all that is, why do we sigh?*  
*We choose the world we see, the clouds and the sky.*  
*Our pain, a lens we hold, a path we trace—*  
*Shift the gaze, shift the world, find a new space.* [end of text]
