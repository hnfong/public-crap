Here are the identified issues, categorized as requested. Only **grammar (especially tense/agreement)** and **serious stylistic issues** are included—minor stylistic or structural concerns are omitted per instructions.

### **Grammar / Agreement / Tense Issues**  
1. **"In America We Trust"** — Incorrect capitalization and punctuation. Should be either *“In America, we trust”* (if quoting a phrase) or rephrased; as written, it’s grammatically incorrect (missing subject/verb agreement, improper capitalization of “We” and “Trust” in mid-sentence).  
2. **"Those who read history knows"** — Subject–verb agreement error. *“Those”* is plural → should be *“know”*, not *“knows”*.  
3. **"every industry goes through this phrase"** — *“Phrase”* is incorrect here; the intended word is almost certainly *“phase”* (a period of time), not *“phrase”* (a linguistic expression). This is a **serious lexical error**, not just stylistic.  
4. **"I always knew we're in a state of flux"** — Tense inconsistency. *“Knew”* (past) + *“we're”* (present) → should be *“we were”* to maintain past-tense narrative consistency.  
5. **"my technical expertise is... in some funny stack"** — *“Expertise”* is uncountable and singular, but *“is”* is correct; however, *“in some funny stack”* is vague and ungrammatical phrasing. More critically: *“expertise”* should be followed by *“lies in”* or *“is in”*, but *“is in some funny stack”* is awkward and imprecise. While not strictly ungrammatical, *“stack”* (a set of technologies) is countable, so *“a funny stack”* would be better—but the bigger issue is **semantic agreement**: *expertise* is abstract, *stack* is concrete; the phrasing conflates them awkwardly. (This counts as a **serious stylistic/grammatical mismatch**.)

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**  
1. **Inconsistent and inappropriate tone shifts**: The text moves from analytical/critical commentary to sarcastic asides (*“McKinsey Pichai”*, *“In America We Trust”*, *“we're still sane though, just unique circumstances”*), undermining credibility and coherence. The mock-serious tone (*“predatory capitalist attitude”*, *“golden goose”*) clashes with otherwise measured analysis.  
2. **Unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims presented as fact**: E.g., *“McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders”* — this is a loaded, unverified characterization (implying Pichai is a McKinsey puppet), which is both stylistically poor (ad hominem, conspiratorial) and potentially defamatory.  
3. **Overuse of hyperbolic, vague, or emotionally charged language**: *“ruthless capitalist engine”*, *“enshittification”* (a neologism, but used without definition), *“party’s gonna end”*, *“geographically misplaced”* — these are stylistically weak in formal or semi-formal analysis; they reduce persuasiveness and sound like opinionated rants rather than reasoned argument.  
4. **Inconsistent use of corporate naming conventions**: *“META and GOOG”* (using ticker symbols) vs. *“GOOG mainly”* vs. *“GOOG”* vs. *“META”* — mixing informal ticker usage with narrative prose is jarring. Standard style would use *“Meta”* and *“Google”* (or *“Alphabet”*, since GOOG is Alphabet’s ticker) in prose.  
5. **Self-referential, confessional tone undermines objectivity**: Phrases like *“people who know approximately how much I make”*, *“it’s obvious by now”*, *“I always knew”* — while relatable, they shift focus from the systemic analysis to personal narrative, weakening the argument’s authority. In analytical writing, such as confessional asides are stylistically inappropriate unless explicitly framed as personal reflection (which it isn’t).
