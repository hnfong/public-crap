Everybody called her Aspirin — she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

She didn’t mind the nickname. In fact, she wore it like a charm on a bracelet — light, tinkling, almost musical. Aspirin had long, dark hair that fell in soft waves down her back, and eyes the color of storm clouds just before they break. But it wasn’t her looks that earned her the name. It was the way she moved through the world — calm, deliberate, like a balm applied gently to a raw nerve.

She worked at the Willow Tree Café, tucked between a laundromat and a secondhand bookstore in the quietest corner of town. The café didn’t have Wi-Fi or avocado toast. It had mismatched mugs, a perpetually broken clock stuck at 4:17, and a playlist that cycled through Billie Holiday, Nick Drake, and the occasional Debussy nocturne. People came not for the coffee — though it was good — but for Aspirin.

She had a way of listening that made you feel like the only person in the room. Not performative empathy, not the kind of nodding that masks impatience, but real listening — the kind that made secrets spill like sugar from an overfilled bowl. A man once came in sobbing after losing his job, and she didn’t offer platitudes. She just sat across from him, poured him a second cup, and said, “Tell me about the first thing you ever built with your hands.” By the time he left, he was smiling, talking about a birdhouse he’d made at summer camp when he was nine.

Kids from the high school down the street would stop by after class, not for caffeine, but for her quiet wisdom. “Aspirin,” they’d say, “how do you stay so… unbothered?” And she’d smile, wipe the counter, and say, “I’m not unbothered. I’m just bothered in a way that doesn’t poison the air.”

But Aspirin wasn’t untouched by pain. Rumor had it she’d once been a concert pianist, that she’d studied in Vienna, played in grand halls across Europe. Then, one night, during a performance of Chopin’s Ballade No. 1, her hands froze mid-phrase. Doctors found nothing physically wrong. No stroke, no nerve damage. Just a silence that had settled into her fingers like frost. She never played publicly again.

Still, sometimes, late at night after closing, when the streetlights flickered on and the world softened into shadows, she’d sit at the old upright piano in the café’s back room and play — softly, slowly, like someone whispering a prayer. The notes would drift through the walls, fragile and beautiful, and if you were passing by, you might pause, not knowing why, and feel, just for a moment, that everything would be okay.

That was Aspirin’s gift. Not healing, exactly. But the quiet assurance that healing was possible.

And so, year after year, the people came — the broken, the weary, the quietly desperate — and left with lighter steps, clearer heads, and the faint echo of a melody they couldn’t quite place.

They called her Aspirin.

And the world, just a little, felt less painful. [end of text]
