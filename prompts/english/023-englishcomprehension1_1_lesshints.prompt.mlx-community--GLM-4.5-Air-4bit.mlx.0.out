==========
This passage was written on **April 1, 2023**. Here's how I arrived at this conclusion, making use of the hint about the "distinctive writing style" connected to a particular day and month:

### Key Clues from the Text:
1. **April Fools' Day Context**: The tone of the article is highly critical of Rust and overly enthusiastic about C++, which is unusual for someone deeply involved in the Rust community. This kind of dramatic, almost satirical critique—especially the exaggerated praise of C++ and dismissal of Rust's safety guarantees—aligns with the tradition of April Fools' pranks, where people write absurd or provocative content for humor.

2. **Specific References to C++ Features**: The article mentions C++26 features like "stackful coroutines" and "safe range-based for loops," which are either not finalized or not yet implemented in 2023. This suggests the author is either misinformed or intentionally exaggerating for comedic effect, which is common in April Fools' posts.

3. **Community Critique**: The portrayal of the Rust community as "extremely imperious" and the claim that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" (especially referencing the C++ subreddit's humor) is a gross oversimplification and likely a parody of real community dynamics. This kind of exaggerated contrast is typical of April Fools' content.

4. **Date-Specific Hint**: The hint mentions the "distinctive writing style" is connected to a particular day and month. April 1 (April Fools' Day) is the most logical fit, as the article's tone and content are consistent with a well-crafted prank. The author even invites discussion on Hacker News and /r/rust, which are common platforms for such pranks.

### Why Not Other Dates?
- The article references C++20 and C++26, which places it after C++20's standardization (2020) but before C++26's expected release (2023-2024). However, the exaggerated claims and satirical tone make it unlikely to be a serious critique from any other time.
- The mention of "cppfront" and the Carbon language (both real but niche projects) adds to the parody, as these are not mainstream enough to warrant such a dramatic shift in the article's tone.

### Conclusion:
The combination of the satirical tone, exaggerated claims, and the tradition of April Fools' pranks in tech communities strongly suggests this was written on **April 1, 2023**. The author likely intended to provoke discussion or humor by pretending to abandon Rust for C++, a common trope in programming language community debates. The hint about the "distinctive writing style" points directly to the absurdity typical of April Fools' content.
