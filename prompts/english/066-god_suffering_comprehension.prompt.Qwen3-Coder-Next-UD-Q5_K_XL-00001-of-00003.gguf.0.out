1. The main thesis is that God—understood not as a personal being but as the infinite, all-encompassing creative ground of all existence—permits suffering only because *we* subjectively choose to experience it; suffering and evil are not objective realities imposed from outside, but reflections of our own choices, beliefs, and perspectives within the totality of creation.

2. I find the argument philosophically intriguing but ultimately unconvincing as a full explanation of suffering: while subjective framing *does* shape our experience of pain, it risks minimizing real, systemic harm (e.g., genocide, famine) that victims did not choose—and that many cannot “rechoose” away without structural change. The view conflates *perception* of evil with its *ontological status*, which may offer comfort but not justice.

*The Tiger in the Doll*  
I made the tiger, fierce and tall—  
Not born of malice, but of all.  
I named the shadow, called it pain,  
Then claimed it ruled me, like a chain.  
But lo—I chose the doll’s soft gaze,  
And in that choice, the tiger fades.  
The world is shaped by what I see—  
Not what *is*, but what *I* be. [end of text]
