**The Cloudy Pillow**

On a crisp autumn morning, Emma woke up to the sound of rain tapping against the window. She groaned, rubbing her eyes, and rolled over to her side. The pillow beneath her felt cool and soft, but it wasn’t enough to distract her from the gloom in the room. She sighed, flipping to the other side of the pillow, only to notice something unusual.

A cloud had formed on the window, drifting lazily outside. It wasn’t just any cloud—it was a fluffy, cottony one, as if someone had gently tossed it into the sky. Emma stared at it, her heart fluttering. She had always loved clouds, but this one was different. It seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, as if it were alive, breathing, and laughing.

“Why does it look like that?” Emma whispered to herself, her voice barely audible over the rain. She reached out and touched the cloud, her fingers brushing against its surface. It felt warm and inviting, as if it were reaching out to her. For a moment, she forgot about her worries and simply lay back, letting the cloud drift above her.

As the days turned into weeks, the cloud became a part of Emma’s life. She would sit by the window each morning, watching it drift and change, marveling at its beauty. She would tell her little sister, Lily, about the cloud, exaggerating how it looked like a giant cotton candy cloud or a fluffy dragon. Lily would giggle and ask if she could see it, and Emma would smile, her heart full.

One day, Emma’s parents brought her a surprise. They had placed a pillow on her bed, covered in a soft, cloud-like blanket. “This is for you,” her father said, his eyes twinkling. “It’s like a cloud inside your pillow, ready to comfort you when you need it.”

Emma felt her cheeks heat up. She had always wanted a pillow that could make her feel like she was floating in the sky, but she never imagined it would come so naturally. She sat on the bed, her eyes closed, and let the cloud blanket drift over her. For the first time in a long while, she felt truly at peace.

From that day on, Emma began to cherish the simple things in life—the way the sun kissed her skin, the sound of birds chirping outside, and the warmth of a cloud drifting lazily through the sky. She learned that love wasn’t something grand or dramatic; it was just being present, being kind, and cherishing the small moments that made life beautiful.

And as Emma drifted off to sleep, she imagined the cloud above her, smiling at her like a friend.
