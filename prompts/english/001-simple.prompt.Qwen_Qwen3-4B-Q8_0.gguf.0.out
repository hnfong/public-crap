1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
   You would have to count up to **"one thousand"**. The first time the letter "A" appears in the English spelling of a number is in **"thousand"**. Before that, all numbers from one to nine hundred ninety-nine are spelled without the letter "A".

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**  
   The completed sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**  
   This sentence is famous for containing **every letter of the English alphabet** at least once, making it a common example used for testing typewriters, keyboards, and fonts.

3. **Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**  
   Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who built houses to keep the wolf away. The first pig built a house of straw, the second of sticks, and the third of bricks. The wolf tried to blow down the first two houses but failed, and the third pig was safe.

   One day, Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to visit her grandmother. She met the wolf, who tricked her into going to her grandmother's house. The wolf ate her, and when the pigs arrived, they found her grandmother missing and Little Red Riding Hood's body.

   The wolf tried to eat the pigs too, but the third pig, who had built a strong house of bricks, stood up and fought the wolf. The wolf was too strong, and the pigs managed to trap him in a trap. The wolf was finally caught, and the pigs were safe again.

   From that day on, the pigs always built their houses with the strongest materials, and Little Red Riding Hood learned to be careful who she trusted. [end of text]
