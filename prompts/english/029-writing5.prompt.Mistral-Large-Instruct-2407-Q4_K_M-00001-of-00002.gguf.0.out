In the bustling city of Hong Kong, there was a ordinary high school named St. Francis. Among the many students, there was one named Oliver. He was not like the others. He had a secret - he was a wood elf.

Oliver's family had moved from their forest home to the city for his father's job. They had to hide their true identity, so they used magic to make their pointed ears look round, and their green hair look black. Oliver found it hard to adjust to the city life. He missed the quiet and green of the forest. The concrete jungle was so different.

School life was not easy for Oliver. He was good at subjects like Biology and History, because elves have a deep understanding of nature and the past. But he struggled with subjects like Mathematics and Computer Science. Elves prefer the natural world over technology. He also found it hard to make friends. He was quiet and shy, and he couldn't join the others in activities like watching movies or playing video games, because his eyes were sensitive to screens.

One day, the school announced a camping trip. Oliver was excited. He loved the outdoors. During the trip, the students had to work in groups to set up tents and cook food. Oliver was in a group with three other students: Lucy, Jack, and Mei. They were all surprised by Oliver's skills. He could start a fire without a lighter, and he knew which plants were safe to eat.

On the last night of the trip, Oliver couldn't sleep. He went for a walk in the woods. He found a small, injured bird. Using his elf magic, he healed it. Lucy had followed him and saw everything. She was amazed.

"You're not human, are you?" she asked softly. Oliver hesitated, then shook his head. He trusted Lucy. He told her his secret. Lucy promised to keep it.

After the trip, Oliver and Lucy became best friends. She helped him with his studies, and he shared his knowledge of nature with her. Oliver's school life became much better. He realized that even in the city, he could find a way to connect with nature and make friends. He just had to be patient and true to himself.
