In the bustling city of Hong Kong, there is a ordinary high school named St. Francis. Among the many students there, one is not as ordinary as others. His name is Oliver, a quiet, polite boy with a secret. He is not human, but a wood elf.

Oliver lives in a small treehouse in the dense forest of Sai Kung, away from the city's noise. Every morning, he wakes up with the birds' singing, puts on his school uniform, and uses his elf magic to travel quickly to school. He loves school, loves learning about human world. His favorite subject is history, especially the history of China. He always scores high in tests, which makes his classmates admire him.

But Oliver is careful to hide his true identity. He knows humans are not ready to accept creatures like him. He wears a cap to cover his pointy ears, and never participates in sports to hide his supernatural agility. He always brings his own lunch, saying he is vegetarian, to avoid eating human food that makes him sick.

One day, the school announces a camping trip to Sai Kung. Oliver is excited but also worried. He knows the forest well, but he is afraid his classmates might discover his treehouse or see him using magic. He decides to go, hoping he can control the situation.

During the trip, they hike, cook over campfires, and tell stories. Oliver enjoys it very much. On the last day, a sudden storm comes. The students panic, but Oliver uses his magic secretly to guide them safely back to the camp. However, his classmate, Lily, sees him using magic.

Oliver is scared, but Lily smiles. "I knew you were different," she says, "Thank you for saving us." Oliver is surprised but relieved. He realizes not all humans fear the unknown. After the trip, they become best friends. Lily keeps his secret and helps him blend in better at school.

From then on, Oliver's school life becomes more enjoyable. He learns that friendship and trust can overcome differences. He is no longer just a wood elf hiding among humans, but a true student of St. Francis High School.
