1. **Main Thesis of the Text:**  
The text argues that all existence is a creation of God, who is not a person but a universal mechanism or law. We are subjective experiencers (with qualia) who choose our experiences, including suffering and evil. Therefore, suffering is not imposed on us but is a result of our own choices in perception and belief.

2. **Do I Agree?**  
I find the idea that we shape our experience compelling, but I disagree with the notion that all suffering is a personal choice. While perception and mindset influence experience, systemic and external factors also play a significant role in real-world suffering.

3. **Short Poem (Rhyming):**  
In realms where all is God's design,  
We craft our pain, our joy, our mind.  
Though life may bring a heavy toll,  
We shape the tale we choose to hold.  
Yet not all wounds are freely madeâ€”  
Some scars are carved by fate's cruel blade. [end of text]
