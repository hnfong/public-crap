## The Stone Collector

Old Man Tiber lived on the highest hill, in a house built of grey stone, and he collected stones. Not pretty, polished stones, mind you. Tiber collected *ordinary* stones. Smooth river rocks, jagged granite chunks, even bits of crumbling slate from broken roofs. His house wasn’t filled with furniture, but with piles and stacks of them, each carefully labelled with the date and location it was found.

The children of the village whispered he’d once been a great artist, renowned for sculpting beautiful things. But a heartbreak, they said, had turned him to stone himself, cold and unfeeling. They avoided his hill, convinced his touch would turn *them* to stone too.

Elara, however, wasn’t easily deterred. She was a small girl with a spirit as bright as a summer sky. Her grandmother, Nana Willow, had told her stories of Tiber, not of coldness, but of a man who saw beauty in everything. 

One day, Elara decided to bring Tiber a gift. Not a flower, not a sweet treat, but a story. She climbed the hill, clutching a worn, velvet **pillow** under her arm. 

She found him in his garden, meticulously arranging stones. He didn’t look up when she approached.

“Hello, Mr. Tiber,” she said, her voice small but clear.

He grunted.

“Nana Willow says you collect stones,” Elara continued, undeterred. “I brought you a story. It’s about a little **cloud** who was afraid to rain.”

Tiber finally glanced at her, his eyes grey and distant. “I collect stones, child. Not stories.”

Elara sat down on a flat rock, ignoring the prickle of discomfort. She began to tell her story, her voice animated. She described the cloud, how it worried its rain would wash away the flowers, how it feared being too much, too loud. She even **exaggerating** a little, adding a booming thunderclap and a rainbow that stretched across the entire world.

Tiber remained silent, but Elara noticed his hands had stopped moving. He was…listening.

When she finished, a long silence stretched between them. Finally, he spoke, his voice raspy. “That cloud…it sounds a lot like me.”

Elara’s eyes widened. “Really?”

“I used to build things, beautiful things. But then…then I lost someone I loved. I thought if I stopped creating, stopped *feeling*, I wouldn’t lose anything again. So I collected stones. Solid, unchanging things.”

He gestured to the piles surrounding them. “Safe things.”

Elara held out the pillow. “Nana Willow says sometimes, when you’re sad, you need something soft to lean on. Something to remind you it’s okay to feel.”

Tiber looked at the pillow, then at Elara. A flicker of something – warmth? – crossed his face. He took the pillow, his fingers tracing the worn velvet.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve held something soft,” he murmured.

Over the next few weeks, Elara visited Tiber often, sharing stories, drawing pictures, and simply sitting with him. She didn’t try to change him, just to be a friend. Slowly, she saw the grey in his eyes begin to soften. He started to arrange his stones not just by date, but by color, creating patterns that resembled flowers and birds. 

One day, he picked up a smooth, grey stone and began to carve. It wasn’t a grand sculpture, just a small, simple bird. But it was a start.

“I realized,” he said, looking at Elara with a genuine smile, “that even stones need a little love to show their true beauty. And so do people.”

Elara hugged him tightly. She understood now. Love wasn’t about avoiding pain, it was about opening your heart, even when it was scary. It was about sharing your stories, offering a soft pillow, and remembering that even the coldest stone could be warmed by a little kindness. And sometimes, that kindness was all it took to bring a little bit of sunshine back into the world.
