1. The text posits that suffering and evil are subjective experiences created by individuals through their choices and desires, rather than objective facts. It suggests that we create our own reality by choosing what and how to experience it, and that suffering and evil are not inherent but are a result of personal choices and desires.

2. I agree with the main thesis. The text effectively argues that suffering and evil are not universal or objective but are personal and subjective experiences created by our choices and desires. This perspective challenges the traditional view that suffering and evil are inherent or inevitable aspects of the world.

3. Here's a short poem based on the information above:

In the world, we choose our fate,
With every choice, we shape our fate.
Evil and suffering, they are not,
But choices made, by us, not by the lot.
We see what we want to see,
And what we don't, we don't see.
So let us choose to see the good,
And make our world a better room. [end of text]
