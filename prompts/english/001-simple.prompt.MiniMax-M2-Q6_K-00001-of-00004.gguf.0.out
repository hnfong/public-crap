### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter “A” in the English language spelling of a whole number?

**Answer: 1,000 (one thousand).**

**Explanation:**  
- The numbers from 1 to 999 are spelled without the letter “A” (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred, two hundred, etc.).  
- The word **“thousand”** in “one thousand” contains the letter “A.”  
- Therefore, you must count up to **1,000** before the letter “A” appears in the spelling of a whole number.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met Little Red Riding Hood.

**Title: The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**

Once upon a time, in a sunny meadow dotted with wildflowers, the three little pigs were busy building their homes. The first pig, who loved to take shortcuts, constructed a house of straw. The second pig, who preferred a balance of speed and comfort, built a house of sticks. The third pig, who valued safety above all else, worked tirelessly to build a sturdy house of bricks.

One crisp autumn morning, Little Red Riding Hood skipped through the meadow, her red cloak fluttering in the breeze. She carried a basket of treats for her grandmother, who lived in a cottage deep in the woods. As she walked, she heard the sound of hammering and cheerful whistling. Curious, she followed the noise and found the three pigs.

"Good morning!" called Little Red Riding Hood. "What are you building?"

"We're making our homes!" said the first pig, wiping sweat from his brow. "I’m almost done with my straw house!"

"And I’m finishing my stick house," added the second pig, hammering a stick into place.

The third pig, who was laying the last brick, smiled. "I’m building a brick house. It takes longer, but it will keep us safe."

Little Red Riding Hood admired their work. "How wonderful! I’m on my way to visit my grandmother. She lives in the woods nearby."

Just then, a shadow fell over the meadow. The big bad wolf, who had been lurking in the bushes, stepped into the clearing. His eyes gleamed as he saw the pigs and the little girl.

"Well, well," he growled. "A snack for me and a house to blow down!"

The wolf lunged at the straw house. With a mighty huff and a puff, he knocked it down in seconds. The first pig squealed and ran to his brother’s stick house. The wolf chased after them and, with another huff and a puff, the stick house collapsed too. Both pigs fled to the brick house, where their brother quickly barred the door.

Little Red Riding Hood, who had hidden behind a tree, watched in alarm. "Oh no! He’s after you!"

The wolf circled the brick house, huffing and puffing until his cheeks turned red, but the house stood firm. Frustrated, he noticed Little Red Riding Hood’s basket and caught her scent.

"Where are you going, little girl?" he snarled.

"To my grandmother’s house," she replied, trying to stay brave.

The wolf’s eyes lit up. He had a wicked idea. While the pigs were safe inside their brick house, the wolf ran ahead to Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother’s cottage. He knocked on the door.

"Grandmother, it’s me, Little Red Riding Hood!" he called in a sweet voice.

The kind grandmother opened the door, and the wolf pushed her inside, locking her safely in the pantry. Then he put on her nightgown and bonnet and waited in bed.

When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something odd. "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see you with, my dear," said the wolf.

"And what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear you with!"

"And what big teeth you have!"

"All the better to—" the wolf began, but before he could finish, the door burst open. The three little pigs, who had heard the commotion, had come to help. The third pig, strong and brave, wrestled the wolf while his brothers tied him up with rope.

The wolf, defeated and outsmarted, slunk away into the forest, promising never to bother anyone again.

Little Red Riding Hood hugged the pigs. "Thank you for saving my grandmother and me!"

The pigs smiled. "We’re glad we could help. And thank you for reminding us that working together makes us stronger."

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends. The pigs taught her how to build strong, safe homes, and she taught them the joy of sharing stories and treats. And they all lived happily ever after.
