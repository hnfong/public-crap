**"The Secret in the Bamboo Grove"**

My name is **Lok Yan**, but the elves call me **Sylvaris**—which means *"whisper of the forest"* in the old tongue. But in this school? I’m just another quiet Hong Kong student, wearing my school uniform, carrying my textbooks, and trying not to trip over my own feet when the teachers speak too fast in English.

But after the final bell rings? That’s when the real me comes out.

### **A Day Like Any Other (Or Not)**

Today was **Wednesday**, and I had **Chinese Literature** first period. The teacher, Mrs. Chan, was talking about *The Dream of the Red Chamber*—a book so boring even the air in the classroom felt asleep. I tried to focus, but my fingers kept twitching. The **bark of the old banyan tree** outside the window was calling to me.

*"Lok Yan… wake up."*

I blinked. The words weren’t in Cantonese. They were in **Sylvan**, the language of the forest, the one only the trees and I could hear.

*"The grove needs you,"* the tree whispered. *"The humans are cutting down the bamboo near the playground."*

My stomach twisted. The bamboo was **sacred** to us elves—it was our hiding place, our shelter, our **home**. If they chopped it down, we’d be exposed.

But how could I stop them? I wasn’t even supposed to be here. My parents—**the forest spirits**—had sent me to this human school to learn their ways, to blend in. *"You must be like them,"* my mother had said, *"but never forget what you are."*

So I sat quietly, pretending to take notes, while my mind raced.

### **Lunch Break: The Human World vs. The Hidden One**

At lunch, I sat with my friends—**Ho, Ming, and Kai**. They were laughing about some **K-pop idol’s new song**, and I forced a smile.

*"Lok Yan, you okay?"* Ho asked, nudging me. *"You’ve been quiet all morning."*

*"Just tired,"* I lied.

But my eyes kept darting toward the **bamboo grove** behind the school. That’s where the elves lived—**tiny, glowing creatures** with pointed ears and eyes like polished emeralds. They wove magic into the wind, made flowers bloom overnight, and kept the school’s **old jade statue** (which no one knew was actually a sleeping elf queen) safe from the rain.

If the humans found out…

I shivered.

### **The Plan (Or Lack Thereof)**

After school, I **sneaked away** during the "free study" period. The moment I stepped into the grove, the air hummed with energy. The elves **gasped** when they saw me.

*"Sylvaris! You’re back!"* **Pip**, a small elf with moss-green hair, fluttered down from a branch. *"The humans are coming with chainsaws!"*

My heart pounded. *"How many?"*

*"Too many,"* another elf, **Bramble**, muttered. *"We can’t fight them."*

I clenched my fists. Elves were **fast and stealthy**, but humans had **machines and fire**. We couldn’t win a direct fight.

Then I remembered something—**the old stories**. The forest spirits had once **tricked** humans into sparing the trees by making them **see illusions**. Maybe I could do the same.

### **The Trick of the Leaves**

That night, under the **half-moon**, I gathered the elves. *"We’ll make them think the bamboo is already gone,"* I whispered. *"We’ll weave an illusion—show them a forest where the bamboo has… disappeared."*

The elves exchanged glances. *"But what if they realize?"*

*"They won’t,"* I said. *"Humans see what they **expect** to see."*

So we worked through the night. The elves **spun magic** into the air, painting the grove with **shimmering mist**. When the workers arrived the next morning with their **loud machines**, they blinked in confusion.

*"Where’s the bamboo?"* one of them muttered.

*"Must’ve been a mistake,"* another said, scratching his head. *"Let’s just go."*

And just like that, the grove was saved.

### **The Secret Keeps**

The next day, I went back to school like nothing happened. Mrs. Chan was still talking about *The Dream of the Red Chamber*, and I pretended to listen.

But in my pocket, I carried a **single bamboo leaf**—a reminder of who I really was.

Sometimes, when the wind blew just right, I could hear the trees **whispering my name**.

And I smiled.

Because as long as the forest stood, **so did I**. [end of text]
