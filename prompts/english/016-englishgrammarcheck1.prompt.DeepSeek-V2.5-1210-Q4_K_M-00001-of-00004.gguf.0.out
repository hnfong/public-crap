5. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."**

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is overly informal and lacks precision. Consider rephrasing for clarity and formality.

2. **"And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is too long and convoluted. Consider breaking it into shorter sentences for readability.

3. **"In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is overly conversational and lacks formal tone. Consider rephrasing for a more professional style.

4. **"With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency"."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is overly verbose and uses unnecessary quotation marks around "high" and "efficiency." Consider simplifying and removing the quotation marks.

5. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is overly casual and uses slang ("gonna"). Consider rephrasing for a more formal tone.

   - Issue: The parenthetical "(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)" is awkwardly placed and interrupts the flow of the sentence. Consider rephrasing or moving it.

2. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."**  
   - Issue: The sentence is overly long and contains multiple ideas. Consider breaking it into shorter sentences for clarity.

3. **"And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."**  
   - Issue: The parenthetical "(GOOG mainly)" is awkwardly placed and interrupts the flow. Consider rephrasing or moving it.

4. **"In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this
