**The Symphony of the Unseen**  

In the quiet hum of a city that never sleeps, there exists a symphony no one hears. It is not composed of violins or drums but of the rustle of leaves in a forgotten alley, the echo of footsteps on rain-slicked pavement, the sigh of a train passing through a tunnel. This is the music of the unseen—unheard by most, yet alive in the spaces between moments.  

I once wandered into a library where the air smelled of dust and possibility. The shelves stretched like ancient trees, their branches heavy with stories. A librarian, her eyes like polished obsidian, handed me a book bound in leather that pulsed faintly, as if breathing. When I opened it, the words rearranged themselves, forming a melody I had never heard but somehow knew by heart. It was a lullaby from a childhood I’d never lived, yet it cradled me like a memory.  

The library was a portal. It whispered secrets to those who listened—not with their ears, but with their bones. I learned that the world is a mosaic of such symphonies: the creak of a door in a house long abandoned, the laughter of a child who never existed, the static of a radio tuned to a frequency only the lost can hear. These are the notes of the unseen, the harmonies that bind us to the infinite.  

But why do we ignore them? Perhaps because the unseen is too vast, too fragile, too beautiful to be tamed by our need for control. We chase the loud, the visible, the familiar, while the quiet symphony slips through our fingers like sand.  

Yet, if we pause, if we lean in, we might hear it. A heartbeat in the rustle of a curtain, a sigh in the wind, a story waiting to be read. The unseen is not silent—it is waiting. And sometimes, it is us who must learn to listen.
