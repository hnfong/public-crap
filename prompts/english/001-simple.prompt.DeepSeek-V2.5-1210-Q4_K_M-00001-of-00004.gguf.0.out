### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Once upon a time, the three little pigs were building their houses—one of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks. One day, as they were working, they heard a knock at their door. It was Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother.

The pigs greeted her warmly and invited her in. Little Red Riding Hood admired their houses and asked why they were building them. The first pig explained, "We’re building strong homes to protect ourselves from the big bad wolf!"

Little Red Riding Hood gasped. "The big bad wolf? I’m on my way to visit my grandmother, and I’m worried he might be nearby."

The third little pig, who had built the brick house, said, "Don’t worry, Little Red Riding Hood. You can stay with us until you feel safe. Our brick house is the strongest!"

Just then, they heard a loud howl outside. The big bad wolf had arrived, demanding that the pigs come out. Little Red Riding Hood and the pigs stayed calm and stayed inside the brick house. The wolf huffed and puffed, but the brick house stood strong.

Frustrated, the wolf tried to trick Little Red Riding Hood by disguising himself as her grandmother. But the pigs saw through his disguise and shouted, "Your ears are too big, and your nose is too long!"

The wolf fled, and Little Red Riding Hood thanked the pigs for their help. She continued on her journey, feeling much safer knowing the pigs were there to protect her. From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends.
