1. The main thesis of the text is that God is the infinite creator of all existence and embodies a universal principle of nurturing all creation, not human-like emotion. Humans are vessels for experiencing this creation through subjective consciousness, or "qualia," and all experiences—including suffering and evil—are ultimately chosen by the individual as part of their perspective. The perception of suffering is not an objective truth but a personal, subjective choice shaped by belief and awareness.

2. I disagree. While the idea that perspective shapes experience has philosophical merit, equating systemic suffering and evil to mere personal choice minimizes real human pain and ignores structural injustices. Suffering is not always a choice—many endure it through circumstances beyond their control, which challenges the notion that we freely select our experiences.

3.  

In God’s vast weave, all things unfold,  
A tapestry no hand can hold.  
We taste the light, we taste the night—  
Each shade a choice, each pain, a sight.  

The world we see, we help compose,  
Through love, through loss, through all that grows.  
Yet not all wounds are freely known—  
Some seeds of hurt are not our own.  

Still, in the dark, a step we make,  
To shift the dream, for kindness’ sake.  
For though we choose how to believe,  
Compassion’s truth is what we cleave. [end of text]
