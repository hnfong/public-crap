We have a puzzle. Let's parse the description.

"There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block."

Interpretation: There is a stack of blocks. At the top, there are three black blocks stacked on top of each other. Beneath them (i.e., below the three black blocks) there is a blue block. So the stack from top to bottom is: black, black, black, blue. Then there is an unknown block (the "block we don't know the color of") somewhere? The phrase "on top of an block that we don't know the color of" suggests that the three black blocks are on top of an unknown block. So the unknown block is below the three black blocks. Then "beneath them there is a blue block." Wait, that seems contradictory: if the unknown block is below the three black blocks, then the blue block is beneath the unknown block? Or is the blue block beneath the three black blocks? Let's parse: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." The phrase "beneath them" refers to the three black blocks. So the blue block is beneath the three black blocks. So the unknown block is above the blue block? Or is the unknown block the same as the blue block? Let's think.

We have a stack: top: three black blocks. Then below them: unknown block (color unknown). Then below that: blue block. So the unknown block is between the black blocks and the blue block. So the unknown block is not the blue block. So we have a stack: black, black, black, unknown, blue. Or maybe the unknown block is the same as the blue block? But the phrase "beneath them there is a blue block" suggests that the blue block is separate from the unknown block. So unknown block is distinct.

Thus we have a stack of 5 blocks: top three black, then unknown (color unknown), then blue at bottom.

Now we remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. So we take all blocks (the three black, the unknown, the blue) and add a green block, making total of 5 blocks (since we added one green). Then we shuffle them (random order). Then we put them back on top of each other (i.e., we stack them again). The phrase "put them back on top of each other" suggests we stack them in some order (maybe random). The question: "The yellow block is on top of blue block." So after shuffling and stacking, the topmost block is yellow. The bottom block is blue (since we know the blue block is at the bottom after stacking). So the top block is yellow. The question: "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" So we need to deduce the color of the unknown block given that the top block is yellow.

We need to consider the possible colors of the unknown block. The known colors: black (three), blue (one), green (one). The unknown block could be any of these colors? Or could be a new color? The puzzle likely expects that the unknown block is one of the colors we have: black, blue, green, or maybe yellow? But we have a yellow block on top, which is not among the known colors. So the unknown block could be yellow? Or maybe the unknown block is the yellow block? Let's think.

We have a set of blocks: three black, one blue, one green, and one unknown (color unknown). After shuffling, we stack them. The top block is yellow. So the unknown block could be yellow, or maybe the unknown block is not present? But we have a known yellow block somewhere else? The puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." So there is a yellow block somewhere in the stack, on top of the blue block. The unknown block is somewhere else in the stack. The question: "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" So we need to deduce the color of the unknown block based on the fact that the top block is yellow.

We need to consider the constraints: The unknown block is one of the blocks we have (the three black, the blue, the green, and the unknown). The unknown block's color is unknown initially, but we have some constraints from the final arrangement.

We need to consider the possible permutations of the blocks after shuffling. The unknown block could be any of the colors: black, blue, green, or maybe yellow (if the unknown block is the yellow block). But we need to see if any constraints rule out some possibilities.

Let's denote the blocks: B1, B2, B3 (black), U (unknown), G (green), Y (yellow). The unknown block is U. The known colors: B (black), G (green), Y (yellow). The unknown block could be any of these colors, but we don't know which. The puzzle says "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So the unknown block is not black (since there are three black blocks on top of it). So the unknown block is not black. It could be blue, green, or yellow. But we also have a blue block beneath the unknown block? Wait, the phrase "beneath them there is a blue block." The unknown block is beneath the three black blocks, and the blue block is beneath the unknown block. So the unknown block is above the blue block. So the unknown block cannot be blue because the blue block is below it. So unknown block cannot be blue. So unknown block is either green or yellow.

Now we have a green block present (the green block is one of the blocks). The unknown block could be green or yellow. But we also have a yellow block on top of the blue block after stacking. So the yellow block is somewhere in the stack, above the blue block. The unknown block is somewhere else in the stack, possibly above or below the yellow block? Let's think.

We have a stack after shuffling: some order of the five blocks (B, B, B, U, G). The top block is Y (yellow). The bottom block is B (blue). So the stack from top to bottom is: Y, ..., ..., ..., B (blue). The unknown block U is somewhere in the middle. The three black blocks are also somewhere in the stack, but we know they are not on top of the unknown block? Actually, the original description: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So originally, the three black blocks were on top of the unknown block, and the blue block was beneath the unknown block. So originally, the order was: black, black, black, unknown, blue. After shuffling, we have a random order of these five blocks. The top block is Y (yellow). So the unknown block could be anywhere in the stack, but we know the blue block is at the bottom (since it's the only block that is known to be at the bottom). The unknown block could be above or below the yellow block? Let's think.

We have the following blocks: B (black), B (black), B (black), U (unknown), G (green). The unknown block is not black, not blue (since blue is below it). So unknown block is either green or yellow. But we have a green block present, and a yellow block present. The unknown block could be green or yellow. But we need to determine which.

We have the final arrangement: top is Y, bottom is B. The unknown block is somewhere in the middle. The three black blocks are also somewhere in the middle. The green block is also somewhere in the middle.

We need to deduce the color of the unknown block. The only constraints are: unknown block is not black, not blue, and not green? Actually, unknown block could be green or yellow. But we have a green block present, and a yellow block present. The unknown block could be green or yellow. But we need to see if any arrangement is possible that satisfies the constraints.

Let's enumerate possible permutations of the five blocks (B, B, B, U, G) with the condition that the top is Y and bottom is B. But we need to consider that Y is not among the original blocks; it's a new block that appears on top after shuffling. Wait, the puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." So after shuffling, the top block is yellow. But we didn't have a yellow block originally. So the yellow block must be the unknown block? Or maybe the unknown block is yellow, and the green block is somewhere else. But we have a green block present, which is not used in the final arrangement? Actually, the puzzle says "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other." So we have the original blocks (three black, unknown, blue) plus an additional green block. So we have total of 5 blocks: three black, unknown, blue, green. Then we shuffle them and stack them. The top block is yellow. So the yellow block must be one of the blocks we have. But we didn't have a yellow block originally. So the unknown block must be yellow. Because the only block we don't know the color of is the unknown block. So the unknown block must be yellow. But we need to verify if that is consistent with the constraints.

Let's examine: The unknown block is the only block whose color we don't know. The puzzle says "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So the unknown block is not black, not blue. It could be green or yellow. But we have a green block present (the additional green block). So the unknown block could be green or yellow. But we also have a yellow block on top after shuffling. The unknown block could be yellow, but then the green block would be somewhere else. But we need to see if any arrangement can have the unknown block be green and still have a yellow block on top.

Let's consider the possibility that the unknown block is green. Then the green block is the unknown block. The other blocks are three black, blue, and the green (unknown). The green block is unknown color, but we
