Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Based on the scenario provided, it seems that Bob ate a meal that Alice found unappetizing or unhealthful. The meal described by Bob includes aged organic milk, tomato purée, and whole wheat bread. However, the description is quite unusual and not typically how one would prepare such ingredients.

Here’s a breakdown of what happened:

1. **Aged Organic Milk**: This is not a typical way to consume milk. Usually, milk is consumed fresh or in a variety of prepared forms like yogurt or cheese. Aged milk might be used in certain dishes, but it's not a common or healthy preparation.

2. **Tomato Purée**: This is a condiment made from tomatoes, often used in sauces or as a topping. It can be healthy if made from fresh tomatoes, but the description suggests it might be in a less conventional form.

3. **Baked Whole Wheat Bread**: This is a healthy choice, as whole wheat bread is generally more nutritious than refined white bread.

4. **Seasoned**: The use of "seasoned" suggests that the ingredients were prepared with additional flavors, which could be either healthy or unhealthy depending on the seasonings used.

Alice's reaction, "wtf," indicates that the meal was not what she expected or found appealing. The unusual combination of aged milk and tomato purée, especially when described in such a manner, likely surprised Alice.

In summary, while some of the ingredients (like whole wheat bread) are healthy, the combination and preparation of the aged organic milk and tomato purée seem to be unconventional and unappetizing to Alice. Therefore, the meal was not healthy in the conventional sense, and Alice found it strange or unappetizing. [end of text]
