1. You would have to count up to the number "one thousand" before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The word "thousand" is the first number that contains the letter "A" in its spelling.

2. The sentence is completed as follows: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is often used as a typing exercise to practice using all the keys on a keyboard.

3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs met Little Red Riding Hood in the forest. They were surprised to see her, as they had never met before. Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to visit her grandmother, and the pigs were busy building their houses.

The first little pig was building his house out of straw, the second little pig was building his house out of sticks, and the third little pig was building his house out of bricks. Little Red Riding Hood was impressed by the third little pig's hard work and determination.

As they were talking, they heard a loud growl coming from the bushes. It was the Big Bad Wolf! The wolf had been stalking Little Red Riding Hood and was now ready to pounce. The three little pigs quickly ushered Little Red Riding Hood into the brick house, which was the strongest and safest.

The wolf tried to blow down the brick house, but it was too strong. The pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were safe inside, and they came up with a plan to outsmart the wolf. They lured him away from the house with a trail of breadcrumbs, and then they chased him away with pots and pans.

In the end, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became great friends, and they all lived happily ever after. The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help you overcome any obstacle, and that teamwork can help you achieve great things. [end of text]
