Okay, let’s break down this text and address your questions.

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering and evil are not inherent to the world but are primarily a product of individual subjective experience and choice. It posits that we are vessels for experiencing God’s creation, and our individual interpretations of reality – including our desires and reactions to suffering – shape our perception of the world. Essentially, the text suggests that suffering isn’t a universal truth but a deeply personal and often difficult experience.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

Yes, I largely agree with the core argument. The text powerfully highlights the subjective nature of experience and how our choices and interpretations influence how we perceive the world, including suffering. It’s a compelling perspective that challenges the idea of a purely objective, “natural” explanation for suffering.  While acknowledging the existence of suffering, it emphasizes that it’s a product of individual consciousness.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

Here’s a short poem inspired by the text:

“The world spins, a shadowed hue,
With suffering, both old and new.
A choice we make, a heart’s decree,
To feel the pain, for you and me.”
