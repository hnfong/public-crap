So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Alright, I need to review the provided text and identify any grammar mistakes, especially focusing on tense and agreement issues, as well as serious stylistic problems. Let's start by reading through the text carefully to get a general sense of its content and structure.

First, I notice that the text discusses a running story about Andreessen Horowitz's critique of big tech companies, suggesting that these companies aren't doing enough "real work" to justify their existence. The author then delves into their personal analysis of tech stocks, particularly META and GOOG, considering factors like monopolistic practices and the potential for profit maximization through layoffs. There's also a discussion on the broader implications of capitalist attitudes in the tech industry, including regulatory concerns and the impact of interest rates on financial efficiency.

As I read, I'm keeping an eye out for any grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, or awkward phrasing that could hinder readability. I'm also looking for stylistic issues that might affect the overall flow or clarity of the text.

One thing that catches my attention is the use of "there's a running story" followed by "basically saying." This phrasing seems a bit disjointed. Perhaps it would be clearer to say, "There's a running story that Andreessen Horowitz is basically saying that people in big tech companies aren't doing enough real work to justify their existence."

Moving on, the author mentions "unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers," which is a strong statement. I wonder if this is the most accurate way to phrase it, or if a softer term might be more appropriate to maintain objectivity.

In the section discussing tech stocks, the author refers to "META and GOOG," which is correct, but later uses "GOOG" and "GOOGL." This inconsistency in the abbreviation of Google's stock symbol could confuse readers.

Another point of confusion is the mention of "layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit." The use of "layoff more people" is grammatically correct, but the subsequent clauses "increase margins and profit" could be clearer. Perhaps rephrasing it to "increase margins and profits" would enhance readability.

The author also states, "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." The phrase "no ounce of doubt" is a bit archaic and might not be the most effective way to convey certainty. A more contemporary expression could strengthen the statement.

In discussing the impact of interest rates and regulatory concerns, the author writes, "With promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." The parenthetical statement about AI seems a bit disconnected from the main clause. Perhaps integrating it more seamlessly would improve clarity.

The final paragraph touches on personal financial planning and the challenges faced in the tech industry. The author mentions "saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity," which is a strong statement. However, the transition from discussing the broader industry to personal financial concerns feels abrupt and might benefit from a smoother connection.

Overall, while the text is well-structured and conveys its message effectively, there are several areas where grammatical clarity and stylistic flow could be enhanced to improve readability and impact.

1. **Grammar Mistakes:**
   - *Tense Agreement:* "there's a running story" followed by "basically saying" feels disjointed. It would be better to say, "There's a running story that Andreessen Horowitz is basically saying that people in big tech companies aren't doing enough real work to justify their existence."
   - *Subject-Verb Agreement:* "unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" uses "assault" as a noun, which doesn't agree with the intended meaning. It should be "unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers."
   - *Consistency in Abbreviations:* The stock symbol for Google is inconsistently abbreviated as "GOOG" and "GOOGL," which can confuse readers.
   - *Clarity in Phrases:* "increase margins and profit" is grammatically correct but could be clearer as "increase margins and profits."
   - *Stylistic Phrases:* "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" uses an archaic phrase "no ounce of doubt," which could be replaced with "no doubt at all" for better clarity.

2. **Stylistic Issues:**
   - *Disconnected Parenthetical Statements:* The mention of "small pockets of AI" feels disconnected from the main clause about revolutionary tech. It would be better integrated into the sentence.
   - *Abrupt Transition:* Moving from discussing the broader industry to personal financial concerns feels abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.
   - *Word Choice:* Phrases like "ruthless capitalist engine" are strong but could be more precise. Perhaps "capitalist-driven mechanisms" would be clearer.
   - *Passive Voice Usage:* The text uses passive constructions frequently, which can make the writing less engaging. Active voice could enhance readability.
   - *Repetitive Phrasing:* The use of "layoff more people" and "cut costs" is repetitive. Varying the expressions could improve flow.

3. **Other Problems:**
   - *Incomplete Sentences:* Some sentences, like "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude," are run-on and could be split into two sentences for clarity.
   - *Lack of Transitions:* The flow between paragraphs could be smoother with better transitional phrases to guide the reader through the argument.
   - *Overuse of Parentheses:* Excessive use of parentheses can disrupt the reading flow and make the text feel cluttered.
   - *Informal Language:* Phrases like "the party's gonna end sooner or later" are informal and may not align with the professional tone of the rest of the text.
   - *Technical Jargon:* Terms like "FI" (Financial Independence) are used without explanation, which might be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the concept.
