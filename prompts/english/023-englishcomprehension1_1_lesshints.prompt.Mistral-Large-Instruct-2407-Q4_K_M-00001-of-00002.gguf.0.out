[INST] Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the writing style which is strongly connected to a particular day and month. Explain your rationale. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.
[/INST] 1. **April Fools' Day (April 1, 2023)**: The passage has several indicators that suggest it might be a satirical piece written for April Fools' Day. Here are some reasons:

   - **Exaggerated Claims**: The author makes exaggerated claims about the superiority of C++ over Rust, which is a common theme in satirical pieces. For example, the author claims that memory safety issues are "overblown" and that they can avoid writing code with safety problems because they are a good programmer.

   - **Unrealistic Comparisons**: The author compares Rust's safety features to C++ and claims that C++ is evolving to become safer, which is a contentious topic in the programming community. They also mention that C++26 will have features like stackful coroutines and the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, which are not real features planned for C++26.

   - **Community Criticism**: The author criticizes the Rust community for being "imperious" and demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and praises the C++ community for being "nicer and friendlier." This is a common trope in satirical pieces that poke fun at programming language communities.

   - **Mention of cppfront and Carbon**: The author mentions Herb Sutter's cppfront and the new C++ compatible Carbon language, which are real projects but are mentioned in a way that suggests they are being used to exaggerate the superiority of C++.

   - **Code of Conduct**: The author criticizes Rust's code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity, which is a sensitive topic in the programming community and is often used in satirical pieces to generate controversy.

   - **Call to Action**: The author ends the passage with a call to action to join their Zulip instance to help with the C++ rewrite, which is a common way to end satirical pieces.

   - **Discussion Links**: The author includes links to discuss the passage on Hacker News and /r/rust, which is a common way to generate discussion and engagement with satirical pieces.

Given these indicators, it is likely that this passage was written for April Fools' Day to poke fun at the programming language community and generate discussion. The specific date of April 1, 2023, is a guess based on the fact that the passage mentions C++26, which suggests that it was written after the release of C++23.
