 The distinctive writing style and the specific mention of "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" suggest that this passage is written in the style of an April Fools' Day joke. The author's exaggerated criticisms of Rust and overly optimistic views of C++, along with the humorous tone, are typical of the kind of satirical content often posted on April 1st.

Therefore, my best guess is that this passage was written on **April 1st**. The hint lies in the satirical and exaggerated tone, which is a common characteristic of April Fools' Day content. [end of text]
