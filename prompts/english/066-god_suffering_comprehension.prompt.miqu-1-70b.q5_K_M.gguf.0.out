 1. The main thesis of the text is that God, as the creator of everything, nurtures and supports all creations without human-like emotions. Humans are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and subjective experiences, including suffering and evil, are personal choices. The text argues that people choose their experiences and have agency to change them.

2. I partially agree with the text. While it is true that perception and mindset can greatly influence one's experience of reality, it is not accurate to claim that all suffering and evil are solely subjective choices. There are objective realities of pain, injustice, and systemic issues that individuals may not have chosen and cannot simply will away.

3. In God's vast tapestry, woven so wide,
A dance of life, where joys and sorrows reside,
We choose our path, and in our stride,
Shape our own world, with will as our guide.

Through suffering's grip, or evil's cold hand,
We find our strength, and in unity, we stand,
For choice is ours, to make or withstand,
In this grand play, directed by an unseen hand.

Embrace the journey, both dark and bright,
In innocence or knowledge, find your light,
In every choice, we ignite our sight,
As vessels of experience, in God's eternal night. [end of text]
