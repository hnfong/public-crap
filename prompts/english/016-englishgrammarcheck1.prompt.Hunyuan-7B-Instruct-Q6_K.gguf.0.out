### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)
1. **"And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault..."**  
   - **Issue:** Subject-verb agreement error. "Seem" should agree with the plural subject "this," so it should be "seem to an unwarranted assault."

2. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Agree" should agree with the singular subject "I," so it should be "I agree that he's probably onto something."

3. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Logic" is singular, so "line of logic" should be "line of logic" (singular). However, "line of logic" is a singular concept, so the sentence is grammatically correct. This is not an error.

4. **"they can always layoff more people..."**  
   - **Issue:** Subject-verb agreement error. "They" is plural, so "layoff" should be "layoffs."

5. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "I" is singular, so "had no ounce of doubt" is correct, but the clause "that they can cut costs" uses "they," which is plural. This creates a subject-verb agreement mismatch within the clause.

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. **"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance."**  
   - **Issue:** Repetition and lack of clarity. The phrase "True Abundance" feels redundant and unclear. Consider rephrasing for better impact.

2. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years..."**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. The phrase "have a reasonable expectation what" is unnatural. Consider rephrasing to "have a reasonable expectation that their careers would look like."

3. **"I always knew we're in a state of flux."**  
   - **Issue:** Overuse of "we." The author is speaking individually, so "we" feels out of place. Consider rephrasing to "I always knew we were in a state of flux."

4. **"there's actually no tech jobs here"**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. The phrase "there's actually no" is unnatural. Consider rephrasing to "there are actually no tech jobs here."

5. **"in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses"**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Funny stack" is unclear and informal. Consider rephrasing to "some niche stack" or "a specialized stack."

### Other Problems
1. **"And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal tone. The phrase "pleases the shareholders" feels overly casual and unprofessional.

2. **"With promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)"**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Largely gone" and "operationally much smaller" are informal and could be rephrased for clarity and formality.

3. **"This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)"**  
   - **Issue:** Informal language. "Great/shitty" is informal and could be rephrased to "subpar" or "inferior."

4. **"With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away..."**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Held 'high'" is informal and could be rephrased to "remain high" or "stay elevated."

5. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal tone. "I mean" is overly casual and could be removed for a more professional tone.
