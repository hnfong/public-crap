### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)
1. **"While this might seem to an unwarranted assault..."**  
   - **Issue:** Subject-verb agreement error. "Seem" should be followed by "an" because "an" is used before vowel sounds.  
   - **Correction:** "While this might seem to be an unwarranted assault..."

2. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Agree" should agree with the plural subject "he's" (he is/are).  
   - **Correction:** "I can't help but agree that he is probably onto something..."

3. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Logic" is singular, so "line" should be singular.  
   - **Correction:** "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic."

4. **"they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Monopolies" is plural, so "profit" should be plural.  
   - **Correction:** "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profits from the monopolies..."

5. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs..."**  
   - **Issue:** Agreement error. "Doubt" is singular, so "they" should be singular.  
   - **Correction:** "I had no ounce of doubt that he can cut costs..."

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. **"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance."**  
   - **Issue:** Repetition of "Abundance" creates redundancy.  
   - **Correction:** "True abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't the same as true abundance."

2. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..."**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Expectation what" is unnatural.  
   - **Correction:** "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like..."

3. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal tone ("I mean") disrupts the formal tone of the text.  
   - **Correction:** Remove "I mean" or rephrase to maintain formality.

4. **"it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal language ("it's obvious," "gonna") detracts from the formal tone.  
   - **Correction:** "It is now obvious that the party will eventually end."

5. **"we're still sane though, just unique circumstances."**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Unique circumstances" is unclear and informal.  
   - **Correction:** "We are still sane, albeit under unique circumstances."

### Other Problems
1. **"And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal tone ("pleases the shareholders") and unclear reference to "McKinsey Pichai."  
   - **Correction:** "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is undoubtedly ready to do whatever the shareholders demand."

2. **"This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal language ("shitty") and unclear phrasing.  
   - **Correction:** "This inevitably involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e., these jobs will be as great as any random gig in the general job market)."

3. **"With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal language ("held 'high,'," "largely gone," "operationally much smaller") and unclear phrasing.  
   - **Correction:** "With interest rates still maintained at 'high,' the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely unmet (besides small pockets of AI, which are currently operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency.'"

4. **"Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another."**  
   - **Issue:** Awkward phrasing. "Those who read history knows" is incorrect.  
   - **Correction:** "Those who read history know -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another."

5. **"I always knew we're in a state of flux. Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)."**  
   - **Issue:** Informal language
