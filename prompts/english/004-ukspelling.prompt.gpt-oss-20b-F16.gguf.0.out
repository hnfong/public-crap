<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to write a short story of less than 200 words describing the rainbows the writer likes the most. Use UK English, simple words. It's a short story for UK children. So we need to keep it under 200 words. Let's aim for about 150 words. Use simple words, UK spelling. The story should describe the rainbows that the writer likes the most. So maybe the writer has a favourite rainbow that appears after a storm, or a rainbow that appears in a particular place. The story should be engaging for children. Use simple language. Use UK English: "colour" instead of "color", "favourite" instead of "favorite". Keep it under 200 words. Let's write about a child who loves rainbows, especially the one that appears in the garden after a rainstorm. The story can be about a child named Lily who loves the rainbow that appears in the garden, with bright colours, and she imagines it as a bridge to a magical land. The story can describe the rainbow's colours, how it looks, and why it's favourite. Use simple words. Let's keep it under 200 words. Let's aim for 140-160 words. Let's write.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>When the clouds part after a long rain, Lily rushes outside with her bright red umbrella. The sky is a clear blue, and a rainbow arches across it, just like a giant, colourful bow. Lilyâ€™s favourite rainbow is the one that appears in her garden. It is not the tallest, but it is the most vivid. The colours are bright: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. They shine like a rainbow of fireflies.

She thinks the rainbow is a bridge to a secret garden. She imagines stepping onto the rainbow and finding a field of flowers that sing. The rainbow feels warm, like a hug from the sun. Lily loves the way the colours blend together, like a painting that moves. Every time she sees that rainbow, she feels happy and brave. It reminds her that after every storm, there is a bright, beautiful promise in the sky. [end of text]
