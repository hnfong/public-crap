When the sky is grey, I sit by the window and wait. The clouds roll in, and the wind whistles. Then, a bright line of colour appears. It is a rainbow, and it is my favourite.

I love the rainbow that starts at the left side of the window and stretches all the way to the right. It has seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The red is bright like a stopâ€‘light. The orange is warm, like a sunny apple. The yellow is bright, like a school bus. The green is fresh, like the grass outside. The blue is deep, like the sea. The indigo is dark, like a night sky. The violet is soft, like a flower petal.

I imagine the rainbow is a bridge that takes me to a land of sweets and stories. I close my eyes and feel the colours dancing. That rainbow makes me smile, and I know that every time it appears, a new adventure is waiting. [end of text]
