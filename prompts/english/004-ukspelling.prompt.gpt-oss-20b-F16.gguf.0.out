The sky is still a little grey, but then a line of colours appears, like a giant smile in the clouds. I love the rainbow that starts at the edge of the playground and stretches all the way to the old oak tree. It is the longest one I have ever seen, and it feels like a bridge made of light.

The first colour is red, bright as a stopâ€‘sign. Next comes orange, warm like a sunny apple. Yellow follows, bright as a school bus. Green is next, soft as the grass. Blue is deep, like the sea. Indigo is a little shy, and violet is the last, soft as a lavender flower.

I stand there, hand on my heart, and think of all the stories the rainbow could tell. It reminds me that after every storm, there is a promise of colour and hope. And that is why I love the rainbow the most. [end of text]
