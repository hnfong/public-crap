Rainbows are my favourite thing in the sky.  

One summer morning, I was walking to school with my dog, Pip. The clouds were thick and grey, but then—*pop*—a rainbow appeared! It wasn’t just one colour. It had red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Like a bridge made of light.  

I stopped and watched. Pip wagged his tail. “Look, Pip,” I said. “It’s like a rainbow cake!”  

The rainbow curved over the garden, then dipped down to the pond. A frog jumped out. “A rainbow for the frogs too?” I laughed.  

Later, I saw another one. This one was shorter, like a smile. It sparkled in the sun, and I thought, *This one is happy*.  

I like rainbows that are not too long. I like the ones that look like a smile or a wave. They make me feel warm, even when it’s cold outside.  

Rainbows don’t last long. But every time I see one, I remember: magic is in the sky. And sometimes, it just needs a little rain to show up.  

I’ll always look for them. Even if the clouds stay grey.  

Because a rainbow is not just a colour. It’s a promise.  

That’s the one I like the most. [end of text]
