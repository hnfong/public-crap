The passage was written on **April 1st**.

### Explanation:
The hint about the "distinctive writing style" and the connection to a particular day and month suggests that this passage is an **April Fools' Day joke**. The tone, content, and arguments presented in the passage are deliberately exaggerated and satirical, which is a common style for April Fools' Day pranks. Here are the key indicators:

1. **Over-the-top praise for C++**: The author claims to be "pining" for C++ despite its well-known complexities and safety issues, which is a tongue-in-cheek reversal of the typical Rust vs. C++ debate. The exaggerated enthusiasm for C++ features like "stackful coroutines" and "embedding binary file contents" further underscores the humor.

2. **Mocking the Rust community**: The author portrays the Rust community as "imperious" and overly focused on diversity policies, which is a caricature of common perceptions but presented in a way that is clearly meant to be humorous.

3. **References to upcoming C++ features**: The mention of "C++26" features and Herb Sutter's "cppfront" proposal, which are speculative or hypothetical at best, adds to the absurdity.

4. **Community and social commentary**: The author's comments about the C++ community being "nicer and friendlier" and the Rust community being "imperious" are exaggerated stereotypes designed to provoke a laugh.

5. **Conclusion and call for help**: The call to "join our Zulip instance" and the mention of "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" are typical of April Fools' Day pranks, which often end with a playful call to action.

Given the satirical tone, the exaggerated arguments, and the timing of April Fools' Day, it's clear that this passage was written on April 1st as a humorous take on the Rust vs. C++ debate. [end of text]
