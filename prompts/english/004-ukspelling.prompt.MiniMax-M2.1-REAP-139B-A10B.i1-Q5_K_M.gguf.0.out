**The Rainbow I Like Best**

The rainbow I like best is the one that appears after a summer storm. When the grey clouds drift away and the sun shines through the falling drops, the colours stretch across the wet sky.

First comes red, bright as a tomato. Then orange follows, like a tangeron. Yellow comes next, as warm as a gold coin. Green appears, soft as grass. Blue stretches out, cool as the sea. Indigo and violet finish the arc, dark as midnight.

I love to watch it form slowly. The colours start faint, then grow bold and strong. They bend like a bow, reaching from one side of the sky to the other.

When rainbows appear, everything looks more beautiful. The grass seems greener. The sun seems brighter. Even the puddles on the ground seem to hold a little magic.

The best thing about a rainbow is that it never stays long. It fades as the rain stops, slipping back into the clouds. But that's what makes it special. You have to watch while you can.

And that is why I love the rainbows that come after the summer storms. [end of text]
