Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article. Make sure to make use of the hint. Explain your rationale. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

assistant
To determine the date this passage was written, let's analyze the distinctive writing style and content, focusing on the hints provided.

### Rationale for Analysis:
1. **Language Evolution and C++ Features**: The author discusses the rapid evolution of C++ features, mentioning C++20 and C++26. C++20 was released in 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. This timeline is a strong indicator of the time period.
2. **Rust's Slower Evolution**: The author contrasts Rust's slower pace of innovation with C++'s rapid evolution. Rust's latest major feature, async, was released in 2018, and generic associated types were added in 2021. This suggests a period around 2021-2022.
3. **Community and Language Philosophy**: The author mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity policies, which were established in 2018. The C++ community's welcoming nature is contrasted with the Rust community's perceived imperiousness. This suggests a period after 2018 but before the more recent developments in the Rust community.
4. **Specific References and Phrases**: The author uses phrases like "I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now," indicating a long-standing involvement. This suggests a period where the author has had time to observe and reflect on both Rust and C++.

### Specific Indicators:
- **C++20 and C++26**: These are the most recent major C++ standards, released in 2020 and 2026, respectively. The author's discussion of these standards strongly suggests a period around 2020-2021.
- **Rust's Slower Pace**: The author mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed, which aligns with Rust's versioning strategy (one major release every 3 years) and the fact that Rust 2021 (the latest major release) was released in 2021.
- **Long-standing Involvement**: The author's long-standing involvement in Rust and the Rust community, combined with the discussion of C++ features, suggests a period where the author has had time to observe and reflect on both languages.

### Conclusion:
Given the timeline of C++20 and C++26, and the author's discussion of Rust's slower pace of innovation, the most likely date for this passage is **2021**. This aligns with the author's observations and the recent developments in both languages.

Therefore, the best guess for the date this passage was written is **2021**. [end of text]
