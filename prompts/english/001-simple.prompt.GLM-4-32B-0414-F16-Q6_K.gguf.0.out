Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  You would have to count to **one thousand** before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. (The word "thousand" contains the letter "A").

2.  Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**."
    What is the sentence famous for? It is famous for being a **pangram**, meaning it uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3.  Once upon a time, the three little pigs – the diligent brick builder, the cautious stick setter, and the carefree straw layer – were heading home through the forest after market day. As they walked, they heard a familiar voice calling, "Hello, little pigs! Have you seen my grandmother's house? I'm on my way to visit her."
    Looking down the path, they saw Little Red Riding Hood, her red cloak fluttering in the breeze, carrying a basket. The brick pig nodded politely, "No, but we're heading home ourselves. Be careful on the path, stranger things have been known to happen in these woods."
    The stick pig added, "Yes, watch out for anyone trying to blow your house down, although your basket seems quite sturdy!"
    The straw pig just giggled and waved. Red Riding Hood smiled warmly, "Thank you for the advice. I'll be quick. Give my regards to your families!" And with a skip in her step, she continued on her way, leaving the three little pigs to resume their journey home, each perhaps a little more aware of the world around them. [end of text]
