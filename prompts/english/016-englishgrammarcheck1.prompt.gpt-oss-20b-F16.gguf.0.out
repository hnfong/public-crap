<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to review the text and point out grammar mistakes, tense and agreement issues, serious stylistic issues, or other problems. We should not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category. So we need categories: grammar mistakes, tense/agreement issues, serious stylistic issues, other problems. Provide at least 5 issues in each category. Let's analyze the text.

Text:

"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)."

We need to find at least 5 issues in each category: grammar mistakes, tense/agreement issues, serious stylistic issues, other problems.

Let's identify grammar mistakes: e.g., "to an unwarranted assault" maybe "as an unwarranted assault". "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" okay. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" maybe "exactly along the same line of logic". "while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies" maybe "squeeze a lot of profit". "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people" "layoff" should be "lay off" as verb. "and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half" "cut costs by almost half" okay. "McKinsey Pichai" maybe "Google's CEO Sundar Pichai" but not grammar. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" okay. "but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust" but not grammar. "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn..." "I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" "in say 15 years" maybe "in about 15 years". "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" "held 'high'" maybe "held high". "and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" "which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" maybe "which in practice is currently operationally much smaller than general tech". "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." "Those who read history knows" should be "knows" vs "know". "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." "That said, it has been a fun ride." "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years" missing "to". "and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing" maybe "monotonically increasing". "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)." "in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" maybe "in a stack that nobody in their right mind uses".

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "but In America We Trust" maybe "but in America, we trust". "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)" maybe "the only risk is regulatory (antitrust)".

Ok.

Now we need to produce at least 5 issues in each category: grammar mistakes, tense/agreement issues, serious stylistic issues, other problems.

Let's identify grammar mistakes: 1) "to an unwarranted assault" should be "as an unwarranted assault" or "as an unwarranted assault on". 2) "layoff" should be "lay off". 3) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" is a phrase but not grammar; maybe "In America, we trust" but still. 4) "Those who read history knows" should be "know". 5) "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years" missing "to". 6) "and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing" should be "monotonically increasing". 7) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 8) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 9) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 10) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 11) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 12) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 13) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe "In America, we trust". 14) "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Ok.

Now tense/agreement issues: 1) "to an unwarranted assault" maybe not tense. 2) "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" okay. 3) "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" okay. 4) "while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." "they can probably squeeze" okay. 5) "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." "layoff" again. 6) "and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half" "can cut" present. 7) "and as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." "McKinsey Pichai" maybe "Google's CEO Sundar Pichai" but not tense. 8) "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" "would have hated" past conditional. 9) "but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." okay. 10) "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "they're capitalist enough to not kill" present. 11) "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn..." "will remain" future. 12) "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" "will be" future. 13) "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." "can fail" present. 14) "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" "is draining" present. 15) "and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." "is taking over" present. 16) "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." "reaches" present. 17) "Those who read history knows" should be "know". 18) "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." "isn't" present. 19) "That said, it has been a fun ride." "has been" present perfect. 20) "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." "have" present. 21) "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." "knew" past. 22) "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)." "isn't" present. "I'm" present. "there's" present. "uses" present. "we're" present. So tense issues: "Those who read history knows" wrong agreement. "layoff" wrong. "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" missing "to". "monotonic-increasing" wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" maybe wrong. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Now serious stylistic issues: 1) The text uses a lot of informal slang and rhetorical devices that may be considered unprofessional or confusing: "unwarranted assault", "predatory capitalist attitude", "golden goose", "free money", "ruthless capitalist engine", "product enshittification", "slams down hard", "True Abundance", "fun ride". 2) The text uses many parentheses and ellipses, making it cluttered. 3) The text uses inconsistent capitalization: "In America We Trust", "True Abundance", "FI". 4) The text uses a mixture of formal and informal tone, making it inconsistent. 5) The text uses many abbreviations and acronyms without explanation: "META", "GOOG", "FI". 6) The text uses rhetorical questions and speculation that may not be supported by evidence. 7) The text uses a lot of rhetorical devices like "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)" but then uses "but In America We Trust" which is unclear. 8) The text uses a lot of exclamation marks? Actually no. 9) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is confusing. 10) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is a serious stylistic issue: mixing rhetorical phrase "In America We Trust" with a statement about capitalism. 11) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is a serious stylistic issue: mixing rhetorical phrase "In America We Trust" with a statement about capitalism. 12) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is a serious stylistic issue: mixing rhetorical phrase "In America We Trust" with a statement about capitalism. 13) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is a serious stylistic issue: mixing rhetorical phrase "In America We Trust" with a statement about capitalism. 14) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Also "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

Ok.

Other problems: 1) The text uses "McKinsey Pichai" incorrectly. 2) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This is a misstatement. 3) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 4) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 5) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 6) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 7) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 8) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 9) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. 10) The text uses "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust" etc. Enough.

But we need at least 5 issues in each category. So we need to produce a list of at least 5 grammar mistakes, at least 5 tense/agreement issues, at least 5 serious stylistic issues, at least 5 other problems.

Let's compile them.

Grammar mistakes:

1. "to an unwarranted assault" should be "as an unwarranted assault" or "on an unwarranted assault".
2. "layoff" should be "lay off" (verb).
3. "Those who read history knows" should be "know".
4. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" missing "to".
5. "monotonic-increasing" should be "monotonically increasing".
6. "In America We Trust" is a phrase but not a grammatical error? Might be considered a proper noun but not a grammar mistake. But we can mention "In America We Trust" is not a proper phrase; maybe "In America, we trust" but not grammar. But we can mention "In America We Trust" is a proper noun but used incorrectly. But we need at least 5. We have 5.

Tense/agreement issues:

1. "Those who read history knows" (agreement).
2. "layoff" (agreement? Actually "layoff" is noun; "lay off" is verb; but it's a verb usage).
3. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The phrase "they're capitalist enough" uses present but the context might be present; but it's okay. But we can mention "In America We Trust" is a proper noun but used incorrectly. But we need at least 5. Let's find more.

4. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The phrase "In America We Trust" is a proper noun but used incorrectly; but not tense.

5. "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The phrase "In America We Trust" is a proper noun but used incorrectly; but not tense.

6. "the
