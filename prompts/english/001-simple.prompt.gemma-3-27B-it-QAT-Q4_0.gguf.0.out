Okay, here are the answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would have to count to **one hundred and one** (101) before using the letter "A".  All the numbers from one to ninety-nine don't contain the letter "A".

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

"The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**."

This sentence is famous for being a **pangram** – it uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used to test typewriters, fonts, and keyboard layouts.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

The three little pigs, Percy, Penelope, and Pip, had finally settled into their homes. Percy had built his of straw, Penelope of sticks, and Pip, being the most sensible, of bricks. One sunny afternoon, while Pip was admiring his sturdy walls, he saw a little girl with a red hood skipping down the path.

“Hello!” Pip called out. “Are you alright?”

The girl, Little Red Riding Hood, smiled. “Oh, hello! I’m on my way to my grandmother’s house with these treats, but I’m a little worried. I heard there’s a very sly wolf about.”

Just then, a shadow fell over them. It was the Big Bad Wolf, looking particularly hungry. He’d already tried (and failed) to blow down Pip’s brick house, but he was still determined to get a meal.

“Well, well, what have we here?” the Wolf growled, eyeing Little Red Riding Hood.

Percy and Penelope rushed out, trembling. “Run!” Percy squeaked. “He’ll blow us all down!”

But Pip stood firm. “Not today, Wolf!” He quickly explained to Red Riding Hood to hide in his house. He then devised a plan. He told Percy to quickly gather straw and sticks and create a distraction. 

Percy and Penelope, though scared, did as they were told, creating a messy pile near the woods. The Wolf, distracted by the easy targets, chased after them, attempting to blow down the flimsy piles. 

While the Wolf was busy with Percy and Penelope, Pip quickly alerted the woodcutter who lived nearby. The woodcutter arrived just in time to scare the Wolf away for good.

Little Red Riding Hood emerged from Pip’s house, safe and sound. “Thank you, all of you!” she said gratefully. “You were very brave.”

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, always looking out for each other, and Pip’s brick house became a safe haven for anyone needing protection from the Big Bad Wolf.
