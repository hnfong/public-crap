Title: The Bark Under My Uniform

I am Form Four student in St. Paul’s College, Hong Kong, but my real name is not Kelvin Lau. In the forest I am called Thistle-green-by-dawn. My mother hide my pointed ears under a layer of plastic-surgery glue every morning, and she say, “Remember, no magic in corridor, or the CCTV will catch you.” I nod, but the fluorescent light still hurt my eyes like iron rain.

First day of this term, I forget I wear human shoes. The rubber sole is so thick I cannot feel the heartbeat of the earth. I almost cry, but I see the new class teacher Mr. Chan write on blackboard: “Your destiny is in your hand.” I touch the wood inside my pencil; it is screaming. I whisper sorry to it before I sharpen. The pencil shiver and forgive.

During recess I go to toilet stall and peel off a little glue from left ear. The ear pop up like a leaf after storm. The air-condition wind blow on it and I feel home. Suddenly the door bang. My heart jump. It is Ah-Fung, the boy who always sell illegal pokemon cards. He stare at my ear. Time stop. I think I must erase his memory or change him into a bush, but I only have enough magic for one spell per day, and I already use it this morning to make the MTR gate open when my Octopus card have no money.

Ah-Fung blink. “Cool cosplay,” he say. I breathe again.

Lunch time I usually sit alone because my tongue cannot like human food—too much MSG, taste like battery. I bring acorn cake wrap in seaweed so it look like onigiri. A girl from next class, Siu-Ling, walk to me. She have braces that shine like snail trail. “Can I share table?” she ask. I want to say no because birds told me yesterday her friends laugh at my accent, but her voice is soft like moss. I nod. She bite her chicken wing and I bite my acorn. She say, “You eat funny.” I panic. I think she suspect. I quickly lie: “I am vegan.” She laugh, “Me too!” and give me her tomato. I keep it in pocket; tomato is poison to elf, but I will keep it forever anyway.

After school I take bus 23 home. The tree outside window call my real name: “Thistle-green-by-dawn, come back!” I press my hand on glass. The bark under my uniform itch. I want to jump out and run to the hill, but homework is waiting: Physics, about Newton. Newton never understand why leaves fall upward in my world.

Night time, when parents think I study, I climb out to the small park behind our building. I take off shoes; soil remember me. I sing to the banyan tree in old language. The tree answer by dropping one yellow leaf exactly into my palm. I stick the leaf behind ear, under glue, so tomorrow I carry a piece of forest to exam hall.

Mid-term exam come. English paper ask: “Write a letter to your future self.” I write: “Dear Future Me, please tell me you still have green in your heart and the subway noise did not kill the last cicada.” Teacher give me 13/20 and comment: “Off topic.” I don’t care. I lick the paper; it taste of sadness.

One day Siu-Ling follow me after school. She see me talk to a sick plumeria tree. She hear me use vowel that sound like wind. I turn and my tear is silver. I wait for her scream, but she only say, “Can you teach me how to hear them too?” I look at her long. I remember elf law: never reveal. But her eyes are clean like stream after first monsoon. I hold her wrist, press her palm against trunk. The tree show her memory of last typhoon, how it almost break but hold on. Siu-Ling’s face become quiet, like moon on water. She whisper, “They are so brave.” In that moment I love her more than moon loves tide.

We become secret friends. She call me “Tree-boy.” I call her “Snail-trail.” We meet every Tuesday behind tuck shop where the drain smell. I teach her listen. She teach me human slang. My English start growing crooked but happy. “That’s lit,” I say to a sparrow, and the sparrow look confuse.

But secret has price. In November the school hold cross-country run. We must go to Lion Rock Country Park. My bare foot want to dance, but I forced to wear Nike. Halfway the trail, my glue melt from sweat. My ears stand up like flag. A prefect see. He shout, “Discipline check!” I run off path, into real forest. Prefect chase. I jump over stream too wide for human. He fall. I keep running until city sound disappear. I am free, but I am also truant. The school will phone mother. Mother will cry. Glue is expensive. We are poor since we left the grove.

I sit on rock. I think maybe I stay here, become myth, let human paper chase my shadow. Then I hear Siu-Ling voice. She crash through fern, face red. “I cover for you,” she pant. “I say you asthma attack. I bring spare mask.” She also bring double-sided tape for ears. Her hands shake. “Come back, Kelvin. We need you in group project.” She look small, but her heart is drum. I feel something inside me root.

I return. I sign confession letter. I get demerit. Mr. Chan say, “Lau, you are not special; rules are rules.” I bow. I know he is wrong: I am special, but not the way he think.

Last week of term, typhoon signal No. 8. School suspend. Everyone happy. I walk home slow in rain. Water enter my shoes, and I feel the island’s pulse again. At roadside, a dead mynah bird. I kneel, press my finger between its wing. No life. I still have today’s magic left. I break rule. I sing one note—high, thin, illegal. The bird twitch, cough, fly away. A old lady with umbrella see. She drop her umbrella. She make cross sign. I run before she call reporter.

Tonight, mother sit at kitchen table, counting money for new glue. Her own ears, round like human, show the scar where she cut them to fit. I touch her hand. “One day I stop hiding,” I say. She smile, tired. “One day when you strong like mahogany,” she answer.

I go balcony. The rain smell of copper and leaf. Far away, Lion Rock mountain is black tooth against lightning. I speak to it in thunder language: “Wait for me.” The mountain flash back one white light. Promise.

I close eyes. I am still teenage, still afraid, but inside my chest a small sprout push against bone. It write its own homework: Grow. Grow. Grow.

Tomorrow I will wear uniform again, ears folded, name tag crooked. But tonight I let the rain wash glue soft. I let ears free. They listen to the city’s hidden heart, beating slow under concrete, waiting for me to get tall enough to crack it open, one small green crack at a time. [end of text]
