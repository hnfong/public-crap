Okay, here's a review of the text, focusing on significant issues in grammar, style, and other problems, categorized as requested. I'll aim for at least 5 points in each category.

**I. Grammar & Agreement Issues**

1.  **Tense Inconsistencies:** The text frequently shifts between present and past tense without clear reason. For example, "there *is* a running story" followed by "I *wondered* whether..." and then back to "as we *have seen*." This creates a jarring reading experience.
2.  **Pronoun Agreement:** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people…" – The "that" is vague and doesn't clearly connect to the subsequent clause. It's unclear what "that" refers to, leading to a slightly awkward construction.
3.  **Incorrect Verb Forms/Usage:** "Those who read history *knows*…" – Should be "know." Subject-verb agreement error.
4.  **Misuse of "Lay" vs. "Lie":** "they can always *layoff* more people" – Should be "lay off." "Lay" takes a direct object; "lie" does not.
5.  **Dangling/Misplaced Modifiers:** "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough…" – This phrasing is awkward and implies America is actively trusting something. It's a colloquialism used poorly.
6.  **Incorrect Preposition Use:** "...before the companies crash and burn..." - While not strictly *wrong*, "crash *into* bankruptcy" or "crash *down*" would be more idiomatic.
7.  **Faulty Parallelism:** "...layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation..." – While understandable, "wage cuts and wage stagnation" would be more parallel.

**II. Stylistic Issues**

1.  **Excessive Colloquialism/Informality:** The tone is *very* conversational ("So there's...", "I mean...", "really affecting"). While not inherently bad, it clashes with the analytical content and makes the writing seem less serious. The use of "shitty" is particularly jarring.
2.  **Overuse of Parenthetical Remarks:** The text is riddled with asides in parentheses. While occasional parenthetical comments can be effective, the sheer number here disrupts the flow and makes the writing feel cluttered. (e.g., "(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)", "(GOOG mainly)")
3.  **Repetitive Phrasing/Ideas:** The core argument about capitalist pressures and layoffs is repeated multiple times, without significant development. The idea of "efficiency" is also mentioned repeatedly.
4.  **Vagueness & Lack of Specificity:** Phrases like "quite a bit of profit," "almost half," "small pockets of AI," and "funny stack" lack concrete detail. This weakens the analysis.
5.  **Overly Dramatic/Sensational Language:** "crash and burn," "predatory capitalist attitude," "golden goose," "enshittification" – These terms are emotionally charged and detract from a reasoned argument.
6.  **Abrupt Transitions:** The shifts between topics (Andreessen Horowitz, personal investment decisions, broader economic trends, personal finances) are often abrupt and lack smooth transitions.
7.  **Unnecessary Capitalization:** "True Abundance" feels forced and overly emphatic. Capitalization should be reserved for proper nouns or significant stylistic effect.

**III. Other Problems (Logic, Clarity, & Argumentation)**

1.  **Weak Connection Between Sections:** The connection between the initial discussion of Andreessen Horowitz and the author's personal investment considerations feels tenuous. It's not clear *why* the author is sharing this personal history.
2.  **Unsubstantiated Claims:** The assertion that "people who know approximately how much I make…" is based on levels.fyi is presented as a given, without acknowledging the limitations of that data.
3.  **Contradictory Statements:** The author states they didn't make trades due to ideological concerns *but* then admits "the logic is solid." This creates a sense of internal conflict without resolution.
4.  **Oversimplification of Complex Issues:** The analysis of tech monopolies and regulatory oversight is very simplistic. The statement "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" is a naive and potentially inaccurate assessment.
5.  **Unclear Thesis/Central Argument:** While the author clearly expresses a pessimistic view of the tech industry, the overall purpose of the text is unclear. Is it a critique of capitalism? A personal reflection on career choices? A market analysis?
6.  **Reliance on Anecdotal Evidence:** The author's personal experience and observations are presented as if they are representative of broader trends.
7.  **Unnecessary Self-Deprecation:** The comments about the author's "funny stack" of technical expertise feel self-deprecating and don't add to the overall argument.



In summary, the text reads like a stream of consciousness, with a lot of interesting ideas but lacking in polish, clarity, and rigorous argumentation. It would benefit from significant revision to address the issues outlined above. [end of text]
