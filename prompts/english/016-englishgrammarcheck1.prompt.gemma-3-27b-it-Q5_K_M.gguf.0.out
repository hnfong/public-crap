So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Okay, here's a review of the text, focusing on significant issues in grammar, style, and other problems, categorized as requested. I'll aim for at least 5 points in each category.

**I. Grammar & Agreement Issues**

1.  **Tense Inconsistencies:** The text frequently shifts between present and past tense without clear reason. For example, "there *is* a running story" followed by "I *wondered* whether..." and then back to "as we *have seen*." This creates a jarring reading experience.
2.  **Pronoun Agreement:** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people…" – The "that" is vague and doesn't clearly connect to the subsequent clause. It's unclear what "that" refers to, leading to a slightly awkward construction.
3.  **Incorrect Verb Forms/Usage:** "Those who read history *knows*…" – Should be "know." Subject-verb agreement error.
4.  **Misuse of "Lay" vs. "Lie":** "they can always *layoff* more people" – Should be "lay off." "Lay" takes a direct object; "lie" does not.
5.  **Dangling/Misplaced Modifiers:** "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough…" – This phrasing is awkward and implies America is actively trusting something. It's a colloquialism used poorly.
6.  **Incorrect Preposition Use:** "...before the companies crash and burn..." - While not strictly *wrong*, "crash and burn" is often used *into* something, not simply "and burn." It feels incomplete.
7.  **Faulty Parallelism:** "...layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation..." – While understandable, "cuts/stagnation" isn't parallel to "layoffs." It would be better as "cuts or stagnation."

**II. Stylistic Issues**

1.  **Excessive Colloquialism/Informality:** The tone is *very* conversational ("So there's...", "I mean...", "really fast"). While not inherently bad, it clashes with the attempt to present a reasoned analysis. The use of "shitty" is particularly jarring.
2.  **Overuse of Parenthetical Remarks:** The text is riddled with asides in parentheses. While occasional parenthetical comments can be effective, the sheer number here disrupts the flow and makes the argument feel less focused. (See what I did there?)
3.  **Repetitive Phrasing/Ideas:** The core idea about capitalist pressures and layoffs is repeated multiple times, often with similar wording. This makes the text feel redundant.
4.  **Vague/Abstract Language:** Phrases like "predatory capitalist attitude," "True Abundance," and "financial 'efficiency'" are broad and lack concrete definition. They rely on the reader to fill in the gaps, which weakens the argument.
5.  **Overreliance on Qualifiers/Hedges:** "probably," "at least from the capitalist perspective," "I'm not sure," "basically," "relatively" – These weaken the author's assertions and make them sound less confident.
6.  **Unnecessary Intensifiers:** "REALLY fast," "quite a bit," "almost half" – These add little meaning and contribute to the informal tone.
7.  **Awkward Sentence Construction:** Many sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. The sentence starting with "With interest rates..." is a prime example.

**III. Other Problems (Logic, Clarity, & Focus)**

1.  **Unclear Thesis/Argument:** While the author expresses agreement with Andreessen Horowitz's sentiment, the overall purpose of the text is unclear. Is it a prediction? A lament? A justification? A personal reflection?
2.  **Non Sequiturs/Abrupt Transitions:** The jump from discussing META and GOOG to the author's personal frugality feels abrupt and disconnected. The connection isn't clearly established.
3.  **Weak Justification for Personal Frugality:** The explanation for living frugally – anticipating the end of the tech boom and geographical/technical limitations – feels somewhat disjointed and underdeveloped.
4.  **Contradictory Statements:** The author acknowledges ideological concerns with enabling "predatory capitalism" but then states the logic is "solid." This creates a tension that isn't resolved.
5.  **Overgeneralizations:** The statement "every industry goes through this phrase" is a broad generalization that lacks nuance and historical support.
6.  **Unsubstantiated Claims:** The claim about McKinsey Pichai being "definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders" is presented as fact without evidence.
7.  **Inconsistent Tone:** The text oscillates between analytical commentary and personal anecdote, creating a disjointed reading experience. The "In America We Trust" line feels particularly out of place.



In summary, the text reads like a stream of consciousness rather than a carefully crafted argument. While the author clearly has thoughts on the topic, they are presented in a disorganized, informal, and often unclear manner. Addressing the grammatical issues and stylistic problems would significantly improve the clarity and impact of the writing. [end of text]
