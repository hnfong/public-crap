So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The phrase "running story" should be "running story about" or "running story on."
2. "...I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - The contraction "he's" should be "he is" for formality.
3. "...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." - The verb "breaks" should be "break down" to agree with the plural subject "monopolies."
4. "...and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - The verb "can cut" should be "could cut" to maintain past tense consistency.
5. "...the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - The contraction "they're" should be "they are" for formality.

Serious stylistic issues:

1. The text contains several contractions (e.g., "can't," "he's," "they're") which may be too informal for some contexts.
2. The phrase "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally" is awkwardly phrased and could be more clearly stated.
3. The sentence "But I always knew we're in a state of flux" uses "we're" instead of "we are," which is a contraction that may not be appropriate in formal writing.
4. The text uses first-person narrative ("I mean," "I've," "I've always known") which may not be suitable for all audiences or contexts.
5. The text contains several run-on sentences and lacks proper punctuation, which can make it difficult to follow the argument being presented.

Other problems:

1. The text could benefit from clearer transitions between ideas to improve readability.
2. The use of "it's obvious by now" is redundant and could be replaced with a more specific statement.
3. The phrase "the party's gonna end sooner or later" is colloquial and may not be appropriate in all contexts.
4. The text could be more concise in some places, such as the discussion of the author's financial situation.
5. The text could use more varied sentence structures to enhance the flow and readability.
