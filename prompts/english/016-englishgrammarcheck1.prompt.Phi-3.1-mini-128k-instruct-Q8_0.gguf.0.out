 Grammar Mistakes:
1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - "running story" should be "running story about" or "running story that"
2. "...I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - "he's" should be "he is"
3. "...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." - "it seems" should be "it seems that"
4. "...and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - "had" should be "have"
5. "...the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "they're" should be "they are"

Stylistic Issues:
1. The text uses first-person narrative ("I mean," "I've," "I'm") which may not be appropriate for all contexts, especially in formal writing.
2. The phrase "I mean" is overused and can be replaced with more precise language to improve clarity.
3. The text contains several run-on sentences that could be broken up for better readability.
4. The use of "I've" in "I've always known" is incorrect; it should be "I have always known."
5. The text could benefit from more varied sentence structure to enhance readability and interest.

Other Problems:
1. The text could be improved by providing more specific examples or data to support the claims made, especially regarding the analysis of META and GOOG.
2. The discussion on the potential for regulatory intervention (antitrust) is mentioned but not explored in depth, which could provide a more balanced view.
3. The mention of "FI" (Financial Independence) is relevant but could be better integrated into the narrative to connect personal financial strategies with broader industry trends.
4. The text could benefit from a clearer transition between discussing the author's personal experiences and broader industry observations.
5. The conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing the key points made throughout the text, providing a more cohesive ending. [end of text]
