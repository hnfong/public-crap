**The Pillow, the Cloud, and the Love That Would Not Die**

In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young girl named Lila. She was known for her kindness and her love for the simple things in life—like the way the morning sun filtered through the trees, or the softness of a new pillow.

One day, Lila found a strange pillow in the woods. It was soft, warm, and oddly familiar. When she hugged it, she felt a strange sense of comfort, as if it had been waiting for her. She brought it home and placed it by her bed.

That night, she fell asleep, and in her dreams, she was floating on a cloud. It was a beautiful, endless sky, and she could fly with the wind. But as she soared higher, she saw a shadowy figure below, crying. It was her grandmother, who had passed away a year ago.

Lila flew down and asked, “Why are you crying, Grandma?”

The figure smiled sadly. “I’ve been dreaming of you, my dear. I miss you so much. I wish I could feel your love again.”

Lila reached out, and the pillow in her hand began to glow. She placed it on the ground, and the cloud lifted, carrying her and the pillow into the sky. The shadowy figure faded, and Lila woke up with a warm, comforting feeling.

She realized that the pillow had been a symbol of her love for her grandmother. It was a way to hold onto the memories and emotions that could not be forgotten.

From that day on, Lila made a promise to herself: never to exaggerate the pain of loss. Love, she learned, was not just in the moments we share, but in the ways we carry those moments with us, even when we can’t see them.

And every night, she would hold the pillow close, remembering that love, like a cloud, can carry us through the darkest skies. [end of text]
