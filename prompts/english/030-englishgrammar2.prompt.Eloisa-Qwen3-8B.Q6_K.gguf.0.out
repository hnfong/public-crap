Okay, let's tackle these sentences one by one. The user wants the English translations to be simple, fluent, and like a native speaker. I need to make sure each suggested sentence is clear and natural.

Starting with sentence 1: "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？" The original translation is "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" Hmm, "Why are you hurry?" sounds a bit off. Native speakers usually say "Why are you in such a hurry?" or "Why are you rushing?" Also, "you worry that they won't wait for you" might be better phrased as "why are you worried that they won't wait for you?" or "why are you stressing about them not waiting for you?" The original translation is a bit wordy. I'll suggest a more concise version.

Sentence 2: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。" Translated as "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." "Magnanimous" is good, but "doesn't haggle over trivial issues" might not capture the nuance. The original Cantonese says "唔同班𡃁仔計較," which could mean he doesn't bother with petty arguments or doesn't engage in small disputes. Maybe "doesn't bother arguing with the kids over minor issues" sounds more natural.

Sentence 3: "學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。" The translation is "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." This seems okay, but "massive exposure" might be a bit formal. "Massive" is okay, but "immersion" is a common term. Maybe "the key is to immerse yourself in it" or "the key is to be exposed to it a lot." The original translation is clear, so maybe no changes needed here.

Sentence 4: "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。" Translated as "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." The name "Siu-san" is a bit unusual. Typically, it's "Siu Xin" or just "Xiao Xin." Also, "for her being very tender" might be better as "for being very gentle" or "for her gentleness." The structure could be smoother: "Siu Xin praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her gentleness."

Sentence 5: "我日日都搭地鐵返學。" Translated as "I take the metro to school every day." This seems correct. "Metro" is fine, but sometimes "subway" is used. However, "metro" is acceptable. No issues here.

Now, compiling the suggestions while keeping the sentences simple and natural.
