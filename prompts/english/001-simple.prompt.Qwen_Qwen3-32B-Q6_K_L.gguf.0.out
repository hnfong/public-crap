Sure! Here are the answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would have to count to **1000 (one thousand)** before you use the letter **"A"** in the English spelling of a whole number.  
All numbers from 1 to 999 can be spelled without using the letter **"A"**, but **"one thousand"** is the first number that includes the letter **"A"**.

**The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood**

Once upon a time, in a forest not too far from the mountains, the three little pigs had built their homes â€” one of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks. The pig who built the brick house was the strongest and the smartest, and he had warned his brothers about the dangers of the forest.

One day, while the pigs were out for a walk, they heard a rustling in the bushes. Out popped **Little Red Riding Hood**, her cloak bright red and her basket full of goodies.

"Hello, little pigs!" she said cheerfully. "I'm on my way to visit my grandmother. I heard you're the clever ones in the neighborhood."

The pigs were a bit surprised but welcomed her. "We are indeed," said the brick house pig. "We've had a few close calls with a certain wolf."

Red Riding Hood giggled. "Oh, you mean the Big Bad Wolf? I know him too. He tried to trick me once, but I was clever and brought some help."

The pigs were curious. "What did you do?" asked the stick house pig.

"I told him I was bringing my grandmother some food, and I asked him to wait while I visited her. Then I ran to the woodsman and told him about the wolf. Together, we saved my grandmother!"

The pigs were impressed. "You're quite the hero," said the straw house pig.

Red Riding Hood smiled. "Well, I just did what I could. But I heard the wolf is still around. Maybe we should team up and make sure he doesn't cause any more trouble."

So, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood formed a little forest alliance. They watched out for each other, shared stories, and made sure the wolf stayed far away.

And from that day on, the forest was a safer place for everyone.

**The End.**
