Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

It seems like Bob's attempt at a healthy breakfast didn't quite go as planned.

From the conversation, we can infer that Bob ate:

* Aged organic milk (a healthy choice)
* Tomato purée (a relatively healthy condiment)
* Baked whole wheat (a healthy grain)

However, the phrase "tossed over" suggests that Bob might have added a significant amount of oil or fat to his dish, which would make it less healthy. The fact that Alice responded with "wtf" implies that Bob's dish might be a bit...unusual.

Given the context, it's possible that Bob added a large amount of oil or a rich sauce to his dish, which would make it less healthy. Perhaps he added a lot of cheese, cream, or a heavy sauce to his tomato purée, which would make it more calorie-dense and less healthy.

So, while Bob's ingredients are generally healthy, the way he prepared them might not be the healthiest choice. [end of text]
