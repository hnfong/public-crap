The nickname had stuck the day she was born, when the midwife—her own mother, in fact—had gasped at the sight of the tiny, red-faced infant and muttered, “She looks like she’s trying to solve the universe before breakfast.” The name had been shortened, softened, and eventually immortalized on her birth certificate as “Aspirin.”

By the time she was six, the name had become a kind of spell. Children who cried at the sight of blood stopped when they saw her. Dogs that had bitten strangers for years lay down and rolled over for her. Even the school principal, a man who’d once threatened to expel a third-grader for chewing gum in the hallway, offered her his seat on the first day of every month, as if she were a visiting dignitary.

But Aspirin knew the truth: she wasn’t magic. She was just tired. Tired in the way that only children who’ve seen too much can be tired. Her mother, who’d named her, had died when she was four, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a house that smelled perpetually of eucalyptus and regret. Her father, a man who spoke in riddles and left voicemails that sounded like apologies, had vanished when she was seven, taking with him the last photograph of the two of them together—a Polaroid where she was mid-laugh, mouth open, eyes crinkled like crumpled paper.

So she learned to carry the weight of other people’s pain like a second skin. The woman at the laundromat who cried into her quarters because her husband had left her for a woman who could fold fitted sheets. The boy in her class who drew dragons in the margins of his math homework and never spoke above a whisper. The old man at the bus stop who smelled like menthols and told her stories about a war where the soldiers cried when they ran out of letters to write home.

She listened. She nodded. She offered no solutions, because she didn’t have any. But her presence was a kind of salve. People felt lighter around her, as if she’d absorbed their heaviness and tucked it away somewhere safe.

One winter, when the city’s buses stopped running and the snow piled up like unspoken grief, Aspirin found a stray dog—thin, ribs showing, eyes like burnt holes in the world. She named him Ibuprofen. He followed her home, limping slightly, and slept at the foot of her bed. She fed him scraps of toast and whispered secrets to him that she’d never told another soul. When he died—hit by a car on the same street where her mother had died—she buried him in the backyard under a small stone that read: “He was the only one who didn’t ask me to fix anything.”

By then, she was sixteen. The name still clung to her like static. People expected her to be kind, to be wise, to be the girl who could make the world make sense. But she was just a girl who’d learned to carry the world’s pain in her pockets like smooth stones, who’d learned to smile without meaning it, who’d learned that sometimes the best thing you could do for someone was to simply sit beside them in silence.

One night, she climbed onto the roof of her building and looked out over the city. The lights blinked like a thousand small hearts. She thought about her mother, who’d once told her that pain was just love with nowhere to go. She thought about her father, who’d left a note that said, “I’m not gone. I’m just somewhere you can’t follow.” She thought about Ibuprofen, who’d taught her that love could be as simple as a warm body against your legs.

She didn’t jump. She didn’t cry. She just sat there, legs dangling over the edge, and let the wind carry her thoughts away. Somewhere below, a siren wailed. Somewhere above, a star blinked out. And Aspirin—who wasn’t magic, but wasn’t nothing either—closed her eyes and listened to the sound of the city breathing. [end of text]
