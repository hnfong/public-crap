The pillow was lumpy, as usual. Clara shifted beneath her thin blanket, the worn cotton pressing into her cheek like a bad memory. Outside, a cloud passed over the moon, plunging the room into temporary darkness. She sighed, listening to the rhythmic wheeze of her father’s breathing from the next room.

Tomorrow was her eighth birthday. She’d told Mrs. Gable at school, who’d pressed a peppermint into her palm and said, “Sweetheart, your dad will make it special, you’ll see.”

Clara didn’t believe her. Dad never remembered dates. He forgot the library books until they were overdue, left his thermos on the bus, once even wore mismatched socks to Parents’ Day. He called it “exaggerating the small victories,” but Clara thought it was just carelessness.

She missed her mother, who’d died when Clara was three. The photographs showed a woman with a laugh like wind chimes, arms always open. Dad never talked about her. He just worked double shifts at the cannery, came home smelling of salt and exhaustion, and fell asleep before Clara could show him the diorama of a cloud city she’d made from shoeboxes and cotton balls.

That night, Clara dreamed the cloud had come inside. It hovered above her bed, soft and gray, whispering her mother’s lullaby. When she woke, dawn was bleeding gold at the window. And on her pillow—not tucked beneath, not placed neatly, but *there*, as if it had fallen from the sky—lay a small, perfect object.

A silver thimble.

Her mother’s thimble. The one Clara had seen in the velvet-lined box a thousand times, the one she’d traced with her fingertip, imagining it stitching starlight into the night.

She ran to the kitchen. Her father sat at the table, shirt sleeves rolled up, a bowl of oatmeal untouched. His eyes were red. On the counter beside him lay a spool of thread, a needle, and a scrap of blue fabric.

“I tried to fix your pillowcase,” he said, voice rough. “The seam kept splitting. Like I was… exaggerating how good I am with a needle.” He gestured at the thimble in Clara’s hand. “Found it in the bottom of the sewing drawer. Figured maybe… maybe you’d want it back.”

Clara climbed into his lap, the thimble warm between them. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered.

He hugged her, his calloused palm resting on the small of her back. “Your mom,” he said, so softly the cloud outside might’ve carried it away, “she always said love wasn’t in the grand gestures. It was in the mending. The remembering. The showing up, even when you’re clumsy.”

Clara looked at the pillow, still lumpy. But now she saw the tiny, crooked stitches along the edge—blue thread, uneven but strong. Her father hadn’t built a cloud city. He hadn’t spoken her mother’s name. But he’d searched a drawer, wrestled a needle, and placed the most precious thing he could find onto a pillow at dawn.

Love, she realized, wasn’t perfection. It was the thimble left where it might be needed. The stitch made in silence. The quiet refusal to let the broken seam stay broken, even if your hands shook.

She kissed his cheek, the silver thimble gleaming on the windowsill like a captured piece of sky. Outside, the cloud broke apart, letting the sun through. And for the first time in a long while, Clara’s pillow felt soft. [end of text]
