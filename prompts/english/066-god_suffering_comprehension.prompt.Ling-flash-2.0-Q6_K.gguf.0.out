**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**  
The text argues that God, as the creator of all existence, does not impose suffering but allows it as a product of human subjective experience and choice. Suffering and evil exist because we choose to perceive and engage with them, shaped by our beliefs and perspectives. Ultimately, we are responsible for our experience of reality, including its pain, through the choices we make to inhabit and interpret it.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**  
I partially agree that subjective experience plays a major role in how we perceive suffering, as our mindset and choices do influence our emotional responses. However, I disagree that all suffering is purely a choice—some pain arises from uncontrollable external forces (e.g., natural disasters, systemic injustice), which cannot be dismissed as mere perception. While agency matters, acknowledging structural and involuntary suffering is essential for empathy and action.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**  

*In the hand of the All, we dwell and we spin,  
A world of wonder, and a world of sin.  
We choose the lens through which we see the pain—  
In every shadow, we call forth the rain.  

We walk this path, though sorrows may rise,  
Believing the choice is ours to devise.  
Yet winds may howl, and storms may break,  
And still, we wake, and still, we make.  

For in the heart of the great design,  
We craft our world, though not alone, divine.  
So tend the light, and tend the night—  
We shape the dark, we shape the light.* [end of text]
