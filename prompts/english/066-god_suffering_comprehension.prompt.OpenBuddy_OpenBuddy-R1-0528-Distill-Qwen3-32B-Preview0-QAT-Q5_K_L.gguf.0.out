1. The main thesis of the text is that God creates everything, including suffering and evil, and that our subjective experiences, including the perception of suffering and evil, are a result of our own choices. The text suggests that we have agency in our experiences and can change our perspectives and choices.
2. I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the text presents a philosophical perspective on the existence of suffering and evil in the world, suggesting that it is a result of our own choices and perceptions. This perspective may resonate with some individuals, while others may find it difficult to accept.
3. In a world of God's creation, we find,
Suffering and evil, intertwined.
But it's our choice, our own design,
To see the light or let it blind.

We are vessels, shaped by fate,
With qualia's touch, we're set to wait.
Our desires clash, our hearts may ache,
Yet we choose our path, we choose to break.

So let us rise, let us be free,
And change our views, let's see.
For in our hands, the power lies,
To shape our world, to realize. [end of text]
