In the quiet town of Mist Hollow, lived a boy named Eli who believed love was something you had to earn—like a gold star on a test. He’d watch neighbors hug, share meals, or hold hands, and think, *They must’ve done something right to deserve this.* So he practiced being perfect: he never argued, never asked for help, and always said “I’m fine” when he wasn’t.

One rainy afternoon, Eli’s little sister, Mira, climbed onto his bed, snuggled under his arm, and whispered, “Tell me a story about clouds.”

Eli sighed. *Not this again.* He’d told her a thousand cloud stories—clouds shaped like dragons, clouds that cried glitter, clouds that carried wishes. But he didn’t want to tell another one. He was tired. He was *busy* being perfect.

Mira pulled the pillow between them and patted it. “Please? You’re the best storyteller.”

Eli almost said no. But then he saw the way her eyelashes fluttered when she smiled, the way her small hand gripped his sleeve—not demanding, just *there*. And something in him softened.

“Okay,” he said. “But no exaggerating.”

Mira giggled. “I promise *you* won’t exaggerating.”

So Eli began: “Once, there was a cloud named Puff who didn’t know how to float. Every time he tried, he sank like a stone. The other clouds laughed. ‘You’re not built for sky!’ they said. But Puff kept trying—until one day, he drifted into a field where a little girl was crying. Her kite was stuck in a tree. Puff, though clumsy, drifted low enough to nudge the kite loose with his softest edge. The girl laughed, and Puff learned: love isn’t about floating perfectly. It’s about showing up—even when you’re heavy with doubt.”

Mira’s breathing slowed, her fingers unclenched from his sleeve. She was asleep, her cheek resting on the pillow, a smile on her lips.

Eli stared at her, heart full. He hadn’t exaggerated. He’d just told the truth.

That night, he realized love wasn’t a reward for being flawless. It was the quiet pillow beneath your head when you’re tired. It was the cloud that drifts close, even when it’s heavy. And it wasn’t earned—it was *given*, freely, again and again.

From then on, Eli told stories—not perfectly, but honestly. And Mira never asked him to stop exaggerating again. She knew the best stories weren’t about magic clouds or golden stars. They were about love, simple and real, like a shared pillow on a rainy day. [end of text]
