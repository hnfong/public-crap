The figure introduced herself as **Little Red Riding Hood**. She asked for a meal, and the pigs, curious and hungry, offered her some of their homes.  
   Red Riding Hood, in return, offered them a ride home. As they traveled, she told them a story about a witch who lived in a cottage and wanted to eat the pigs. The pigs, frightened, tried to escape, but Red Riding Hood used her cloak to shield them from the witch's magic.  
   In the end, the pigs were safe and the witch was defeated. The story is a classic tale of courage, kindness, and the power of friendship. [end of text]
