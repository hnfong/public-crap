Once upon a time, in a small village by the sea, there was a girl named Lily. She loved rainbows the most. One sunny day, she ran outside and watched the sky. The clouds rolled in, and soon the sun came out, painting the sky with colors. A rainbow appeared, stretching across the sky like a bridge of colors. Lily smiled and ran towards it. She jumped and waved, and the rainbow danced in the air. It was beautiful, bright, and full of joy. From that day on, Lily knew that rainbows were the most wonderful things in the world. ðŸŒˆ [end of text]
