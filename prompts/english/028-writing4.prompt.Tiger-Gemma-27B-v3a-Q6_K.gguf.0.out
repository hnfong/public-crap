## Everybody called her Aspirin -- she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

Not because she possessed some mystical healing power, though some swore she did. No, it was the sheer, unwavering stillness of her. Aspirin moved like a slow-motion film, each gesture deliberate, each blink a measured pause. She wasn’t *trying* to be calming; she simply *was*. Like a perfectly brewed cup of chamomile tea, she radiated a quietude that seeped into your bones. 

Her real name was Elara, but nobody used it. Elara felt…sharp. Aspirin was rounded, soft, a gentle curve in a world of jagged edges. She worked at the corner bookstore, “The Quiet Page,” a fitting title considering her presence. The store itself was a haven for the weary, smelling of old paper and forgotten dreams. But even amongst the hushed whispers and the rustle of turning pages, Aspirin was the quietest thing in the room.

Customers didn’t come to The Quiet Page for the latest bestsellers. They came for Aspirin. A frazzled lawyer would sit at the worn velvet armchair near the poetry section, just *being* near her while she shelved books. A stressed-out student would linger by the counter, pretending to browse while absorbing the calm radiating from her. Even the owner, Old Man Hemlock, a notoriously grumpy soul, softened around her, offering extra discounts and unsolicited advice on herbal remedies.

“She’s like a human weighted blanket,” Hemlock once grumbled, handing a customer a free bookmark. “Drives me mad sometimes, the way people just…lean into her. But business is good. Can’t complain.”

Aspirin never spoke unless spoken to, and even then, her answers were minimal. “Yes,” “No,” “Perhaps.” She didn’t offer opinions, didn’t engage in gossip, didn’t even seem to *notice* the chaos swirling around her. It wasn’t aloofness, though. It was…absence. Like she wasn’t fully present, but rather a conduit for something else, something ancient and serene.

One day, a man came into the store, radiating a frantic energy that made the dust motes dance in the sunlight. He was sweating, his hands trembling, muttering about deadlines and betrayals. He paced in front of the counter, his voice rising in pitch. 

“I just…I need something. Anything. To make it stop.”

Aspirin, without a word, reached for a small, smooth stone from a bowl on the counter. It was a piece of polished river rock, cool to the touch. She placed it in his palm, her fingers brushing his briefly. 

The man froze. His breathing slowed. The tremor in his hands subsided. He stared at the stone, then at Aspirin, his eyes wide with something akin to relief. 

“What…what is this?” he stammered.

Aspirin simply tilted her head, a ghost of a smile playing on her lips. “Just…hold it.”

He did. And for the first time in days, he felt a flicker of peace. He bought the stone, along with a book of haiku, and left the store walking slower, breathing deeper. 

People asked her how she did it. How she could just…absorb the tension from a room. Aspirin never answered. Maybe she didn’t know. Maybe it wasn’t something she *did*, but something she *was*. 

Some said she was a witch, a healer, a forgotten goddess. Others said she was just a quiet girl who worked in a bookstore. But everyone agreed on one thing: being near Aspirin was like taking a long, slow breath. And in a world that never stopped screaming, that was a miracle in itself.
