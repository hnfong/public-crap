Grammar / tense-agreement issues  
- “seem to an unwarranted assault” – missing article: should be “seems an unwarranted assault.”  
- “I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs” – past-tense “had” clashes with present-tense “can”; change to “could.”  
- “Those who read history knows” – plural subject “those” requires plural verb: “know.”  
- “the companies will remain healthy enough … before the companies crash and burn” – future “will remain” vs. present “crash”; switch to “crash” → “have crashed” or keep both in future: “will remain … before they crash.”  
- “I always knew we’re in a state of flux” – past “knew” vs. present “we’re”; use “were” or “we’ve been.”  
- “it has been a fun ride” – present perfect with no clear past reference; either anchor it (“it was a fun ride while it lasted”) or keep consistent past frame.  
- “I would have hated how I participated” – conditional perfect needs a past-tense complement: “how I would have participated.”  
- “they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down” – present “can” inside a past-tense narrative; shift to “could.”  
- “my technical expertise is … in some funny stack” – present tense clashes with past-tense narrative; use “was.”  
- “there’s actually no tech jobs here” – singular “there’s” with plural “jobs”; write “there are.”  

Serious stylistic / clarity problems  
- “In America We Trust they’re capitalist enough …” – sudden caps and slogan phrasing is jarring; rephrase for tone.  
- “McKinsey Pichai” – coining an unflattering nickname for Sundar Pichai may confuse readers who don’t catch the McKinsey reference.  
- “product enshittification” – vulgar coinage without warning; consider plainer diction for wider readability.  
- “True Abundance” – random capitalization signals editorializing but isn’t defined, leaving the point vague.  
- “geographically misplaced” – euphemistic; “I live in a region with no tech jobs” is clearer.  
- “funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses” – self-deprecating humor undercuts the technical credibility you later rely on.  
- Parenthetical remark “(we’re still sane though …)” undermines the prior clause and adds little substance.  
- “the party’s gonna end sooner or later” – colloquial contraction weakens the analytical tone established earlier.  
- “as a whole” in “healthy enough for investors (as a whole)” is redundant; delete or rephrase. [end of text]
