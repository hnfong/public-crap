**Everybody called her Aspirin — she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.**  

There was something about the way she moved, like a slow exhale after a long day, effortless and necessary. Her presence was a balm, a quiet antidote to the chaos of the world. People gravitated toward her without knowing why—only that, in her orbit, their shoulders relaxed, their breaths deepened, and the tight knots in their chests loosened just a little.  

Aspirin never said much. She didn’t have to. Her smile was a silent promise that things would be okay, even when they weren’t. Maybe it was the way her eyes held the soft glow of streetlights at dusk, or how her laughter sounded like wind chimes on a lazy afternoon. Whatever it was, she carried an unspoken magic—one that didn’t fix problems, but made them easier to bear.  

Some said she had been born under a lucky star, others whispered that she had made a deal with the universe itself. But the truth was simpler: Aspirin had learned, somewhere along the way, how to be still. In a world that never stopped shouting, she had mastered the art of listening—not just to words, but to the spaces between them. She knew when to offer a hand and when to simply sit in silence, her presence alone enough to stitch frayed edges back together.  

One rainy evening, a stranger stumbled into the café where she worked, his face drawn with exhaustion. He ordered coffee, but what he really needed was something no menu could offer. Aspirin slid the cup toward him, her fingers brushing his just long enough to transfer a little warmth. He looked up, startled, as if he’d been handed a secret.  

“How did you do that?” he asked, his voice rough with weariness.  

She only smiled, the kind that made the rain outside seem softer, the night less heavy.  

“Do what?”  

The man hesitated, then shook his head, laughing quietly to himself. He didn’t have the words. Nobody ever did.  

That was the thing about Aspirin—she didn’t cure the pain. She just made it easier to live with. And in a world like ours, that was enough. [end of text]
