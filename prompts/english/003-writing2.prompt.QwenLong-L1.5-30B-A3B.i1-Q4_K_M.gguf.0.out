Hmm, the user wants a story under 10 words about loss or grieving. That's a tight constraint—every word must count. 

First, I need to unpack the request: "loss in life and/or grieving" is broad, but the word limit forces extreme minimalism. The user might be testing precision or seeking emotional impact in brevity. Maybe they're processing grief themselves, or perhaps they're a writer exploring micro-fiction. 

I'll avoid clichés like "I miss you" or "teardrops." Instead, I'll aim for a single, visceral image that implies the whole story. The challenge is making it universal yet personal. 

*Brainstorming*: 
- "Empty chair at breakfast." (6 words) → Shows absence, routine shattered. 
- "Her coffee cup still warm." (4 words) → Sensory detail, lingering presence. 
- "No more 'good morning' calls." (4 words) → Focuses on a lost ritual. 

Wait—"Her coffee cup still warm" feels strongest. It's specific (coffee implies morning routine), sensory (warmth = immediacy), and implies the person is gone *now* (the cup shouldn't be warm if they're not there). The warmth contrasts with the coldness of loss. 

*Double-checking*: 4 words. Under 10. Captures grief without stating it. Nailed it. 

...Though part of me wonders if the user wants something darker. But brevity demands simplicity. This works.
