I love rainbows. They are like big, happy smiles in the sky. One day, after a storm, I saw a rainbow in the garden. It was a big, bright arc across the sky, with seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.

I ran outside to see it better. The rain had stopped, and the sun was shining. The rainbow looked like a bridge made of light. I thought, "What a beautiful way to end a storm!"

I told my little brother about it. He was so happy he jumped up and down. We both wanted to draw the rainbow. I used a crayon and drew it on the paper. It wasnâ€™t as bright as the real one, but it was our special rainbow.

That day, I felt happy and magical. Rainbows make me think of joy and hope. They remind me that even after bad weather, there can be beauty. I will always love rainbows. They are my favourite thing in the sky. [end of text]
