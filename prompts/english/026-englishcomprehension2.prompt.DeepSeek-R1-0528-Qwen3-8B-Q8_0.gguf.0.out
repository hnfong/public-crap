First, the problem states there are 3 black blocks on top of a block whose color is unknown, and beneath them is a blue block. So initially, the stack is: top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown color, blue.

Then, all blocks are removed and shuffled with one additional green block. So, the original blocks were: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. After adding a green block, we have: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green. Total of 5 blocks.

Now, these blocks are put back on top of each other, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But yellow isn't mentioned in the original setup. Let me read the question again.

" There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Yellow block? But in the initial description, only black and blue are mentioned. Maybe the unknown block is yellow? Or perhaps there's a mistake.

Let's parse this carefully. Initially: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath them is a blue block. So the stack is: top: black, black, black, unknown, bottom: blue. But "beneath them" probably means beneath the three black blocks, so the order is: from top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

Then, all blocks are removed. So we have the blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue.

We shuffle these with one additional green block. So now we have 4 blocks to shuffle: the 3 black, the unknown, the blue, and the new green block.

But the unknown block's color is what we're trying to find, and now it's said that there's a yellow block on top of the blue block. Yellow must be one of the blocks.

Perhaps the unknown block is yellow. Let's see.

After shuffling and putting back, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

But yellow isn't specified in the initial blocks. The initial blocks are only black and blue, with one unknown.

Unless the unknown block is yellow, but the problem says "we don't know the color," so it could be yellow.

Maybe when they say "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block," it means they add the green and then shuffle all, including the original unknown.

But the key point is that after putting back, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Now, the question is to find the color of the unknown block.

But yellow is mentioned only in the second part. So probably, the unknown block is yellow.

Let's think step by step.

Initial stack: let's denote the blocks from top to bottom.

Top: three black blocks (so positions 1,2,3 are black)

Then: one unknown block (position 4)

Then: blue block (position 5)

But "beneath them" – "them" refers to the three black blocks, so yes, blue is at the bottom.

Now, all blocks are removed: so we have five blocks: three black, one unknown, one blue.

Then, we add one green block, so now we have six blocks: three black, one unknown, one blue, one green.

Then, we shuffle them and put them back on top of each other.

After this, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

But yellow isn't one of the original colors except possibly the unknown.

The original colors are black and blue, with one unknown which could be yellow or something else.

But in the shuffled set, there is a yellow block, so the unknown must be yellow, because green is added separately, and blue is there, but yellow is not mentioned before.

Unless the unknown block is not yellow, but there is another yellow block? But the problem doesn't say there are multiple blocks of the same color except black.

Initially, there are three black blocks, so multiple black, but for other colors, it's not specified.

But when we add green, it's one green, and the unknown is one, so probably all blocks are distinct except for the multiple black.

But the color yellow is introduced only in the second part, so it must be that the unknown block is yellow.

Perhaps "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block" means that we are shuffling the existing blocks plus the green one, but the yellow is part of the existing or added?

I think I need to assume that the unknown block is the only one that could be yellow, since yellow isn't mentioned otherwise.

Maybe the blue block is considered, but blue is specified.

Another thought: perhaps "the yellow block" is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be the unknown block or something.

But the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block," so yellow is a specific block.

Now, after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of blue.

But initially, the blue was at the bottom, so it was under everything.

After shuffling, blue is not necessarily at the bottom, and yellow is on top of it.

The question is to find the color of the unknown block, and it says "only answer in one word," so probably it's yellow.

But let's see if there's any trick.

Perhaps the unknown block is not yellow, but when we put them back, the yellow block is one of the black ones or something, but that doesn't make sense because black is black, not yellow.

Unless the color changed or something, but no, it's about the colors.

Another idea: maybe "shuffle the blocks" means we mix them up, but the green block is added, and perhaps the unknown block is not yellow, but there is a yellow block from the original set? But original set has only black and blue, no yellow mentioned.

Unless the unknown block is yellow, and that's it.

Perhaps the blue block is the one with unknown color or something, but no, blue is specified separately.

Let's read the question once more: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block."

So, the stack is: top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown color, blue.

Then, "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block"

"Shuffle the blocks" – does this mean we shuffle the original blocks, or the blocks including the green one?

The phrasing: "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block" – I think it means we take the blocks (the original ones) and add a green block, then shuffle all of them together.

So, original blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue.

Add green: so 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green.

Then, put them back on top of each other, meaning we stack them in some order.

Now, "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

So, in this new stack, there is a yellow block directly above the blue block.

But yellow must be one of the blocks present.

The blocks present are: black, black, black, unknown, blue, green.

So, the colors are black, blue, green, and the unknown.

For there to be a yellow block, the unknown must be yellow, because otherwise, yellow isn't in the set.

Unless one of the black blocks is considered yellow, but that can't be, as they are distinct colors.

Perhaps "yellow" is a typo or miscommunication, but I think we have to go with what's written.

Another possibility: maybe "the yellow block" refers to the unknown block, but it's described as yellow only in the second part.

But the problem is to find the color, and it's given that yellow is on top of blue.

Since the unknown block is the only one not specified, and yellow is specified, likely the unknown is yellow.

Moreover, the answer should be in one word, so probably "yellow".

But let's see if there's any other interpretation.

Perhaps the initial "an block that we don't know the color of" is not part of the stack when we remove all, but the problem says "remove all blocks," so all are removed.

Then, with the additional green, we have six blocks.

Now, when we put them back, the yellow block is on top of blue.

But yellow isn't listed, so it must be the unknown.

Unless the green block is yellow, but green is specified as green.

No, green is added separately.

Perhaps "shuffle the blocks" means we permute the original blocks, but we add green, so green is included.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me assume that the unknown block is yellow.

Then, initially, stack: top to bottom: black, black, black, yellow, blue.

Then, remove all: three black, one yellow, one blue.

Add green: so three black, one yellow, one blue, one green.

Shuffle and put back.

Now, yellow is on top of blue.

But initially, yellow was above blue, but after shuffling, it might not be.

The question doesn't say anything about the initial position relative to the new one, except that now yellow is on top of blue.

But we need to find the color of the unknown, which is yellow.

Perhaps there's a condition that must be satisfied.

Another thought: the problem might be implying that the only way this can happen is if the unknown was yellow, but initially, with yellow on top of blue, after shuffling, it could be that yellow is still on top of blue or not.

But the fact that yellow is on top of blue now doesn't necessarily mean the unknown was yellow, unless we consider that all other colors are fixed except the unknown.

But let's think about the colors.

The blocks have colors: black, blue, green, and unknown.

When we put them back, the yellow block is on top of blue.

For this to be possible, there must be a yellow block.

The only way to have a yellow block is if the unknown was yellow, or if one of the black blocks is yellow, but black is black, so probably not.

Unless the color is not fixed, but I think we have to assume colors are fixed.

Perhaps "yellow" is a mistake, and it's supposed to be "the unknown" or something.

But the problem says "the yellow block," so it's specific.

Maybe in the context, "yellow" is the color we need to find, but it's given.

I think the simplest answer is that the unknown block is yellow.

Moreover, the problem says "what color is the block we don't know the color of?" and from the information, it must be yellow for there to be a yellow block.

Unless the blue block is the unknown, but no, blue is specified.

Let's read carefully: "an block that we don't know the color of" – this is separate from blue.

So, unknown is not blue.

And yellow is introduced only now.

Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow.

Perhaps the green block is yellow, but green is added, and it's specified as green.

No.

Another idea: maybe "shuffle the blocks" means we are rearranging the colors, but the blocks are physical, so colors are fixed.

I think I should just go with yellow.

But the answer is to be in one word, and it's probably "yellow".

But let's see the question: "Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

So, I need to output just the color.

Perhaps there's a trick with the word "beneath."

Initially, the three black blocks are on top of the unknown, and beneath them is blue, so blue is directly below the unknown, I think.

In terms of position: let's define the stack.

Assume the stack has multiple layers.

Top: three black blocks (so the top layer is black, but there are three blocks, so perhaps it's a stack with multiple blocks per layer or something? No, I think it's a linear stack.

"on top of" might imply a pile.

But in block stacking, it's usually a sequence.

Perhaps it's a stack where blocks are placed one on top of another.

So, from top to bottom: block1, block2, block3, block4, block5.

Block1,2,3 are black.

Block4 is unknown color.

Block5 is blue.

Then, all blocks removed: so we have five blocks.

Shuffle with one additional green block: so now we have six blocks to stack.

Then, put them back, and now the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Blue is one of the blocks, and yellow is another.

For yellow to be on top of blue, in the new stack, blue must not be at the bottom, and yellow must be directly above it.

But the unknown block is part of the six, and its color is what we need.

Since yellow is not one of the original colors except possibly the unknown, and green is added, so the only possibility for yellow is the unknown block.

Therefore, the unknown block is yellow.

I think that's the answer.
