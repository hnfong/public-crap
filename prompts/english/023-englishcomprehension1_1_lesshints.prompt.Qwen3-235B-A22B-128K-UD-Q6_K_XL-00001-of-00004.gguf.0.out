Based on the passage and the hint about the distinctive writing style being connected to a particular day and month, my best guess is that this was written on **April 1st**.

### Explanation of the Guess:

The hint is crucial: it says the writing style is connected to a specific day and month. April 1st is widely recognized as **April Fools' Day**, a day when people create satirical, humorous, or intentionally controversial content as a joke.

Let’s analyze the passage in that light:

---

### 1. **Tone and Satire**:
The passage reads like a **satirical piece**, especially in the way it contrasts Rust and C++. It exaggerates certain points in a humorous or ironic way:

- **Safety section**: The author claims that memory safety bugs "are not fundamentally different than logic errors" and that crashes in GUI applications "aren’t that big a deal." This is a **provocative stance** that many would strongly disagree with, especially in a serious technical context.
  
- **Claiming to be a "good enough programmer" to avoid safety bugs**: This is a classic trope often mocked in programming circles, especially in contrast to Rust’s safety guarantees.

- **"The C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor"**: This is likely a joke. While the Rust subreddit and community are sometimes seen as overly enthusiastic or zealous, the C++ community is not typically known for being humorous — quite the opposite, often seen as more formal or technically intense.

- **"Excellent leadership in the C++ community"**: This is probably a tongue-in-cheek reference to Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++), and the mention of Herb Sutter’s "cppfront" proposal is real, but the way it’s framed sounds exaggerated or ironic.

---

### 2. **Absurd or Dubious Claims**:
The article makes several **intentionally absurd or dubious claims** that are likely meant to be humorous:

- **"Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors"**: This is a controversial and arguably naïve statement in software engineering, especially given the real-world impact of memory safety bugs (e.g., security vulnerabilities).

- **"C++ is safer now"**: While modern C++ does offer safer practices, the idea that it’s a safe alternative to Rust is a stretch and likely meant to provoke a reaction.

- **"C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier"**: Again, this is a **joke**, playing off stereotypes and community dynamics.

---

### 3. **Mocking Both Communities**:
The article **pokes fun at both Rust and C++ communities**:

- It exaggerates Rust’s zealotry and political correctness.
- It mocks C++'s complexity and backward compatibility issues by calling them strengths.
- It ends with a call to action: “Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust” — a typical April Fools' tactic to **stir up controversy** and generate discussion.

---

### 4. **Author’s Intent to Leave Rust for C++**
The idea of **abandoning Rust for C++** because of its safety guarantees and build system monoculture is **counterintuitive** and ironic. Normally, people move *from* C++ *to* Rust for those very reasons. The reversal is a **classic April Fools' joke structure** — presenting something absurd as if it were a rational decision.

---

### 5. **Realism of the Projects**
The mention of **Linebender projects** (which are real — e.g., Druid GUI toolkit) and the invitation to join a **Zulip instance** sounds plausible, but the overall tone and content are **too exaggerated** to be taken seriously — another hallmark of an April Fools' prank.

---

### Conclusion:
This passage is almost certainly an **April Fools' Day joke**, written on **April 1st**, and designed to **troll both
