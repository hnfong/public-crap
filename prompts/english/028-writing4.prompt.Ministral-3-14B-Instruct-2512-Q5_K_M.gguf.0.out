**Everybody called her Aspirin — she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.**

Aspirin wasn’t her real name, of course. That was just what the regulars at the diner called her—partly because of the way she moved, like a slow, soothing balm for whatever ailed you, and partly because of the way she carried herself. She had this quiet confidence, the kind that didn’t demand attention but made you notice her anyway. Her dark hair was always pulled back into a loose braid, a few strands escaping like she’d just rolled out of bed (which, given her schedule, was probably true). Her eyes were a warm, earthy brown, the kind that made you feel like she could see right through you—but not in a creepy way. In a *knowing* way. Like she’d seen every version of you, the good and the bad, and still chose to smile.

She worked the night shift at *The Midnight Grind*, a greasy-spoon diner on the edge of town that stayed open long after the last decent soul had gone home. The kind of place where truckers nursed their coffee until the sun came up, where college kids crammed for exams between bites of pancakes, and where the occasional lost soul—like me—ended up when they had nowhere else to go. Aspirin was the one who kept it all running. She didn’t just take orders; she *listened*. If you were having a bad day, she’d slide you an extra slice of pie. If you were quiet, she’d leave a cup of tea at your table with a knowing look. And if you were the kind of person who needed to talk, well… she had a way of making you feel like you were the only one in the room.

I first met her on a Tuesday night, three years ago. I’d been driving through town when my car sputtered out on the side of the highway, and by the time I flagged down a ride, it was nearly midnight. The diner was my last stop before giving up on the idea of making it to the next town over. I walked in, rubbing my temples—partly from the headache that had been gnawing at me all day, partly from the stress of being stranded. The place was half-empty, the hum of the jukebox playing some old Elvis tune in the background. Aspirin was wiping down the counter when she looked up and saw me.

“Rough night?” she asked, not unkindly.

I nodded, sliding onto a stool. “Car trouble.”

She didn’t ask for details. Instead, she just poured me a cup of coffee—black, the way I liked it—and set it in front of me. “You look like you could use something stronger than caffeine,” she said, nodding toward the pie case. “But if you’re driving, maybe stick to this for now.”

I laughed, despite myself. “Thanks. I think I just need to sit for a minute.”

She leaned against the counter, arms crossed. “You’re not the first person to come in here with a headache. And you won’t be the last.” She gestured to the back booth, where an old man in a worn-out flannel shirt was nursing a cup of coffee, his eyes half-closed. “That’s Doc Reynolds. He’s been coming in here for twenty years. Says this place cures what ails him.” She smirked. “Personally, I think it’s the pie.”

I stayed longer than I intended. The coffee was strong, the pie was better, and Aspirin had this way of making you forget, even for a little while, that the world outside was still turning. By the time I left, my headache was gone, and I had a promise to come back the next time I was passing through.

Over the years, *The Midnight Grind* became my second home. Aspirin never asked why I kept coming back—whether it was the car trouble that had brought me there the first time, or the loneliness that followed me like a shadow. She just always had a seat saved for me, a fresh cup of coffee, and a pie that tasted like comfort. She knew when to talk and when to listen, when to push and when to let go. And she had a way of making you feel like, for those few hours, you were exactly where you were supposed to be.

Then, one night, she didn’t show up.

I walked into *The Midnight Grind* at my usual time, the jukebox playing its usual tune, but the diner was quiet in a way it never had been before. The regulars were there—Doc Reynolds, a few of the truckers, even the college kids cramming for finals—but Aspirin wasn’t behind the counter. A new girl, all bright smiles and forced cheer, was taking orders, but she didn’t have Aspirin’s warmth. She didn’t have Aspirin’s *way*.

I asked one of the truckers where she was.

“Haven’t seen her in a few days,” he said, shaking his head. “Boss said she took some time off. Said she was sick.”

I didn’t believe him. Aspirin wasn’t the type to take time off. Not when there were people who needed her.

I went back the next night. And the next. Each time, the same story: Aspirin was sick. Aspirin was resting. Aspirin was *gone*.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I went to her apartment above the diner. The door was slightly ajar, and I pushed it open.

The place was just as I remembered it—cozy, lived-in, filled with the quiet clutter of someone who loved their space. But Aspirin wasn’t there. On the kitchen table, there was a note, written in her familiar, looping handwriting:

*“To whoever finds this,*
*I’m not sick. I’m not resting. I’m just… gone.*
*Some headaches don’t go away with pie and coffee. Mine didn’t.*
*But don’t worry about me. I’ve been taking care of myself for a long time now. And I’ve been taking care of you, too.*
*Thanks for letting me.*
*—A.”*

I sat there for a long time, holding the note like it was the last piece of her I’d ever have. Outside, the diner’s neon sign flickered to life, casting a dim glow through the window. I thought about all the nights I’d spent there, all the times she’d made me feel like I belonged. And I realized, with a ache in my chest, that she’d been doing the same for everyone else.

A few weeks later, I drove back through town. The diner was still there, still open, still serving pie and coffee to whoever walked through the door. But it wasn’t the same without her. The new girl behind the counter didn’t have Aspirin’s smile. She didn’t have Aspirin’s *touch*.

I never saw Aspirin again. But sometimes, when I’m driving through town at night, I swear I catch a glimpse of her—just for a second—walking down the street, her braid swinging, her hands tucked into the pockets of her apron. And for a moment, my headache goes away.

Because some people, no matter how hard you try, leave a mark that never really fades. And Aspirin? She was the kind of person who didn’t just cure your headache. She made you forget you ever had one. [end of text]
