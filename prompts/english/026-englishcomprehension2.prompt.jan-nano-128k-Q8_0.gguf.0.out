Okay, let's try to figure out this block color problem. So, the setup is that there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath them is a blue block. Then we remove all the blocks and shuffle them with an additional green block. After shuffling, we put them back on top of each other, and now the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

First, I need to visualize the original stack. Let me break it down step by step. Initially, there are three black blocks on top of an unknown color block. So the order from top to bottom would be: Black, Black, Black, [Unknown], Blue. Wait, but the problem says "3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So maybe the structure is: the unknown block is in the middle, with three black blocks above it, and then the blue block below that? Or is the unknown block on top of the blue block? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

Original stack: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath them (i.e., below the unknown block) is a blue block. So the order from top to bottom is: Black, Black, Black, Unknown, Blue. Wait, but that would mean the unknown is between the three blacks and the blue. But if you have three black blocks on top of the unknown, then the unknown is on top of the blue? Or is the blue block beneath the unknown? The wording says "beneath them there is a blue block." So "them" refers to the three black blocks and the unknown block? Or does "them" refer to the three black blocks? Hmm.

Wait, the original setup is: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath them (the three black blocks and the unknown block) is a blue block. So the stack is: top is three black blocks, then the unknown block, then the blue block. So the order is Black, Black, Black, Unknown, Blue. But that would mean the blue block is at the bottom. Then, when we remove all blocks and shuffle them with an additional green block, we have the original blocks plus the green one. So the original blocks are three black, one unknown, one blue. Adding a green block makes it five blocks total? Wait, the original stack has 3 black + 1 unknown + 1 blue = 5 blocks. Then we remove all and shuffle with an additional green block, so total blocks are 5 + 1 = 6? Wait, but the problem says "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block"—so maybe the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, and then we add a green block, making 5 blocks total? Wait, maybe the original stack is 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath the unknown block is a blue block. So the stack is 3 black, unknown, blue. So that's 5 blocks. Then we remove all of them (so 5 blocks) and shuffle them with one additional green block. So now there are 6 blocks in total. Then we put them back on top of each other. So the new stack has 6 blocks, but the problem says that after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but where is the yellow block in the original setup? The original blocks are black, unknown, blue. Then we added a green block. So the yellow block must have been added during the shuffling? Wait, no. Wait, the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then we add a green block, making 6 blocks. So the yellow block is not in the original set. Wait, but the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." So that must mean that after shuffling, the yellow block is placed on top of the blue block. But how does that fit into the new stack?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the original stack and the new stack. Let me try again. The original stack has three black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath that unknown block is a blue block. So the original stack from top to bottom is: Black, Black, Black, Unknown, Blue. Then we remove all blocks (so 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue) and shuffle them with one additional green block. So now we have 6 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green. Then we put them back on top of each other. The problem states that after this, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but where is the yellow block? The original blocks don't include a yellow block. So maybe the yellow block is the one that was added? Wait, no, the problem says "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block"—so the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then adding a green block, so total 6 blocks. But the yellow block is now on top of the blue block. So that must mean that in the new stack, the yellow block is somewhere above the blue block. But the original blocks don't have a yellow block. Therefore, the yellow block must be the green block? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is that the original stack had a yellow block? But the problem says "we don't know the color of" the block in the original setup. Wait, the original setup is: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath them is a blue block. So the unknown block is in the middle, and the blue is at the bottom. Then, when we remove all blocks, we have 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then we add a green block, making 6 blocks. Then we shuffle them and put them back. Now, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But where is the yellow block? It must be that the yellow block is one of the blocks that was shuffled. But the original blocks are black, unknown, blue, and the added green. So unless the unknown block is yellow? Wait, but the question is asking for the color of the unknown block. Wait, the problem says that after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the yellow block must be in the new stack. Therefore, the yellow block must be one of the blocks that were shuffled. But the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then adding a green block. So the yellow block is not in the original set. Therefore, maybe the unknown block is yellow? But that would mean that the unknown block is yellow, and the blue is beneath it. But the problem says that after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So if the unknown block is yellow, then in the new stack, the yellow block (unknown) is on top of the blue block. But how does that fit?

Wait, maybe the original stack had the unknown block, and when we shuffled, the yellow block is the unknown block. But the problem says that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So in the new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow. Because the original unknown block is now in the shuffled stack, and the yellow block is that same unknown block. Therefore, the answer is yellow. But wait, the problem says that the unknown block is the one we don't know the color of. But after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the unknown block must be yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow. But wait, the problem says that the unknown block is not yellow? Wait, no. The problem says that the unknown block is the one we don't know the color of. But after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the yellow block must be the unknown block. Because the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, plus the green block. So the yellow block is not in the original set, unless the unknown is yellow. Therefore, the unknown block is yellow. So the answer is yellow. But wait, the problem says that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So in the new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow. Because the unknown block was part of the original stack, and after shuffling, it's placed on top of the blue block. Therefore, the unknown block is yellow. So the answer is yellow.
