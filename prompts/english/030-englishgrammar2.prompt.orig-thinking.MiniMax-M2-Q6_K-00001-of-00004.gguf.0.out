I need to review the English translations and suggest modifications to make them sound more natural and fluent. The goal is to keep the sentences simple and to the point, as if a native speaker wrote them. If a sentence is already good, I should just output it as is. For example, I’ll look at sentence 1: "Why are you hurry?" and suggest "Why are you in such a hurry?" to improve clarity and flow.

I’m looking at the translation "Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" and thinking it could be improved. A more natural phrasing might be "Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?" or "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait?" The original question feels a bit unnatural, so I want to suggest a clearer version. I’ll also consider the Cantonese nuance, which suggests a rhetorical question about being anxious.

I’m considering how to phrase the translation more naturally. Instead of "Why are you hurry?" I could suggest "Why are you rushing?" or "Why are you in such a hurry?" The second part could be "Are you afraid they won't wait for you?" or "Do you think they won't wait for you?" I want to keep it simple and to the point, so I’ll propose: "Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?" This feels much more fluent!

I’m looking at sentence 2, which translates to "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." The phrase "班𡃁仔" refers to "those kids," but it might be better to say "he doesn't argue with those kids over trivial things." I could suggest "He's a generous person; he doesn't argue with those kids over trivial things." However, I want to keep it simple and natural, so I’ll propose: "He's generous; he doesn't argue with those kids over trivial things." This feels much clearer!

I’m reviewing sentence 3, which translates to "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." I think it could be improved to "There are no shortcuts to learning a language; the key is massive exposure." For sentence 4, "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender," I could suggest "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle." Lastly, for sentence 5, "I take the metro to school every day," I think it’s fine as is. I’ll keep the suggestions simple and clear!

I’m reviewing the translations and making suggestions. For sentence 1, I’ll suggest "Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?" For sentence 2, I’ll propose "He's generous; he doesn't argue with those kids over trivial things." For sentence 3, I’ll suggest "There are no shortcuts to learning a language; the key is massive exposure." For sentence 4, I’ll go with "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle." Lastly, sentence 5 is fine as is: "I take the metro to school every day." I’ll keep the formatting simple and clear!
