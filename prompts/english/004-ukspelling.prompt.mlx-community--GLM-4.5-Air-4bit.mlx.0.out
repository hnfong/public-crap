The rainbows I like best are the ones that appear after a summer shower. They’re bright and bold, with colours that pop against the grey sky. I love how they arc across the fields, like a giant smile painted by the sun.  

Sometimes, if you’re quick, you can see a double rainbow—two perfect curves, one on top of the other. The second one is paler, like a whisper of the first.  

Rainbows never last long. They fade as the clouds move on, but that’s what makes them special. They’re a little surprise, a flash of magic in the sky. And if you’re lucky, you might spot the end of one, where the gold is supposed to be hidden.  

That’s the kind of rainbow that makes you stop and stare. The kind that reminds you the world is full of beautiful, fleeting things.</think>The rainbows I like best are the big, bright ones that appear after a summer shower. They stretch right across the sky, like a colourful bridge made of light. I love how the red is on the outside and the violet is on the inside, with all the other colours in between.  

Sometimes, if you're lucky, you can see a double rainbow. The second one is fainter, like a shy friend standing behind the first.  

Rainbows never stay for long. They fade away as the sun comes out, but that's what makes them special. They're a little gift from the sky, just for you to enjoy while they last. That's the kind of rainbow that makes you smile and feel happy inside.
