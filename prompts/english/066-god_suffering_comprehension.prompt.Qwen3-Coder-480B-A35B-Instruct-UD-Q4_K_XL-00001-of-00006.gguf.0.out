1. **Main Thesis**:  
The text argues that God creates everything, including suffering, but suffering arises as a subjective experience chosen by individuals who perceive it. Our reality and experiences—包括痛苦与邪恶—are shaped by our perspective and choices, not objective truths. We are conscious vessels with agency, capable of changing our experience at any moment.

2. **Do I agree?**  
Partially. While the idea that perception shapes experience has merit, the claim that all suffering is a personal choice seems overly simplistic and dismissive of systemic injustices or mental health struggles beyond individual control.

3. **Poem**:

In the weave of all that's made,  
Lives the joy and pain we've weighed.  
God’s vast love holds every part—  
Even sorrow, mind, and heart.  

We are more than flesh or thought;  
Souls with choices finely wrought.  
Though it's hard to see or know—  
You shape the world you come to show.  

Suffering may seem so real,  
But belief gives it the seal.  
Change your view, then change your place—  
Reality bends to your inner grace. [end of text]
