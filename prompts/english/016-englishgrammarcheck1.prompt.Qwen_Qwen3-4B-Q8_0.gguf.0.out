Here is a review of the text, focusing on grammar mistakes (especially tense and agreement issues), serious stylistic issues, and other problems. I have identified at least five issues in each category as requested.

---

### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)**

1. **"This might seem to an unwarranted assault..."**  
   - **Issue**: Incorrect preposition. "Seem to" should be followed by a noun or gerund, not a preposition.  
   - **Correct**: "This might seem like an unwarranted assault..."

2. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."**  
   - **Issue**: "Onto something" is a common phrase, but it's not grammatically correct in this context. The correct phrase is "on to something."  
   - **Correct**: "I can't help but agree that he's probably on to something, at least from the capitalist perspective."

3. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half..."**  
   - **Issue**: "Ounce of doubt" is a fixed expression, but it should be "an ounce of doubt."  
   - **Correct**: "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half..."

4. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."**  
   - **Issue**: "In America We Trust" is a phrase that should be capitalized as a proper noun, but it's not a standard expression. Also, the sentence structure is awkward.  
   - **Correct**: "In America, we trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."

5. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..."**  
   - **Issue**: "Expectation what" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "expectation of what."  
   - **Correct**: "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like..."

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder..."**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise" is awkward and unclear. It should be rephrased for clarity and flow.  
   - **Suggestion**: "People who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or other sources might wonder..."

2. **"the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'."**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "taking over" is vague and lacks specificity. It should be rephrased to clarify the mechanism.  
   - **Suggestion**: "the ruthless capitalist engine is driving financial efficiency through cost-cutting measures..."

3. **"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance."**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "True Abundance" is not standard and should be rephrased for clarity and consistency.  
   - **Suggestion**: "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't true abundance."

4. **"I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years..."**  
   - **Issue**: "Say" is informal and should be replaced with a more formal word like "about" or "around."  
   - **Suggestion**: "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in about 15 years..."

5. **"we're still sane though, just unique circumstances."**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "we're still sane though" is informal and should be rephrased for a more professional tone.  
   - **Suggestion**: "we're still sane, though it's just a matter of unique circumstances."

### **Other Problems**

1. **"the free money is draining away"**  
   - **Issue**: "Draining away" is a metaphor, but it's not a standard phrase and may be considered informal or unclear.  
   - **Suggestion**: "the free money is being drained away" or "the free money is disappearing."

2. **"product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard."**  
   - **Issue**: "Enshittification" is a slang term that may not be appropriate in a formal or professional context.  
   - **Suggestion**: "product degradation until antitrust actions are taken."

3. **"saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry..."**  
   - **Issue**: The use of "FI" in quotes is informal and may not be clear to all readers.  
   - **Suggestion**: "saving up for financial independence (FI) isn't an aspiration â€” it's a survival necessity in this industry..."

4. **"my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses"**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "in some funny stack" is informal and may be considered unprofessional.  
   - **Suggestion**: "my technical expertise is... in a niche stack that few people use."

5. **"there's actually no tech jobs here"**  
   - **Issue**: The phrase "there's actually no tech jobs here" is grammatically correct but may be considered overly casual or informal.  
   - **Suggestion**: "there are actually no tech jobs here" or "there are no tech jobs here."
