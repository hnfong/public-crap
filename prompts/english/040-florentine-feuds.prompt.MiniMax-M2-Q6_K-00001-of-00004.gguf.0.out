### Strategic Recommendation: Negotiate Secretly with the Medici Agent

**Why:** Under Florentine Renaissance norms, especially *clientela* (patronage networks), *virtù* (skill and initiative), and *reputazione* (reputation), the most prudent course is to secretly negotiate with the Medici agent to acquire the lapis lazuli. This approach aligns with the practical realities of Florentine society, where success often depended on navigating complex political and economic relationships. By securing the rare material, Marco demonstrates *virtù*—his skill and resourcefulness—while preserving his *reputazione* through discretion. The Albizzi’s ruthless enforcement of contracts and punishment of disloyalty makes secrecy essential; if discovered, he risks severe consequences. Thus, the secret negotiation balances the need to fulfill the commission with the imperative to protect his long-term standing. [end of text]
