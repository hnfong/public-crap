 Grammar Mistakes:

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz..." - missing article before "Andreessen Horowitz"
2. "...I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..." - missing article before "something"
3. "...I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy..." - missing comma after "wondered"
4. "...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze..." - missing comma after "functional"
5. "...I had no ounce of doubt..." - should be "an ounce of doubt"
6. "...but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." - run-on sentence, should be separated into two sentences
7. "...besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller..." - incorrect use of comma, should be a semicolon or period
8. "...Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." - should be "isn't true abundance"
9. "...Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity..." - missing comma after "aspiration"
10. "...there's actually no tech jobs here..." - missing article before "tech jobs"

Stylistic Issues:

1. Inconsistent capitalization of "AI"
2. Inconsistent use of contractions (e.g. "it's" vs. "it is")
3. Informal language and tone throughout (e.g. "fun ride", "shitty")
4. Lack of parallelism in some sentences (e.g. "layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation")
5. Overuse of parentheses and dashes, which can be distracting and break the flow of the text.

Other Problems:
 [end of text]
