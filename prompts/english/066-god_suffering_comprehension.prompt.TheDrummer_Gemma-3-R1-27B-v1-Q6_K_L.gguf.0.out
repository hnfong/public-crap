## Answers to Questions:

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering exists not as an inherent flaw in God's creation (which encompasses *everything*), but as a consequence of individual subjective experience. We, as vessels for experiencing creation, choose – consciously or unconsciously – the reality we perceive, including its suffering and "evil." Therefore, suffering isn't imposed *on* us, but rather a component of the specific experience *we* select within the totality of God's creation.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

Partially. While the idea of subjective reality influencing experience resonates (we filter and interpret), attributing *all* suffering to personal choice feels overly deterministic and dismissive of systemic injustices and inherent vulnerabilities. The text's dismissal of "objective" suffering overlooks the real, tangible harm experienced regardless of individual belief.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

Within the All, a boundless sea,
God's law extends, eternally.
We are the vessels, small and bright,
Choosing the lens through which we sight.

The qualia blooms, a mystic hue,
A world we craft, both false and true.
If shadows fall, and sorrows sting,
It's not God's fault, but what we bring.

For in this choice, a power lies,
To shift the view with open eyes.
Though suffering seems a heavy chain,
The key to change resides within the brain.
