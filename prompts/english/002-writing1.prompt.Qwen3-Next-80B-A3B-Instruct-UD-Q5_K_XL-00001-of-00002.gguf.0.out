In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived an old man named Elias who was known for two things: his endless supply of handmade pillows and his habit of exaggerating—always.

Every morning, Elias would sit on his porch, surrounded by pillows he’d stitched from old sweaters, quilts, and even his late wife’s favorite scarves. He’d smile at passersby and say, “My pillows are so soft, they’ve made clouds jealous. One time, a cloud floated down just to nap on one. It didn’t leave for three days!”

The villagers would chuckle. “Oh, Elias,” they’d say, “you’re exaggerating again.” And they’d walk on, thinking his stories were just the ramblings of an old man with too much time and too few visitors.

But one rainy evening, a little girl named Mira knocked on his door. She was shivering, her shoes soaked, her eyes red from crying.

“I lost my dog,” she whispered. “And I don’t have anywhere to go.”

Elias said nothing at first. He simply pulled a pillow from his shelf—soft as a cloud, stitched with patches of blue and gold—and held it out.

“Here,” he said. “It’s the pillow I made for my wife when she was sick. She said it felt like a cloud that loved her back.”

Mira hugged the pillow tightly. She cried into its softness, and for the first time since her dog disappeared, she didn’t feel alone.

The next morning, Elias found Mira still curled up on his porch, the pillow pressed to her chest. Beside her sat a small, muddy dog—her dog, returned.

“I didn’t know I was looking for him,” she whispered. “I was just holding the pillow… and I felt like someone loved me. So I didn’t feel so scared anymore.”

Elias smiled, his eyes glistening. “Love isn’t always loud, child. Sometimes it’s just a pillow… stitched with memories… holding you when you don’t even know you’re falling.”

From that day on, Elias didn’t just make pillows. He made love—soft, quiet, and endless. And the villagers? They stopped calling him exaggerating.

Because now, they understood.

Love doesn’t need to shout.

It just needs to be there… like a pillow… like a cloud… holding you when you forget how to hold yourself.

And that, dear reader, is the quiet, powerful truth of love. [end of text]
