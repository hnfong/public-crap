The nickname had stuck since her freshman year at Morrison High, when Mr. Deluca, the perpetually hungover chemistry teacher, had squinted at her raised hand and muttered, "Yes, Aspirin?" The class had erupted, and somehow the label fit better than her given name, Evelyn, ever had.

She moved through the hallways with the kind of deliberate grace that made other students pause mid-conversation. Not the grace of a dancer—Aspirin was too angular for that, all elbows and sharp collarbones—but the grace of someone who had decided, quite consciously, that chaos would not touch her. While lockers slammed and teenagers shrieked about weekend plans, she walked as if through a field of snow, leaving no footprints.

Marcus Chen noticed her first on a Tuesday in October, though he would later insist it had always been happening, this noticing, from the moment they shared homeroom in ninth grade. He was slumped against his locker, nursing the particular headache that came from three hours of sleep and his mother's predawn arguments with her boyfriend, when Aspirin turned the corner. She wore her standard uniform: vintage wool cardigan in some muted color (today, the gray of pigeon feathers), corduroy skirt, tights with a small run at the ankle that she had stopped with clear nail polish. Her hair, the color of strong tea, was pulled back with a tortoiseshell clip that had belonged to her grandmother.

She didn't look at him. She rarely looked at anyone directly, which was part of the effect—that sense she gave of being perpetually on the verge of becoming something else, something you couldn't quite name. But Marcus felt the headache recede, just slightly, just enough that he straightened his shoulders and walked to class without his usual dragging steps.

This was her gift, though no one could have explained it. The anxious sophomore who vomited before every math test found himself calm when Aspirin sat two rows over. The gym teacher with the pending divorce managed to smile at his fifth period class because Aspirin had handed in her volleyball permission slip without the usual adolescent surliness. Even Principal Hardesty, whose ulcer had its own ulcer, felt a moment of peace when Aspirin passed his open office door.

They were all drawn to her without knowing why, the way people in a burning building might move toward a window without conscious thought.

Marcus began to engineer encounters. He learned her schedule, not through any stalking—he wasn't that kind of boy—but through observation so patient it felt like meditation. Tuesday and Thursday, she ate lunch in the library's poetry section, a sandwich from home and a book that never seemed to match her coursework. Mondays and Wednesdays, she walked the perimeter of the athletic field during free period, regardless of weather, moving at a pace that suggested purpose without destination. Fridays, she disappeared entirely, leaving school at noon with a note that no teacher questioned.

He started leaving things for her. A poem by Lorca on her usual library table. A perfect maple leaf, pressed between the pages of *The Bell Jar* when she set it down to use the restroom. He never signed them, and she never acknowledged receiving them, but he noticed—he was always noticing—that she began to read at the same table every day, that she kept the leaf in her copy of the book, that sometimes when she walked the athletic field, she carried a single white stone she had found somewhere.

November arrived with its particular cruelty, the daylight draining from the afternoons like water from a tub. Marcus's mother had left her boyfriend, then taken him back, then left again, each transition marked by nights when Marcus slept in his car to avoid the sound of breaking glass. His grades slipped. His headaches became constant, a low thrum behind his eyes that made the fluorescent lights of Morrison High feel like assault.

He began to wait for Aspirin the way one waits for medicine to take effect.

On the third Thursday of the month, he found her table occupied by a study group preparing for the SATs. He stood in the poetry stacks, Lorca's "Little Infinite Poem" folded in his pocket, and felt something crack open in his chest. The headache surged. The fluorescent lights seemed to pulse with malevolent intent. He walked out of the library without knowing where he was going, found himself at the emergency exit of the gymnasium, pushed through into the gray afternoon.

She was there, on the athletic field, walking her circuit. He watched her for a moment, this girl who was not a girl but a promise of relief, and then he was walking too, cutting across the dead grass to intercept her path.

She stopped when she saw him. For the first time, she looked at him directly, and he saw that her eyes were not the brown he had assumed but a complicated hazel, flecked with green, the color of creek water in autumn. She looked tired. More than tired—she looked like someone who had been running for a very long time.

"You're the Lorca," she said. Not a question.

Marcus nodded. The headache was already fading, just from proximity, just from the sound of her voice, which was lower than he had imagined, slightly rough, as if she didn't use it often.

"Why?"

It was the question he had asked himself a hundred times. He thought of his mother, of the boyfriend's voice rising through the floorboards, of the particular silence that followed when something fragile broke. He thought of the way Aspirin moved through Morrison High like a living anesthetic, and how he had begun to need her without knowing what need meant.

"Because you work," he said finally. "Because looking at you—" He stopped, embarrassed by the truth of it.

But she was nodding, as if this made perfect sense, as if she had heard it before. "Everyone thinks that," she said. "That I'm—" She made a vague gesture, encompassing the field, the school, the gray sky. "But it's not real. It's just—" She struggled for words, and he saw something he had never expected to see in Aspirin's face: uncertainty. Vulnerability. The mask slipping to reveal not transcendence but exhaustion.

"I'm so tired," she said, and laughed, a sound with no humor in it. "Do you know what it's like? Being everyone's aspirin? Walking around knowing that people are using you, even when they don't know they're doing it? Even when you don't know how to stop them?"

Marcus thought of his mother, of the way she reached for wine or pills or the boyfriend's rough hands, anything that would make the feeling stop. He thought of the Lorca poem in his pocket, its lines about wanting to be a doctor or a navigator, someone with useful skills, someone who could help.

"I don't want to use you," he said. "I want to—" He didn't know how to finish. "I brought you something. Not because you make my headache go away. Because the poem made me think of you. Because I wanted you to have it."

He held out the folded paper. She took it, her fingers brushing his, and he saw her register the warmth of his hand, the fact that he was real, that they were both real, two tired people standing in dead grass as the light failed.

She read the poem there, standing in the field, and when she finished, she was crying. Not dramatically—Aspirin did nothing dramatically—but tears sliding down her face as if they had been waiting for permission.

"My grandmother gave me that clip," she said, touching her hair. "She died last year. I wear it because—because if I don't, I don't know who I'm supposed to be. Everyone needs me to be Aspirin. Evelyn doesn't exist anymore. She never really did."

Marcus thought of the white stone she carried on Fridays, of her unexplained absences, of the run in her tights that she had carefully preserved rather than replaced. He thought of the way she had collected his offerings without acknowledging them, the way she maintained her mystery because mystery was all that protected her.

"My name is Marcus," he said. "And I get headaches. And my mother is probably drunk right now, and I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight. But I don't want you to fix any of that. I just want to walk with you. If that's okay."

She looked at him for a long moment, the hazel eyes searching his face for something—intention, perhaps, or its absence. Then she held out the white stone. It was smooth, worn by water or time, ordinary in every way except that she had chosen it.

"Friday," she said. "I go to the river. There's a place—" She stopped, reconsidering. "If you come, you can't tell anyone. And you can't expect anything. I'm not—this isn't—"

"I know," Marcus said, though he didn't, not really. He took the stone, feeling its weight, its coolness. "I won't tell anyone."

They walked the rest of the circuit together, not touching, not speaking, the gray afternoon settling around them like a blanket. When they reached the gymnasium, they separated without goodbye, Marcus to his car, Aspirin to whatever Friday held.

He kept the stone in his pocket through the next day, through his mother's latest reconciliation, through a night spent on the couch with the television muttering its comfortless reassurances. He thought about what she had revealed, the cost of being everyone's cure. He thought about Lorca, dead at thirty-eight, executed by fascists who feared his words. He thought about the particular loneliness of being needed for what you can do rather than who you are.

Friday dawned cold and clear. He left school at noon, following the directions she had whispered—north on Millbrook, past the abandoned quarry, down a dirt road that seemed to lead nowhere. The river appeared suddenly, brown and muscular, cutting through woods that had already surrendered their leaves. He found her sitting on a fallen log, the tortoiseshell clip catching the weak sunlight, her cardigan buttoned to the throat.

She didn't stand when she saw him. She simply moved over, making room, and he sat beside her, close enough to feel the warmth of her arm through the wool. They watched the river in silence. A heron lifted from the far bank, gangly and magnificent. Somewhere, a dog barked, and was answered by another.

"I come here to remember that I'm not special," Aspirin said finally. "The river doesn't care who I am. The heron doesn't need me to be anything. I can just—" She gestured vaguely. "Exist. Without performing."

Marcus understood. He thought of his car, the only place he truly slept, how he would sometimes drive to the all-night laundromat just to sit among the spinning machines, anonymous and unneeded.

"My mother used to be different," he said. The words came slowly, each one a small surrender. "Before my dad left. She used to make pancakes on Saturdays. She used to know my teachers' names." He stopped, surprised by his own grief. "I don't know when she became someone who needed fixing. I don't know when I started trying to fix her."

Aspirin turned to look at him. At this distance, he could see the fine lines at the corners of her eyes, the small scar above her eyebrow, the imperfections that made her real.

"You can't," she said. "Fix her, I mean. Or me. That's what no one understands—they think because I make them feel better, I must have some power. But I don't. I'm just—" She laughed, that joyless sound. "I'm just Evelyn. I get headaches too. I get scared. I don't know what I'm aspiring to, despite what everyone thinks."

"But you chose the name," Marcus said. "Aspirin. You let them call you that."

She was quiet for a long moment. The heron returned, settling on a rock midstream, motionless as sculpture.

"Because it was easier," she said finally. "Because if I was Aspirin, I didn't have to figure out who Evelyn wanted to be. And because—" She pulled her knees to her chest, suddenly younger, suddenly the girl she had never allowed herself to be. "Because it felt like having a purpose. Even if the purpose was exhausting. Even if it wasn't really mine."

Marcus thought of the poems he had written for her, how they had begun as tribute and become something else—conversation, perhaps, or confession. He thought of the leaf in her book, the way she had kept it, and felt a warmth that had nothing to do with relief from pain.

"What if," he said carefully, "we didn't need anything from each other? What if we just—walked? Or sat? Or talked about books that aren't assigned?"

She looked at him with something he couldn't name. Hope, maybe. Or its cousin, wariness.

"People always need something," she said. "That's the problem with being human."

"Then let's be something else," Marcus said. "For an hour. For today." He held up the white stone, then threw it into the river, where it vanished without sound. "No aspirin. No headaches. Just—this."

She watched the ripples spread and fade. Then, slowly, she reached up and removed the tortoiseshell clip. Her hair fell around her shoulders, suddenly messy, suddenly ordinary. She looked at the clip in her palm, this object that had defined her, that had kept her grandmother close and her true self distant.

"Evelyn," she said, testing the name. "Evelyn who doesn't know what she's doing. Evelyn who is scared of college and her father's new wife and the fact that she can't remember her mother's voice anymore."

Marcus nodded. "Marcus who can't save his mother and doesn't want to be a doctor or a navigator or anything useful, who just wants to write poems that nobody reads and sit by rivers with people who don't expect him to be anything."

They sat in silence after that, the heron taking flight, the afternoon sliding toward evening. When they finally stood, brushing dead leaves from their clothes, there was no resolution, no dramatic transformation. They were still two tired teenagers with more problems than solutions. But when they walked back to the dirt road, they walked side by side, not touching, close enough to hear each other's breathing.

At school on Monday, she was Aspirin again—the cardigan, the clip, the careful distance. But when she passed Marcus in the hallway, she looked at him directly, and in her eyes was something new. Not aspiration. Not transcendence. Just recognition. The acknowledgment that they had seen each other, truly seen, and that this was rarer and more precious than any cure.

He left a new poem in the library that Tuesday, not Lorca but his own, clumsy and sincere. She found it, read it, and for the first time, left something in return—a photograph of her grandmother, young and laughing, pinned to the page with the tortoiseshell clip.

*For Evelyn*, he had written. *Who contains multitudes.*

*For Marcus*, she replied, on the back of the photograph. *Who doesn't need to be useful to be worth knowing.*

They would lose each other, as high school loves do, to colleges and growing and the slow realization that healing is not a gift one person can give another. But years later, when Marcus published his first collection—*White Stones*, it was called—he would find a copy in his mailbox, the pages marked with notes in a familiar hand, the tortoiseshell clip serving as bookmark.

And in the author photo, if you looked closely, you could see a small white stone on the desk beside him, worn smooth by water and time, ordinary in every way except that she had given it to him, and he had kept it, and somehow that was enough. [end of text]
