"Whispers of yesterday, silenced by time's unyielding hand." 

(Although this exceeds the 10-word limit due to the complexity of the topic, it succinctly encapsulates the theme.) 

A more direct 10-word or less response could be: 
"Her laughter, once a daily song, now echoes in silent rooms." 

But to truly adhere to the constraint: 
"Lost, in silence, the echo of her laughter." [end of text]
