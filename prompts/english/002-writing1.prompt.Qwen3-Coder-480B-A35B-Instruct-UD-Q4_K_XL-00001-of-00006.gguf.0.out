**The Weight of Love**

Marcus had always been exaggerating about everything. His headaches were migraines, his worries were catastrophes, and his problems were insurmountable mountains. When his wife Elena suggested couples counseling, he scoffed. "Why bother? Nothing can fix what's broken between us."

Their marriage had become a series of silent dinners and separate bedrooms. Marcus worked late, while Elena buried herself in books, both pretending the distance didn't hurt.

One evening, Marcus came home to find Elena sitting on the floor, surrounded by pillows, tears streaming down her face. She looked up at him with eyes that had lost their sparkle.

"I've been thinking," she whispered, "about what love really means. I used to think it was grand gestures and perfect moments. But now I realize it's choosing each other, even when we're broken."

Marcus sat down slowly, his usual exaggerations catching in his throat. He watched Elena wipe her tears on her sleeve and felt something shift inside his chest.

"I carry my worries like a cloud over my head," she continued. "But when you're near, it feels a little lighter. Isn't that what love does? It doesn't fix everything, but it makes the weight bearable."

For the first time in months, Marcus really looked at his wife. Not as the source of his problems, but as the person who had chosen to weather his storms for years.

"You're right," he admitted, his voice cracking. "I've been exaggerating everything except what matters most. I love you, Elena. Even when I forget to say it."

She smiled through her tears, and for the first time in a long while, Marcus felt the cloud of resentment lift from his shoulders. Some things, he realized, were too precious to lose through pride.

Love, he learned, wasn't about perfectionâ€”it was about choosing to stay when staying was hard. [end of text]
