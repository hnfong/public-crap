This is a concise, almost poetic comment that captures a frustration many gamers feel, especially in platformers like Super Mario. Let's break it down:

**"inertia of running"**
- This is a physics term, but here it's used to describe the feeling of momentum in games. In many platformers, especially older ones like the original Super Mario, there's a noticeable "slide" when you change direction or stop. Your character doesn't stop instantly; they carry some of their forward momentum, which can make precise platforming feel slippery.
- This is often a deliberate design choice in games, meant to give weight and realism to movement. But it can also be a source of frustration when you're trying to make pixel-perfect jumps.

**"makes Mario slip"**
- This is the direct consequence of that inertia. When you try to stop or change direction, the character keeps moving a bit, causing you to overshoot your landing or, worse, walk off the edge of a platform.

**"into the abyss"**
- This is the inevitable result of slipping: falling into a pit, a bottomless pit, or off the screen. It's the "death" state in many platformers.

**"skill issue"**
- This is the self-deprecating or humorous conclusion. It's a way of saying, "I know the game isn't necessarily broken; I just need to get better at controlling this slippery character." It's a common phrase in gaming communities to acknowledge personal fallibility while also subtly blaming the game's mechanics.

**Overall, the comment is:**
- **Accurate:** It correctly identifies a common frustration in platformers.
- **Concise:** It uses minimal words to convey a complete thought.
- **Humorous:** The "skill issue" ending adds a layer of self-awareness and humor.
- **Relatable:** Many gamers have experienced this exact scenario.

**In short:** It's a well-crafted, witty observation about a classic gaming frustration. It highlights the tension between game design (momentum/inertia) and player control (skill). [end of text]
