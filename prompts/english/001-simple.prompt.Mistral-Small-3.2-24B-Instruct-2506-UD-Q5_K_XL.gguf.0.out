1. The first occurrence of the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number is at the number "one thousand". So, you would have to count up to 1,000 before you would use the letter "A".

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"; This sentence is famous for being a pangram, a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs and a young girl named Little Red Riding Hood. The three little pigs had built their houses; the first pig built a house of straw, the second pig built a house of sticks, and the third pig built a house of bricks.

One day, Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the woods to visit her grandmother. She came across the three little pigs' houses. The first pig invited her in, but she saw that the house was messy and not well-built. She advised the pig to build a stronger house.

She then went to the second pig's house. It was also messy and poorly built. She gave the same advice to the second pig. Finally, she reached the third pig's house, which was clean and strong. The third pig had taken her advice and built a sturdy house.

Little Red Riding Hood then continued her journey to her grandmother's house. Along the way, she met a wolf who asked her where she was going. She told him she was going to her grandmother's house. The wolf decided to trick her and her grandmother.

When Little Red Riding Hood reached her grandmother's house, she found the wolf had already tricked her grandmother. But Little Red Riding Hood was clever. She pretended to be fooled and asked the wolf to show her how to trick others. The wolf, thinking he had found a partner in crime, agreed.

Little Red Riding Hood then ran to the three little pigs' houses. She told them about the wolf's plan. The three little pigs, especially the third pig with his strong house, helped her outsmart the wolf. In the end, the wolf was captured, and Little Red Riding Hood safely visited her grandmother.

From that day forward, the three little pigs lived wisely, and Little Red Riding Hood always carried a basket of good advice to share with her friends. And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
