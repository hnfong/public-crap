### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)
1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."**
   - **Issue**: The present tense "are not doing" should be consistent with the past tense "saying" if the statement is being reported.
   - **Correction**: "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically said people in big tech companies were not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."

2. **"And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."**
   - **Issue**: "might seem to an unwarranted assault" is grammatically incorrect. "Seem" should be followed by "like" or "as."
   - **Correction**: "And while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."

3. **"That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations."**
   - **Issue**: "they can cut costs" should be in the past tense to match "I had no ounce of doubt."
   - **Correction**: "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always lay off more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they could cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations."

4. **"In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid."**
   - **Issue**: "I would have hated how I participated" is awkward and could be clearer.
   - **Correction**: "In the end, I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated participating in and enabling this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid."

5. **"Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another."**
   - **Issue**: "knows" should be "know" to agree with the plural subject "Those who read history."
   - **Correction**: "Those who read history know -- every industry goes through this phase in some form or another."

### Serious Stylistic Issues
1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."**
   - **Issue**: The informal tone and use of "So" at the beginning can be jarring in a more formal context.
   - **Correction**: Consider starting with a more formal introduction, such as "There is a running narrative about Andreessen Horowitz..."

2. **"And while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."**
   - **Issue**: The parenthetical comment disrupts the flow of the sentence.
   - **Correction**: "And while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers, who are mostly diligent and hardworking, I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."

3. **"In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG."**
   - **Issue**: The use of "in fact" and the dash can make the sentence feel cluttered.
   - **Correction**: "Back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly considered buying some at the relatively low prices, particularly META and GOOG."

4. **"Those who read history know -- every industry goes through this phase in some form or another."**
   - **Issue**: The use of a dash and the informal tone can be improved for clarity.
   - **Correction**: "Those who read history know that every industry goes through this phase in some form or another."

5. **"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later."**
   - **Issue**: The informal tone and use of "I mean" and "gonna" can be distracting.
   - **Correction**: "People who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or other sources might wonder why I live so frugally. It's clear by now that the good times will end sooner or later."

### Other Problems
1. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."**
   - **Issue**: Repetition of "GOOG" and "monopolies" can be redundant.
   - **Correction**: "My analysis back then was on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG, particularly GOOG, don't seem capable of creating new products or finding new growth avenues
