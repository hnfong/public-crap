1. **Main Thesis:**  
The text argues that suffering and evil are not inherent in the universe but are subjective experiences chosen by individuals as part of their personal journey through God's infinite creation. God is portrayed as a universal mechanism or law, and our subjective experiences—like qualia—are a result of our own choices in how we engage with reality.

2. **Do I Agree?**  
I agree that suffering and evil are often shaped by perception and choice, but I believe they are not entirely subjective. While individuals may interpret or amplify suffering through their beliefs and experiences, systemic suffering (e.g., poverty, war, disease) is real and not just a personal construct. The text leans heavily on metaphysical and philosophical abstraction, which may overlook the tangible, collective nature of human pain.

3. **Poem:**  
In realms unseen, where God’s design unfolds,  
We shape our world with choices bold.  
Though pain may seem to pierce the soul,  
It’s ours to choose, to feel, to whole.  

The tiger’s roar, though fierce and loud,  
Is but a doll in dreams allowed.  
We walk through fire, yet we decide  
What meaning we will carry inside. [end of text]
