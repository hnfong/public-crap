1. You would have to count to **1,000** before you use the letter “A” in the English spelling of a whole number.

   Why?  
   The numbers from 1 to 999 are spelled without the letter “A” —  
   - 1 to 9: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
   - 10 to 19: ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen  
   - 20 to 99: twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety  
   - 100 to 999: one hundred, two hundred, ..., nine hundred, one hundred one, etc. — all without “A”  
   The first number that contains “A” is **1,000**, spelled “one thousand.”

2. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  
   This sentence is famous for being a **pangram** — it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. **The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**

   One sunny day, the three little pigs — Piglet, Piggie, and Porky — were out playing when they heard a rustling in the woods. Curious, they followed the sound and found Little Red Riding Hood, lost and crying. “I’m lost,” she sobbed. “My grandma’s house is this way, but I don’t know which path to take.”

   “We’ll help you,” said Piglet. “We’re going that way too — we’re on our way to build our houses!”

   “Oh, thank you!” cried Red Riding Hood. “I’ll follow you — but only if you promise not to eat me!”

   The pigs laughed. “We’re not wolves — we’re pigs! And we’re building houses to protect ourselves!”

   As they walked, they passed a forest full of trees. “We’ll build our houses here,” said Porky. “I’ll build mine with bricks — strong and safe!”  
   “I’ll build mine with sticks — quick and easy!” said Piggie.  
   “I’ll build mine with straw — light and fun!” said Piglet.

   Red Riding Hood smiled. “That’s a good idea — I’ll help you!”

   But as they walked, a wolf appeared — not a friendly one. “I’m going to eat you all!” he growled.

   “Not if we’re ready!” said Porky. “My brick house is strong!”

   The wolf tried to blow it down — but it didn’t budge. “Hmph,” he grumbled. “I’ll try the stick house next!”

   Piggie’s house collapsed easily. “I’m safe!” he cried.

   The wolf turned to Piglet’s straw house. “This one’s easy!” he sneezed — and the house blew away.

   “I’m safe too!” cried Piglet.

   “I’m not safe!” cried Red Riding Hood — she was caught by the wolf!

   But the pigs were ready. “We’ll save you!” they shouted.

   Porky grabbed a brick and threw it at the wolf — it hit him in the nose. “Ouch!” the wolf yelped.

   Piggie grabbed a stick and hit him on the head. “Ow!” the wolf moaned.

   Piglet grabbed a straw and threw it at his eyes. “Ahh!” the wolf howled.

   “You’re not getting away with this!” cried Red Riding Hood.

   The wolf ran away — and the pigs and Red Riding Hood celebrated.

   “Thank you,” said Red Riding Hood. “I’ll never forget your kindness.”

   And from that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends — and they all lived happily ever after.
