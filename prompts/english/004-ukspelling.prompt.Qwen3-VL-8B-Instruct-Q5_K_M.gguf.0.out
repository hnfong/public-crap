I love rainbows that come after a storm.  
Not the big, flashy ones you see in adverts — no, not those.  
I like the quiet ones. The ones that peek out from behind clouds, just after the rain has stopped.  
They’re shy, like a child hiding behind a curtain.  
You have to look close — and sometimes, you have to wait a bit.  
But when you do… oh, magic.  
They’re made of light, not paint.  
They don’t shout. They just… glow.  
Red, orange, yellow — like a slice of sunshine.  
Green, blue, purple — like a secret whispered by the sky.  
I’ve seen them over puddles, over rooftops, even over my own garden.  
They don’t last long — just a few minutes — but they’re worth waiting for.  
I don’t need a rainbow to be happy.  
But when one appears?  
I stop what I’m doing.  
I look up.  
I smile.  
And I whisper:  
“Thank you, sky.”  
Because rainbows don’t just look pretty — they remind you that after dark, there’s always light.  
And that’s the best kind of magic. [end of text]
