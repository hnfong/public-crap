Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4897
Q4: 349*683=240367
Q5: 6043*7489=45159227
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. The answer is x = 6 (by subtracting 7 from both sides and then dividing by 3)
Q7: What is 25% of 80? The answer is 20 (by multiplying 80 by 0.25)
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The answer is $3 (by subtracting the total amount given to the shopkeeper from the cost of the book)
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The answer is 20 units (each side has length 5, so the perimeter is 4 times this value)
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? The answer is 4 (Katherine plus three siblings)
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. The answer is 6 (by following the order of operations: division before subtraction, evaluation from left to right within the same operation level)
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? I am not sure about this question as it depends on how much each person wants to eat. Please provide more information.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The answer is $20 (by subtracting 25% of the original price from the original price)
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? I am not sure about this question as it depends on when exactly you want to know the remaining time. Please provide more information.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? The answer is 6 (by dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each taxi)
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The answer is 87 degrees (by subtracting the sum of the known angles from 180 degrees, which is the total for all three angles in a triangle)
