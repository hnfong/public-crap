Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

 Yo, listen up. The Federal Reserve, that's like the bank that runs the whole country's money system. They make sure everything stays on track and stable, so nobody gets robbed or screwed over. They set interest rates and print bills, kinda like a hip-hop producer who controls the beats and rhythms of the music industry. So, basically, they keep things moving smoothly and help everyone stay on beat.<|im_end|>
