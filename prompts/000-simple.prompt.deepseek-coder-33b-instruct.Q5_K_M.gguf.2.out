### Response:

Q1: The result of 1+1 equals 2.
Q2: The result of 6*7 equals 42.
Q3: The result of 83*59 equals 4807.
Q4: The result of 349*683 equals 234517.
Q5: The result of 6043*7489 is a very large number, approximately close to 4.5 billion.
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, you first subtract 7 from both sides. Then divide by 3 on both sides. The solution for x is 7.
Q7: 25% of 80 equals 20.
Q8: If the original price of the book was $15 and the shopkeeper gave you an additional $5, the change you should receive back would be $30.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with sides of length 5 units is 20 units.
Q10: A mother has three children - two brothers and one sister. So her total number of children is 3.
Q11: The result of the expression 3 + (12 * 4) - 1 equals 39.
