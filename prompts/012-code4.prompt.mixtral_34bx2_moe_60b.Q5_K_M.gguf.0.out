What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The code will run indefinitely in an infinite loop, so there will be no eventual output printed by the program unless it is interrupted or terminated manually.
