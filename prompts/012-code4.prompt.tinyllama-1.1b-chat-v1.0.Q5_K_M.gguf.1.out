What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program prints the value of `x` repeatedly, starting from a base value of `0.0`, until `x` reaches its maximum value of `math.inf`. The loop iterates over an infinite number of times, and `x` increments each iteration before being assigned to the output variable.
