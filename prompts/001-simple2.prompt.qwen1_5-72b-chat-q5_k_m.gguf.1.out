Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

- It's a highly composite number, meaning it has more factors than any number less than it (excluding its own square root).
- 120 is the smallest number with exactly eight divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 24).
- It's the product of the first four consecutive prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, and 7 (2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 120).
- In base 10, it is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits.
- In binary (base 2), it is represented as 1111000, and in hexadecimal (base 16) as 78.

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions for x:

x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = 9 or x = -2

A3: To find out how many round trips a train can make in a full day, we first calculate the time it takes to travel one way.

Distance (one way) = 200 km
Speed = 60 km/h

Time (one way) = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours or approximately 3.33 hours

Since a round trip consists of going to one city and returning, the total time for a round trip is:

Time (round trip) = 2 * Time (one way) ≈ 2 * 3.33 hours ≈ 6.67 hours

Now, a full day has 24 hours. To find out how many trips it can make in 24 hours:

Number of round trips = Full Day Hours / Round Trip Hours
Number of round trips = 24 / 6.67 ≈ 3.59

As you cannot have a fraction of a trip, the train can complete only full trips, so we round down to get the answer.

Number of round trips = 3 (full round trips)
