Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
 [/INST]  Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell
About a player in the game, doing well
It's the Fed, the Federal Reserve
The one that controls the money, you know what I'm sayin'?

They regulate the flow of cash in the land
Making sure there's enough for your stacks to stand
They monitor banks and lending institutions
To keep them straight and prevent friction

When the economy is looking sick
They step in with a prescription, quick
By adjusting interest rates and such
They try to keep inflation from getting too much

But here's where it gets interesting, my man
The Fed ain't just about money, it's a plan
They got a dual mandate, you see the trick?
Maximum employment and stable prices, that's their gig

So they watch jobs and wages, too
Making sure everyone's got a chance to break through
And when things get wild, they step in with force
Keeping the economy on an even course

Now, I know this might sound a little dry
But trust me, homie, it's a big deal, you feel me?
The Fed's got power, ain't no denying
They keep the economy flying high, no lying

So respect to the Federal Reserve
They got our backs, they deserve
To be recognized for what they do
Keeping America's economy running true.
