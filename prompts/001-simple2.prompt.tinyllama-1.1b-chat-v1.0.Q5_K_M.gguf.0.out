Q1: The significance of number 120 lies in its binary representation. 120 is made up of two decimal digits, namely 1 and 2, which give it the following binary representation: 1000 0100. This means that 120 can be divided into 4 parts by writing each part as a sum of digits (1+0+0+0). In this way, 120 can be rewritten as 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 12.

Q2: Solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 yields a solution of the form x = (a + bc)^(1/6), where a, b, and c are constants to be determined.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. The time it takes to cover a round trip within a day is approximately 4 hours.
