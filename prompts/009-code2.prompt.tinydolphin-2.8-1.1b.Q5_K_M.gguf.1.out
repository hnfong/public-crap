Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a text file sorted in lexicographical order, we can follow these steps:

1. First, open the text file and read its contents into a list of lines. If the file is empty, return -1 immediately because it's not possible to find the target in an empty list.
2. Create two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized as 0. Set the `left` pointer to the beginning of the file.
3. Loop through each line in the list of lines until the `left` pointer reaches the end of the file or the `right` pointer is less than the current line's length.
4. If the target value (`target`) can be found at a position between the left and right pointers, return that position. Otherwise, if the target value is greater than the last element in the list, set the `left` pointer to the end of the file. If it's smaller or equal, move to the next line.
5. If the target value hasn't been found within the current range (between left and right pointers), return -1.
6. Perform a binary search starting from the right pointer until you find the target value. Update the `left` pointer and repeat the process until the target is found or the end of the file is reached.
7. Return the position of the target, which is the leftmost index where the target is found in the sorted list.

Here's a Python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that implements this approach:

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

class Solution:
    def binarySearchFile(self, file_path, target):
        # Open the file and read its contents into a list of lines
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
            
        # Initialize left and right pointers
        left = 0
        right = len(lines) - 1
        
        # Perform binary search until the target is found or the end of the file is reached
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # Check if the mid element is the target value
            if lines[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            # If the target value can be found within this range, check if the mid value is greater than the last element in the list
            elif target < lines[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
                
            # Else, move to the next line
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return -1
