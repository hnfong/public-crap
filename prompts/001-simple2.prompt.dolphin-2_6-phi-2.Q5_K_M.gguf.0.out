A1: The number 120 is highly significant in mathematics due to its unique properties and relationships with other numbers. It is known as the least common multiple (LCM) of all natural numbers from 1 to 12, meaning that it can be divided evenly by each of these numbers. Some interesting properties of the number 120 include:

1. Factorization: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5
2. Divisibility rules: It is divisible by 2 (even), 3 (divisible by 3), 4 (ends in 0 or 4), 5 (ends in 0 or 5), 6 (divisible by 6), 8 (ends in 0 or 8), 10 (ends in 0), and 15 (divisible by both 3 and 5).
3. Prime factorization: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 is prime.
4. Sum of digits: The sum of the digits of 120 (1 + 2 + 0 + 2) equals 5, which is equal to half of the number, making it a special type of number called a pentagonal pyramidal number.
5. Symmetry: It has rotational symmetry of order 3, meaning that when rotated 120 degrees, it looks the same as its original state.
6. Pythagorean triple: The numbers 60, 40, and 20 form a Pythagorean triple (3^2 + 8^2 = 5^2), which is related to its divisibility by 2 and 5.
7. Consecutive Fibonacci numbers: 120 is the product of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers (8 * 18).

A2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Factorize the quadratic equation.
(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Step 2: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.
x - 9 = 0 => x = 9 (first solution)
x + 2 = 0 => x = -2 (second solution)

The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: A train traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart can make the following calculations:

1. Find the time required for one way:
Time = Distance / Speed
= 200km / 60km/h
= 3.33 hours (approximately)

2. Since we want to find the number of round trips within a full day (24 hours), we need to divide the total time available by the travel time for one way.

Number of round trips = Total time available / Travel time per trip
= 24 hours / 3.33 hours
â‰ˆ 7.27 trips

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
