Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 is significant in mathematics due to its properties as both a Pythagorean triple (3,4,5) and a primitive Pythagorean triple (5,12,13). In addition, it is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 10 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). It is also the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of the first four powers of its digits (1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + 4^4 = 153).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this equation, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)

x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2

x = (7 ± √121) / 2

x = (7 ± 11) / 2

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we first need to find the total time it takes to travel between the cities and back.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 200km / 60km/h

Time = 10/3 hours (approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes)

Since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we can assume the train can travel the same distance in the same amount of time without waiting. Therefore, the train can make:

Total round trips = 24 hours / Time per round trip

Total round trips = 24 hours / (3 hours + 20 minutes)

Total round trips = 24 hours / (3 hours + 20/60 hours)

Total round trips = 24 hours / (3 hours + 1/3 hours)

Total round trips = 24 hours / (10/3 hours)

Total round trips = 24 * (3/10)

Total round trips = 72/10

Total round trips = 7.2

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
