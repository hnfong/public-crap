Q1: 1+1= 2
Q2: 6*7= 42
Q3: 83*59= 4,897
Q4: 349*683= 238,067
Q5: 6043*7489= 45,209,027
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   - 3x = 22 - 7
   - 3x = 15
   - x = 5
Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   - 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   - Total money given: 20 + 20 + 5 = $45
   - Change: 45 - 15 = $30
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   - Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   - Mother has 4 children (Katherine, two brothers, and one sister)
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
   - 3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   - Assuming each guest gets one slice, they need 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   - 20% off = 0.20 * 25 = $5
   - Sale price = 25 - 5 = $20
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   - From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes
   - 2 hours = 120 minutes
   - Total minutes = 120 + 45 = 165 minutes
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   - 22 รท 4 = 5.5
   - Since we can't have half a taxi, we need 6 taxis.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees
   - 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees [end of text]
