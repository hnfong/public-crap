Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Okay, let's break down these lift/elevator problems step-by-step. We'll need to consider acceleration, deceleration, and the constant height of each floor.

**Understanding the Physics**

* **Constant Height:** Each floor is 5 meters high.
* **Total Height:** The building is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters tall.
* **Acceleration/Deceleration:** The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² and decelerates at 1 m/s². This means it changes speed by 1 m/s every second.
* **Maximum Speed:** The lift can reach a maximum speed of 5 m/s.
* **Constant Speed Segment:** We'll assume the lift travels at a constant speed for a portion of the journey.

**Question 1: Ground Floor to Top Floor (40/F)**

We'll consider two cases: accelerating and decelerating.

**Case 1: Constant Acceleration**

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   * Distance traveled during acceleration:  d = 0.5 * a * t²  (where a = 1 m/s², t = time)
   * We need to find the time 't' when the lift reaches its maximum speed (5 m/s).
   * 5 = 0.5 * 1 * t²
   * t² = 10
   * t = √10 ≈ 3.16 seconds

2. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   * d = 0.5 * 1 * (3.16)² ≈ 4.89 meters

3. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   * Distance remaining: 200 meters - 4.89 meters = 195.11 meters
   * Time to cover this distance at 5 m/s: t = distance / speed = 195.11 / 5 ≈ 39.02 seconds

4. **Deceleration Phase:**
   * Distance traveled during deceleration: d = 0.5 * a * t²
   * We need to find the time 't' when the lift comes to a stop from 5 m/s.
   * 0 = 0.5 * 1 * t²
   * t = 0 seconds (This is a simplification, as the deceleration isn't instantaneous)
   *  We need to calculate the distance traveled during deceleration.  We know the initial velocity is 5 m/s and the final velocity is 0 m/s.
   * Using the equation: v_f = v_i + a*t
   * 0 = 5 + 1*t
   * t = -5 seconds. This is incorrect. We need to use the equation: v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2*a*d
   * 0 = 5^2 + 2*1*d
   * 0 = 25 + 2d
   * d = -12.5 meters. This is also incorrect. We need to consider the deceleration.

   * Let's use the following equation: v_f = v_i - a*t
   * 0 = 5 - 1*t
   * t = 5 seconds

4. **Distance covered during deceleration:**
   * d = 0.5 * 1 * (5)² = 12.5 meters

5. **Total Time:**
   * Time (acceleration) + Time (constant speed) + Time (deceleration) = 3.16 + 39.02 + 1.25 = 43.43 seconds (approximately)

**Case 2:  Constant Deceleration (more realistic)**

This is a more accurate approach. We'll assume the lift accelerates to 5 m/s and then decelerates to a stop.

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   * Distance traveled during acceleration: d = 0.5 * a * t²
   * We want to reach 5 m/s with a = 1 m/s².  Let's find the time it takes to reach max speed.
   * 5 = 0.5 * 1 * t²
   * t² = 10
   * t = √10 ≈ 3.16 seconds

2. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   * d = 0.5 * 1 * (3.16)² ≈ 4.89 meters

3. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   * Distance remaining: 200 meters - 4.89 meters = 195.11 meters
   * Time to cover this distance at 5 m/s: t = distance / speed = 195.11 / 5 ≈ 39.02 seconds

4. **Deceleration Phase:**
   * Distance traveled during deceleration: d = v_i * t - 0.5 * a * t²
   * We know v_i = 5 m/s, a = -1 m/s² (negative because it's deceleration), and we want to find the time 't' to bring the velocity to 0 m/s.
   * 0 = 5 * t - 0.5 * (-1) * t²
   * 0 = 5t + 0.5t²
   * 0 = t(5 + 0.5t)
   * t = 0 or t = -5.  We take t = -5, which is incorrect. Let's use the equation: v_f = v_i + a*t
   * 0 = 5 + (-1)*t
   * t = 5 seconds

5. **Distance covered during deceleration:**
   * d = 5 * 5 - 0.5 * (-1) * 5² = 25 + 12.5 = 37.5 meters

6. **Total Time:**
   * Time (acceleration) + Time (constant speed) + Time (deceleration) = 3.16 + 39.02 + 5 = 47.18 seconds (approximately)

**Therefore, the time to get from the ground floor to the top floor is approximately 47.18 seconds (using the more realistic constant deceleration model).**



**Question 2: Two People to 10/F and 30/F**

Let's analyze this scenario. The lift needs to travel from the ground floor to 10/F and then to 30/F.

1. **Distance to 10/F:** 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters
2. **Distance to 30/F:** 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters
3. **Total Distance:** 50 meters + 150 meters = 200 meters

We'll use the same constant acceleration/deceleration model as before.

* **Acceleration Phase (0 to 5 m/s):**  As calculated in Question 1, this takes approximately 3.16 seconds.
* **Constant Speed Phase (5 m/s):**  Distance = 200 meters / 5 m/s = 40 seconds
* **Deceleration Phase (5 m/s to 0 m/s):** As calculated in Question 1, this takes approximately 5 seconds.

**Total Time:** 3.16 + 40 + 5 = 48.16 seconds (approximately)

**Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with a Stop**

This is the trickiest question. We need to find the shortest time, which means minimizing the total travel time.  The lift must stop at *some* floor between 1/F and 40/F.

Let 'x' be the floor where the lift stops, where 1 < x < 40.

1. **Distance to 'x':** x floors * 5 meters/floor = 5x meters
2. **
