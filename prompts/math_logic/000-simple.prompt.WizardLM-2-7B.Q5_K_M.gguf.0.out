ASSISTANT: 1. 1+1 = 2
2. 6*7 = 42
3. 83*59 = 4851
4. 349*683 = 236527
5. 6043*7489 = 44906997
6. To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15, then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.
7. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20.
8. You initially give $50 ($20 + $20 + $5) for a $15 book. The shopkeeper owes you change for $35 ($50 - $15). The change due is $35.
9. The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. If each side is 5 units, the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
10. Katherine has 1 mother, and she has 2 brothers and 1 sister, making her the 4th child. Therefore, her mother has 4 children.
11. Evaluating the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 gives 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
12. If each guest needs 1 slice of cake and 5 guests have arrived, they need 5 slices of birthday cake.
13. If the original price of the shirt is $25 and it's on sale for 20% off, the sale price is $25 - (20% of $25) = $25 - ($25 * 0.20) = $25 - $5 = $20.
14. From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes.
15. To carry 22 passengers, you would need 22 / 4 = 5.5, which rounds up to 6 taxis.
16. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. If two angles are 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle must be 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.</s>
