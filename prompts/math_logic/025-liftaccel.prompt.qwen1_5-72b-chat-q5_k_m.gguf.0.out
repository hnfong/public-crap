Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To calculate the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration phase, the constant speed phase, and the deceleration phase.

First, the lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s at a rate of 1 m/s^2. The time to reach the maximum speed is:
t1 = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2 = 5 seconds

The distance covered during acceleration is:
d1 = (1/2) * a * t1^2 = (1/2) * 1 m/s^2 * (5 s)^2 = 12.5 meters

Then, the lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for the remaining height:
Total height = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters
Distance during constant speed = Total height - Distance during acceleration = 200 m - 12.5 m = 187.5 meters

Time at constant speed = d2 / v = 187.5 m / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds

Finally, the lift decelerates at the same rate of 1 m/s^2 to stop. The time for deceleration is the same as the acceleration time:
t3 = t1 = 5 seconds

The distance during deceleration is also the same as the distance during acceleration:
d3 = d1 = 12.5 meters

Total time = t1 + t2 + t3 = 5 s + 37.5 s + 5 s = 47.5 seconds

1. For the two people going to different floors, the lift will stop at 10/ F and then at 30/ F. The time taken will be the same as the time taken to go to the top floor, as the lift will accelerate, decelerate, and travel at constant speed for the same total height. So, the time is 47.5 seconds.

1. For the lift to stop at another floor between 1/ F and 40/ F, we need to consider the additional time for deceleration, stopping, and acceleration again. Let's assume the lift stops at floor 20/ F.

The lift will decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, then stop, and then accelerate back to 5 m/s. The time for each deceleration/acceleration is 5 seconds, so that's an additional 10 seconds.

The distance for deceleration and acceleration is the same as before, 12.5 meters each, which is a total of 25 meters. Since the lift is stopping at floor 20/ F, it will travel an additional 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.

The time to travel these additional 100 meters at constant speed is:
t20 = 100 m / 5 m/s = 20 seconds

So, the minimum additional time is:
t_additional = t_stop + t20 = 10 s + 20 s = 30 seconds

Adding this to the time to go to 40/ F without stopping:
Total time = 47.5 s + 30 s = 77.5 seconds

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/ F if it has to stop at another floor is 77.5 seconds. [end of text]
