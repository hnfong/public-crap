I need to solve these elevator problems. The building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall, so the total height is 40 * 5 = 200 meters. The elevator accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s² and has a max speed of 5 m/s.

First question: How long does it take to go from ground to top floor without stopping.

Since it accelerates and decelerates, I need to find the time for acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration phases.

Let the acceleration phase be t_a, deceleration phase t_d, and constant speed phase t_c.

Since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, t_a = t_d.

Acceleration a = 1 m/s², max speed v_max = 5 m/s.

So, time to reach max speed: v = u + at, u=0, so t_a = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds.

Similarly, t_d = 5 seconds.

Distance covered during acceleration: s = ut + (1/2)at² = 0 + (1/2)(1)(5)² = (1/2)(25) = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, deceleration distance: 12.5 meters.

Total distance s_total = 200 meters.

So, distance covered at constant speed: s_c = s_total - s_a - s_d = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters.

Time at constant speed: t_c = s_c / v_max = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

Total time: t_a + t_c + t_d = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

Is that it? Seems straightforward. But let me confirm.

I could use the formula for time with constant acceleration.

The elevator starts from rest and ends at rest, so the average speed is (v_i + v_f)/2 = (0 + 5)/2 = 2.5 m/s, but only if it reaches max speed, which it does.

In this case, since it accelerates to max speed and decelerates, the average speed over the whole trip is not simply (0 + 5)/2 because of the constant speed phase.

The average speed for the entire trip is total distance over total time.

Total distance 200m, total time 45s, average speed 200/45 ≈ 4.444 m/s, which is between 0 and 5, makes sense.

The time to accelerate to max speed is 5s, distance 12.5m, as above.

Deceleration same.

Constant speed for 175m at 5m/s, 35s.

Total time 45s.

But is there a point where it doesn't reach max speed? Let me check if the distance is sufficient.

The maximum distance it can cover with acceleration and deceleration without constant speed is when it accelerates to max speed and immediately decelerates.

Distance for that: s = (v_max)^2 / (2a) + (v_max)^2 / (2a) = v_max^2 / a = 25 / 1 = 25 meters.

But here total distance is 200m > 25m, so it does reach max speed and has a constant speed phase.

So, for question 1, it should be 45 seconds.

But let me write it properly.

t_total = t_a + t_c + t_d = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45s.

Since t_a = t_d, and s_a = s_d = (1/2) a t_a^2 = (1/2)(1)(25) = 12.5m.

s_c = 200 - 25 = 175m.

t_c = 175 / 5 = 35s.

t_a = t_d = 5s.

Total t = 45s.

Okay, I think that's correct.

Now, question 2: Two people get on at ground. First goes to 10/F, second to 30/F.

So, the elevator starts at 1/F, goes to 10/F, stops, then to 30/F, stops.

Each stop might take some time, but the problem doesn't specify any stop time. It just says "how long does it take", but probably we need to consider the time for the elevator to move, and perhaps the time to open doors or something, but it's not mentioned.

Looking back at the problem: "How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?" for question 1, and similarly for others.

In question 1, it's a direct trip, no stops.

In question 2, it has to stop at 10/F and 30/F.

But when it stops, does it take time? The problem doesn't specify any door opening time or anything. It just gives acceleration and max speed.

Probably, we assume that the stops are instantaneous, meaning that the time to stop and start is included in the acceleration and deceleration, but when it stops, it decelerates to zero, and then accelerates again.

But in this case, since it's stopping at floors, we need to consider the motion between stops.

Moreover, for the first person, the trip is from 1/F to 10/F, and for the second, from 1/F to 30/F, but since they are on the same lift, the total time for the lift to complete its journey might be different.

The question is: "How long does it take?" but it doesn't specify for whom. Let me read carefully.

"Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?"

It doesn't specify for which person or for the lift. But probably, since it's "how long does it take", and it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's asking for the total time for the lift to go from ground to 30/F, since that's where the second person gets off, and the first person gets off earlier.

But the first person gets off at 10/F, so for him, the trip is shorter, but the question might be asking for the time until both have reached their destinations, but that would be when the second person gets off at 30/F.

Perhaps it's asking for the time for the lift to complete its trip, i.e., from 1/F to 30/F with a stop at 10/F.

I think that's the most reasonable interpretation. Because if it were for each person, it would be different, but the question is phrased as "how long does it take" without specifying, but in context, probably the total time for the elevator to go to 30/F.

Moreover, in question 3, it's about getting to 40/F with a stop, so likely here it's the time for the elevator to reach 30/F.

So, I'll assume that.

So, elevator starts at 1/F, goes to 10/F, stops (instantaneously), then goes to 30/F, stops.

We need the time from start at 1/F to arrival at 30/F.

Now, the distances: each floor is 5m, so from 1/F to 10/F is 9 floors up? Let's see.

Ground floor is 1/F, top is 40/F, so from 1/F to 10/F is 9 intervals? No.

The height: floor 1 to floor 2 is 5m, so from floor 1 to floor n is (n-1)*5 meters? No.

Typically, the ground floor is at height 0, first floor at 5m, second at 10m, etc.

The problem says: "ground floor (1/F)", and "top floor (40/F)", and "each floor is 5 meters tall", so I think the height of floor n is (n-1)*5 meters? Let's clarify.

Usually, ground floor is at height 0, first floor is at height 5m, second at 10m, so floor k is at height (k-1)*5 meters.

But in the problem, it says "ground floor (1/F)", so probably 1/F is ground, at height 0.

Then 2/F at 5m, 3/F at 10m, ..., 40/F at 39*5 = 195m? But earlier I calculated total height as 40*5=200m, which would imply that floor 40 is at 200m, so floor 1 at 0, floor 2 at 5m, ..., floor 40 at 195m? 39 intervals *5
