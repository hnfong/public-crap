<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer all questions. Let's compute.

Q1: 1+1=2.

Q2: 6*7=42.

Q3: 83*59. Compute: 83*59 = 83*(60-1)=83*60-83=4980-83=4897. Check: 83*59 = 83*50 + 83*9 = 4150 + 747 = 4897. Yes.

Q4: 349*683. Compute: 349*683 = 349*(700-17) = 349*700 - 349*17 = 244300 - (349*17). 349*17 = 349*10 + 349*7 = 3490 + 2443 = 5933. So 244300 - 5933 = 238367. Let's double-check: 683*349. 683*300=204900, 683*40=27320, 683*9=6147. Sum: 204900+27320=232220, +6147=238367. Yes.

Q5: 6043*7489. Compute. Let's do multiplication: 6043 * 7489.

We can compute 6043 * 7489 = 6043*(7000+400+80+9). Actually 7489 = 7000 + 400 + 80 + 9.

6043*7000 = 42,301,000? Wait 6043*7000 = 6043*7*1000 = 42,301*1000? Let's compute: 6043*7 = 42,301. Then times 1000 = 42,301,000.

6043*400 = 6043*4*100 = 24,172*100 = 2,417,200.

6043*80 = 6043*8*10 = 48,344*10 = 483,440.

6043*9 = 54,387.

Now sum: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200. Add 483,440 => 45,201,640. Add 54,387 => 45,256,027. So answer: 45,256,027.

Let's double-check with alternative method: 7489*6043. 7489*6000 = 44,934,000. 7489*43 = 7489*40 + 7489*3 = 299,560 + 22,467 = 322,027. Sum: 44,934,000 + 322,027 = 45,256,027. Yes.

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? Let's compute: I gave $20 + $20 + $5 = $45. Book costs $15. So change = $45 - $15 = $30. So shopkeeper should give me $30.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side length 5 units: 4*5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. Wait: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. That means Katherine has 2 brothers and 1 sister. So total children: Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4. So mother has 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. According to order of operations: division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then 3 + 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. So answer 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Usually each guest gets one slice? But maybe they need 5 slices. But maybe Tom also needs a slice? The question: "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" Usually each guest gets one slice, so 5 slices. But maybe Tom also needs a slice? The question says "they need" referring to the guests? It says "5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" The pronoun "they" could refer to the guests. So answer: 5 slices. But maybe they need 5 slices for the guests. So answer: 5 slices.

Q13: Shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off. Sale price = 25 * (1 - 0.20) = 25 * 0.80 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? From 3:45 to 6:30. Let's compute: 3:45 to 4:00 = 15 minutes. 4:00 to 6:30 = 2 hours 30 minutes = 150 minutes. Total = 15 + 150 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, difference: 6:30 - 3:45 = 2 hours 45 minutes = 165 minutes. Yes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? 22 / 4 = 5.5. So need 6 taxis (since you can't have half a taxi). So answer: 6 taxis.

Q16: Triangle has two angles 31° and 62°. Sum of angles in triangle = 180°. Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87°.
