<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer each question. Let's go through.

Q1: 1+1=2.

Q2: 6*7=42.

Q3: 83*59. Compute: 83*59 = 83*(60-1)=83*60 - 83 = 4980 - 83 = 4897. Check: 80*59=4720, 3*59=177, sum=4897. Yes.

Q4: 349*683. Compute: 349*683 = 349*(700-17) = 349*700 - 349*17 = 244300 - (349*17). 349*17 = 349*10 + 349*7 = 3490 + 2443 = 5933. So 244300 - 5933 = 238367. Let's double-check with alternative: 683*349. 683*300=204900, 683*40=27320, 683*9=6147. Sum: 204900+27320=232220, +6147=238367. Yes.

Q5: 6043*7489. Compute. Let's do multiplication. 6043 * 7489.

We can do 6043*(7489) = 6043*(7000 + 400 + 80 + 9). Actually 7489 = 7000 + 400 + 80 + 9.

6043*7000 = 42,301,000? Wait 6043*7000 = 6043*7*1000 = 42,301*1000? Let's compute: 6043*7 = 42,301. Then times 1000 = 42,301,000.

6043*400 = 6043*4*100 = 24,172*100 = 2,417,200.

6043*80 = 6043*8*10 = 48,344*10 = 483,440.

6043*9 = 54,387.

Now sum: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200. Add 483,440 = 45,201,640. Add 54,387 = 45,256,027. So answer: 45,256,027.

Let's double-check with alternative: 7489*6043. 7489*6000 = 44,934,000. 7489*43 = 7489*40 + 7489*3 = 299,560 + 22,467 = 322,027. Sum: 44,934,000 + 322,027 = 45,256,027. Yes.

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? Let's compute: Total given: 20+20+5 = 45. Book cost 15. Change = 45-15 = 30. So shopkeeper should give $30 back.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side length 5 units: 4*5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. Wait: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. That means Katherine has 2 brothers and 1 sister (not counting herself). So total children = 1 (Katherine) + 2 + 1 = 4. So answer: 4.

Q11: Evaluate expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. According to order of operations: division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then 3 + 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. So answer: 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Usually one slice per guest? But maybe they need one slice per guest plus Tom? The question ambiguous. But likely they need 5 slices. But maybe they need 5 slices for guests plus one for Tom? The question: "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" Usually each guest gets a slice. So answer: 5 slices. But maybe they need 5 slices for guests, plus one for Tom? But Tom is the host, maybe he also gets a slice. But the question says "they need" maybe refers to the group of guests. I'd answer 5 slices.

Q13: Shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off. Sale price = 25 * (1 - 0.20) = 25 * 0.80 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? From 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours 45 minutes? Let's compute: 3:45 to 4:45 = 60 min. 4:45 to 5:45 = 60 min. 5:45 to 6:30 = 45 min. Total = 60+60+45 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, 6:30 - 3:45 = 2h45m = 165 min. So answer: 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? Divide 22 by 4: 4*5=20, remainder 2. So need 6 taxis. So answer: 6.

Q16: Triangle has two angles 31° and 62°. Sum = 93°. Third angle = 180 - 93 = 87°.
