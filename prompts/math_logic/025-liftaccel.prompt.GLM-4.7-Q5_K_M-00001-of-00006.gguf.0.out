Here are the step-by-step solutions to the math questions.

### **Parameters and Assumptions**

*   **Building Height:** 40 stories.
*   **Floor Height:** 5 meters.
*   **Total Height to Top (40/F):** $40 \times 5 = 200$ meters.
*   **Elevator Motion:**
    *   Acceleration ($a$): $1 \text{ m/s}^2$
    *   Deceleration ($d$): $1 \text{ m/s}^2$
    *   Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$): $5 \text{ m/s}$
*   **Kinematics Formulas:**
    *   $v = a \times t$
    *   $d = 0.5 \times a \times t^2$
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume the time taken for the elevator doors to open and close, and for passengers to enter/exit, is negligible (0 seconds), as no specific time was provided for these actions.
    *   We assume the elevator starts from rest and ends at rest at the destination floors.

### **1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

**Step 1: Calculate the distance required to reach maximum speed.**
To reach $5 \text{ m/s}$ with an acceleration of $1 \text{ m/s}^2$:
$$t_{accel} = \frac{v_{max}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}$$
The distance covered during this acceleration:
$$d_{accel} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times t_{accel}^2 = 0.5 \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}$$

**Step 2: Calculate the distance required to decelerate to a stop.**
Since deceleration is also $1 \text{ m/s}^2$, the time and distance are the same as acceleration:
$$t_{decel} = 5 \text{ seconds}$$
$$d_{decel} = 12.5 \text{ meters}$$

**Step 3: Determine the motion profile.**
Total distance to travel = 200 meters.
Total distance needed for acceleration and deceleration = $12.5 + 12.5 = 25$ meters.
Since $25 \text{ m} < 200 \text{ m}$, the elevator will reach its maximum speed and cruise for a period of time.

**Step 4: Calculate the cruising distance and time.**
$$d_{cruise} = \text{Total Distance} - d_{accel} - d_{decel}$$
$$d_{cruise} = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 \text{ meters}$$
$$t_{cruise} = \frac{d_{cruise}}{v_{max}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds}$$

**Step 5: Calculate total time.**
$$t_{total} = t_{accel} + t_{cruise} + t_{decel}$$
$$t_{total} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds}$$

**Answer:** It takes **45 seconds** to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### **2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

We assume the elevator travels upwards, stopping at 10/F first, then 30/F. The total time is the sum of the travel time to 10/F and the travel time from 10/F to 30/F.

**Leg 1: Ground Floor (0m) to 10/F (50m)**

*   **Distance:** $10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ m/floor} = 50 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Acceleration/Deceleration Distance:** $12.5 \text{ m} + 12.5 \text{ m} = 25 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Check:** Since $25 \text{ m} < 50 \text{ m}$, the elevator reaches max speed.
*   **Cruise Distance:** $50 - 25 = 25 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Cruise Time:** $\frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ seconds}$.
*   **Total Time Leg 1:** $5 \text{ (accel)} + 5 \text{ (cruise)} + 5 \text{ (decel)} = 15 \text{ seconds}$.

**Leg 2: 10/F (50m) to 30/F (150m)**

*   **Distance:** $150 - 50 = 100 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Acceleration/Deceleration Distance:** $25 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Check:** Since $25 \text{ m} < 100 \text{ m}$, the elevator reaches max speed.
*   **Cruise Distance:** $100 - 25 = 75 \text{ meters}$.
*   **Cruise Time:** $\frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ seconds}$.
*   **Total Time Leg 2:** $5 \text{ (accel)} + 15 \text{ (cruise)} + 5 \text{ (decel)} = 25 \text{ seconds}$.

**Total Time:**
$$t_{total} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ seconds}$$

**Answer:** It takes **40 seconds** for the second person to reach the 30th floor (and 15 seconds for the first person to reach the 10th floor).

### **3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize the time to reach 40/F while making one intermediate stop, we must minimize the time lost by stopping. The time lost consists of the time spent decelerating to the stop and accelerating back up to speed.

The minimum time loss occurs if the intermediate stop is placed such that the elevator does not have time to reach maximum speed between the ground floor and the stop, or between the stop and the top floor. This is known as a "Short Trip" profile.

Let's analyze the motion if the stop is placed very close to the ground floor (e.g., 2/F or 3/F).

**Leg 1: Ground Floor to Intermediate Floor ($d_1$)**
For the elevator to stop at a floor without reaching max speed, the distance must be less than the distance required to accelerate and decelerate ($25\text{m}$).
Let's choose a distance $d_1 = 18 \text{ meters}$ (between 3/F and 4/F).
*   Motion: Accelerate for half the distance, Decelerate for half the distance.
*   $d_{accel} = 9\text{m}$.
*   Time to accelerate 9m: $9 = 0.5 \times 1 \times t^2 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{18} \approx 4.24 \text{ s}$.
*   Total time for Leg 1: $2 \times 4.24 = 8.49 \text{ s}$.

**Leg 2: Intermediate Floor to 40/F ($d_2$)**
*   Total distance = 200m. Remaining distance $d_2 = 200 - 18 = 182 \text{ meters}$.
*   Since $182\text{m} > 25\text{m}$, the elevator will reach max speed.
*   Distance for accel/decel = 25m.
*   Cruise distance = $182 - 25 = 157 \text{ meters}$.
*   Cruise time = $\frac{157}{5} = 31.4 \text{ seconds}$.
*   Total time for Leg 2: $5 \text{ (accel)} + 31.4 \text{ (cruise
