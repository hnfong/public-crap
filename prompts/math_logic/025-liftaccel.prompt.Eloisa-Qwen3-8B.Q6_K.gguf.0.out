Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. I need to be careful with the physics here, especially since the elevator has acceleration and deceleration phases. Let me start by recalling the basic equations of motion.

First, the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s. Then it travels at that constant speed until it needs to decelerate. The deceleration is also 1 m/s², so it's symmetric.

For the first question: going from ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Each floor is 5 meters, so the total distance is 40 floors * 5 m/floor = 200 meters.

I need to find the time taken. Let me break it down into acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration phases.

First, calculate the time to accelerate to max speed. Acceleration a = 1 m/s², final velocity v = 5 m/s. Using v = u + at, where u = 0 (starting from rest), so 5 = 0 + 1*t => t = 5 seconds. The distance covered during acceleration is s = ut + 0.5at² = 0 + 0.5*1*25 = 12.5 meters.

Same for deceleration: it will decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 at the top floor. So time to decelerate is also 5 seconds, and distance is 12.5 meters.

Now, the remaining distance is total distance minus acceleration and deceleration distances: 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters. At constant speed of 5 m/s, time is distance/speed = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

Total time is acceleration time + constant speed time + deceleration time = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

Wait, but is the elevator starting from rest and ending at rest? Yes, so the acceleration and deceleration phases are both 5 seconds each, and the constant speed phase is 35 seconds. So total 45 seconds. That seems straightforward.

Now, question 2: two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F, second to 30/F. How long does it take?

So the elevator needs to go from 1/F to 10/F, then to 30/F, then to 40/F? Wait, no. The first person gets off at 10/F, the second at 30/F. So the elevator goes from 1/F to 10/F, then continues to 30/F, then to 40/F? But the second person is going to 30/F, so the elevator should stop there. Wait, but the question is about the time it takes for the lift to get to the top floor, but with two people getting off at different floors. Wait, the question says: "How long does it take?" but it doesn't specify if the lift continues to the top or stops at the top. Wait, the first question was about going to the top floor, but here, the lift is going to 30/F and then presumably continues to 40/F? Or does it stop at 30/F and then go to 40/F? The question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the first person goes to 10/F, the second to 30/F. So the elevator starts at 1/F, goes to 10/F (first person gets off), then continues to 30/F (second person gets off), and then presumably continues to 40/F? But the question is "how long does it take?" but it doesn't specify the destination. Wait, looking back at the question: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?"

Hmm, the question is a bit unclear. Is it asking for the time to reach the top floor (40/F) with these two stops, or the time to reach the highest floor that someone is going to, which is 30/F? But the first question was about reaching 40/F, so maybe here it's about reaching 30/F? Or perhaps the lift continues to 40/F after dropping off the second person. But the question doesn't specify. Wait, the original question might be implying that the lift goes to the top floor, but with stops at 10/F and 30/F. But the first person is going to 10/F, so they get off there, and the second to 30/F, so they get off there, and then the lift continues to 40/F? But the question is "how long does it take?" without specifying the destination. This is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?"

I think the intended meaning is that the lift starts at 1/F, goes to 10/F (first person gets off), then continues to 30/F (second person gets off), and then presumably continues to 40/F? But the question is about the time it takes for the lift to get to the top floor (40/F), but with these stops. However, the first person is going to 10/F, so they don't need to go further, but the lift still needs to go to 30/F and then to 40/F. But the question is phrased as "how long does it take?" without specifying the destination. This is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the time to reach the highest floor that someone is going to, which is 30/F. But the first question was about reaching 40/F, so maybe here it's about reaching 30/F. But the problem says "how long does it take?" without specifying. This is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the lift stops at 10/F and 30/F, and then continues to 40/F, and the time is for the entire trip from 1/F to 40/F with these stops. But the question doesn't specify that. It just says "how long does it take?" for the lift to get from the ground floor to the top floor, but with two people getting off at different floors. Wait, no, the first question was about going from ground to top without stops, but here it's with stops. But the question is phrased as "how long does it take?" for the scenario where two people get on and go to different floors. So I think the intended meaning is that the lift starts at 1/F, goes to 10/F (first person gets off), then continues to 30/F (second person gets off), and then continues to 40/F. So the total time is from 1/F to 40/F with stops at 10/F and 30/F.

But the question is a bit unclear. Let me check the original problem again.

Original question 2: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?"

I think the answer is the time for the lift to go from 1/F to 40/F with stops at 10/F and 30/F. So I need to calculate the time for the elevator to accelerate, go at constant speed, decelerate, but with intermediate stops.

But when the elevator stops at a floor, it has to decelerate to stop, then accelerate again to continue. So each stop adds time for deceleration and acceleration.

So for the first part: from 1/F to 10/F.

First, the elevator starts from rest at 1/F. It accelerates to max speed, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates to stop at 10/F.

But wait, the distance to 10/F is 10 floors * 5 m/floor = 50 meters.

So, same as before: acceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Constant speed phase: distance remaining is 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters. At 5 m/s, time is 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds. Deceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Total time to reach 10/F: 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds.

But wait, when it decelerates to stop at 10/F, it needs to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0, which takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5 meters. So yes.

Now, after stopping at 10/F, the elevator needs to accelerate again to go to 30/F. So from rest at 10/F, it accelerates to 5 m/s, which takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5 meters. Then it travels at constant speed to 30/F.

Distance from 10/F to 30/F is 20 floors * 5 m/floor = 100 meters. But the elevator has already covered 12.5 meters during acceleration, so remaining distance is 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters. At 5 m/s, time is 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds. Then it needs to decelerate to stop at 30/F. Deceleration takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5 meters. So total time from 10/F to 30/F: acceleration (5s) + constant speed (17.5s) + deceleration (5s) = 27.5 seconds.

But wait, the distance from 10/F to 30/F is 100 meters. Acceleration covers 12.5 meters, constant speed covers 87.5 meters, deceleration covers 12.5 meters. Total 12.5 + 87.5 + 12.5 = 112.5 meters? Wait, that's more than 100 meters. That can't be right.

Ah, I see the mistake. When the elevator is going from 10/F to 30/F, it starts from rest at 10/F, accelerates to 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates to stop at 30/F. The total distance should be 100 meters.

Acceleration phase: 12.5 meters. Deceleration phase: 12.5 meters. So the constant speed phase should cover 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters. At 5 m/s, time is 75 / 5 = 15 seconds. Acceleration time is 5 seconds, deceleration time is 5 seconds. So total time from 10/F to 30/F is 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds.

Yes, that makes sense. Earlier I miscalculated the remaining distance after acceleration.

So from 10/F to 30/F: 25 seconds.

Now, after stopping at 30/F, the elevator needs to go to 40/F. Distance from 30/F to 40/F is 10 floors * 5 m/floor = 50 meters.

Same as the first part. Accelerate from rest: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Constant speed: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters, time 7.5 seconds. Decelerate: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Total time from 30/F to 40/F: 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds.

Now, total time from 1/F to 40/F with stops at 10/F and 30/F is the time to go from 1/F to 10/F (17.5s) plus time from 10/F to 30/F (25s) plus time from 30/F to 40/F (17.5s). But wait, when the elevator stops at 10/F and 30/F, it doesn't need to accelerate and decelerate again for each stop? Wait, no. When it stops at 10/F, it decelerates to stop, then from rest it accelerates again to go to 30/F. Similarly, at 30/F, it decelerates to stop, then accelerates again to go to 40/F.

So the total time is indeed the sum of the times for each segment: 17.5s (1/F to 10/F) + 25s (10/F to 30/F) + 17.5s (30/F to 40/F) = 60 seconds.

But wait, let me check the distances again to make sure.

From 1/F to 10/F: 50 meters. Acceleration: 12.5m, constant speed: 37.5m, deceleration: 12.5m. Total 50m. Time: 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5s.

From 10/F to 30/F: 100 meters. Acceleration: 12.5m, constant speed: 75m, deceleration: 12.5m. Total 100m. Time: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25s.

From 30/F to 40/F: 50 meters. Same as first segment: 17.5s.

Total distance: 50 + 100 + 50 = 200 meters, same as before. Total time: 17.5 + 25 + 17.5 = 60 seconds.

But in the first question, without stops, it was 45 seconds. With stops, it's longer, which makes sense.

Now, question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

So the lift needs to go from 1/F to 40/F, but it has to stop at another floor (not 40/F) on the way. The first person is going to 40/F, so they get off there. The second person is going to some other floor, say floor X (between 1/F and 40/F), so the lift stops at X and then continues to 40/F.

The question is to find the minimum time for the lift to reach 40/F, given that it must stop at another floor. So we need to choose the optimal floor X to minimize the total time.

The total time will depend on where X is. The elevator will accelerate, go at constant speed, decelerate to stop at X, then accelerate again, go at constant speed, decelerate to stop at 40/F.

But since the elevator is going to 40/F, and it has to stop at X, the total distance is still 200 meters, but with an intermediate stop.

To minimize the time, we need to minimize the time spent accelerating and decelerating, because those phases are at lower speeds. So ideally, we want to minimize the number of acceleration and deceleration phases, but since there's a stop at X, there will be two acceleration and two deceleration phases (start, stop at X, start again, stop at 40/F).

But the time for acceleration and deceleration depends on the distance covered during those phases. The acceleration and deceleration phases each cover 12.5 meters (since a=1m/s², v=5m/s, t=5s, s=0.5*1*25=12.5m).

So for each acceleration and deceleration, it takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5 meters.

Now, the total distance is 200 meters. The elevator will cover some distance during acceleration, constant speed, deceleration, then again acceleration, constant speed, deceleration.

Let me denote:

- First segment: from 1/F to X. Distance d1 = (X - 1) * 5 meters.

- Second segment: from X to 40/F. Distance d2 = (40 - X) * 5 meters.

For each segment, the elevator will accelerate, go at constant speed, decelerate.

For the first segment (1/F to X):

- Acceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds.

- Constant speed: d1 - 12.5 meters, time = (d1 - 12.5)/5 seconds.

- Deceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds.

Total time for first segment: 5 + (d1 - 12.5)/5 + 5 = 10 + (d1 - 12.5)/5 seconds.

Similarly, for the second segment (X to 40/F):

- Acceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds.

- Constant speed: d2 - 12.5 meters, time = (d2 - 12.5)/5 seconds.

- Deceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds.

Total time for second segment: 10 + (d2 - 12.5)/5 seconds.

Total time T = [10 + (d1 - 12.5)/5] + [10 + (d2 - 12.5)/5] = 20 + [(d1 + d2) - 25]/5

But d1 + d2 = total distance = 200 meters.

So T = 20 + [(200 - 25)/5] = 20 + (175/5) = 20 + 35 = 55 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. The total time is 55 seconds regardless of where X is, as long as the elevator stops at X and then goes to 40/F. But that can't be right, because if X is very close to 1/F, say X=2/F, then the elevator would accelerate, decelerate quickly, then accelerate again, which might take more time. But according to this calculation, it's always 55 seconds.

Let me check with an example. Suppose X is 2/F. Then d1 = (2-1)*5 = 5 meters.

First segment: from 1/F to 2/F.

Acceleration: 12.5 meters, but the distance is only 5 meters. Wait, that's a problem. The elevator can't accelerate for 12.5 meters if the distance is only 5 meters. So my assumption that the elevator always accelerates to max speed is incorrect if the distance is too short.

Ah, right! I forgot that if the distance is less than the distance required for acceleration and deceleration, the elevator might not reach max speed.

So in this case, for short distances, the elevator will accelerate, then decelerate before reaching max speed, or even not decelerate if the distance is very short.

So my previous calculation is only valid if the distance for each segment is at least 12.5 meters (the distance covered during acceleration/deceleration). But for the first segment, if X is close to 1/F, d1 might be less than 12.5 meters, so the elevator won't reach max speed.

Similarly for the second segment.

Therefore, to find the minimum time, we need to consider the optimal X where the elevator can reach max speed in both segments, or at least minimize the time.

But the question is to find the minimum time for the lift to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor. So we need to choose X such that the total time is minimized.

Let me think about the total time.

The elevator starts from rest at 1/F. It accelerates until it reaches max speed or until it needs to decelerate to stop at X. Then it decelerates to stop at X. Then it accelerates again to max speed (if possible) and then decelerates to stop at 40/F.

But the time depends on the distance between the floors.

Let me define the distance from 1/F to X as d1 = 5*(X-1) meters.

Similarly, from X to 40/F is d2 = 5*(40 - X) meters.

Total distance d1 + d2 = 200 meters.

Now, for the first segment (1/F to X):

The elevator will accelerate until it reaches max speed or until it needs to decelerate. The time to accelerate to max speed is 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. If d1 >= 12.5 meters, then it will accelerate to max speed, then decelerate to stop at X. The deceleration distance is 12.5 meters, so the constant speed distance is d1 - 12.5 - 12.5 = d1 - 25 meters. Time for constant speed is (d1 - 25)/5 seconds. Total time for first segment: 5 (accel) + (d1 - 25)/5 + 5 (decel) = 10 + (d1 - 25)/5 seconds.

If d1 < 12.5 meters, then the elevator will accelerate and decelerate without reaching max speed. The time to accelerate and decelerate is such that the total distance is d1. The acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, so the time to accelerate and decelerate is 2*t, where t is the time to accelerate to a speed v, and v^2 = 2*a*s, but since it's stopping, the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is d1. Since acceleration and deceleration are equal, the distance covered during acceleration is d1/2, and the speed at the end of acceleration is v = sqrt(2*a*(d1/2)) = sqrt(a*d1). Then the time to accelerate is t = v/a = sqrt(a*d1)/a = sqrt(d1/a). Similarly for deceleration. Total time for first segment is 2*sqrt(d1/a).

But a = 1 m/s², so time = 2*sqrt(d1) seconds.

Similarly for the second segment.

But this complicates things because we have to consider different cases based on the value of d1 and d2.

To minimize the total time, we need to choose X such that the elevator can reach max speed in both segments, which would minimize the time spent in acceleration and deceleration phases.

The maximum speed is 5 m/s, which requires 5 seconds of acceleration. So for the elevator to reach max speed in a segment, the distance of that segment must be at least the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. Wait, no. To reach max speed, the elevator needs to accelerate for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. Then it can travel at constant speed. But to decelerate, it needs another 12.5 meters. So for the elevator to reach max speed and then decelerate, the total distance must be at least 25 meters. But if the distance is less than 25 meters, it won't reach max speed.

So for the first segment (1/F to X), if d1 >= 25 meters, then the elevator can accelerate to max speed, travel at constant speed, then decelerate to stop at X. Time is 10 + (d1 - 25)/5 seconds.

If d1 < 25 meters, then the elevator will accelerate and decelerate without reaching max speed. Time is 2*sqrt(d1) seconds.

Similarly for the second segment (X to 40/F), if d2 >= 25 meters, time is 10 + (d2 - 25)/5 seconds. If d2 < 25 meters, time is 2*sqrt(d2) seconds.

Now, the total time T = time for first segment + time for second segment.

We need to minimize T by choosing X (i.e., d1 and d2, with d1 + d2 = 200).

But since d1 and d2 are related (d2 = 200 - d1), we can express T as a function of d1.

However, the function T(d1) will have different expressions depending on whether d1 >= 25 and d2 >= 25, or not.

First, note that d1 ranges from 0 to 200 meters (but since X is between 1/F and 40/F, d1 is from 0 to 195 meters, but practically, X can be 1/F or 40/F, but the problem says "another floor between 1/F and 40/F", so X ≠ 1/F and X ≠ 40/F, so d1 > 0 and d2 > 0.

But for the minimum time, we can consider the boundaries.

Now, the critical points are when d1 = 25 meters or d2 = 25 meters.

If d1 >= 25 and d2 >= 25, then T = [10 + (d1 - 25)/5] + [10 + (d2 - 25)/5] = 20 + (d1 + d2 - 50)/5 = 20 + (200 - 50)/5 = 20 + 150/5 = 20 + 30 = 50 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. If both segments are at least 25 meters, then the total time is 50 seconds, regardless of d1 and d2, as long as d1 + d2 = 200 and both >=25.

But is that possible? Let me check with an example.

Suppose d1 = 25 meters, d2 = 175 meters.

First segment: d1 = 25 meters. Since d1 = 25, which is exactly the distance for acceleration and deceleration (12.5 + 12.5). So the elevator accelerates for 5 seconds, covers 12.5 meters, then decelerates for 5 seconds, covers another 12.5 meters, stopping at X. No constant speed phase. Time for first segment: 5 + 5 = 10 seconds.

Second segment: d2 = 175 meters. Since d2 >=25, time is 10 + (175 - 25)/5 = 10 + 150/5 = 10 + 30 = 40 seconds.

Total time: 10 + 40 = 50 seconds.

Another example: d1 = 50 meters, d2 = 150 meters.

First segment: d1 = 50 >=25. Time: 10 + (50 - 25)/5 = 10 + 25/5 = 10 + 5 = 15 seconds.

Second segment: d2 = 150 >=25. Time: 10 + (150 - 25)/5 = 10 + 125/5 = 10 + 25 = 35 seconds.

Total: 15 + 35 = 50 seconds.

Same result.

Now, what if one of the segments is less than 25 meters?

Suppose d1 = 20 meters (less than 25), d2 = 180 meters.

First segment: d1 = 20 <25. Time: 2*sqrt(20) ≈ 2*4.472 = 8.944 seconds.

Second segment: d2 = 180 >=25. Time: 10 + (180 - 25)/5 = 10 + 155/5 = 10 + 31 = 41 seconds.

Total time: 8.944 + 41 ≈ 49.944 seconds, which is slightly less than 50 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. So when one segment is shorter than 25 meters, the total time is less than 50 seconds.

But in this case, d1 = 20 meters, which is 4 floors (since each floor is 5 meters, 20/5=4 floors). So X is 1/F + 4 floors = 5/F.

Then d2 = 180 meters = 36 floors, so from 5/F to 40/F is 35 floors, which is 175 meters? Wait, no. From X=5/F to 40/F is 40 - 5 = 35 floors, each 5 meters, so 175 meters. But earlier I said d2=180, which is inconsistent.

Wait, d1 + d2 = 200. If d1=20, d2=180. But d1 is from 1/F to X, d2 from X to 40/F. So total distance is d1 + d2 = 200. But if X is 5/F, then d1 = 5*4 = 20 meters (from 1/F to 5/F is 4 floors, 20 meters). Then d2 = 200 - 20 = 180 meters. From 5/F to 40/F is 35 floors, which is 175 meters. Wait, 35*5=175, not 180. So there's a discrepancy.

Ah, I see. The total distance from 1/F to 40/F is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters. So if X is at floor k, then d1 = 5*(k - 1) meters, d2 = 5*(40 - k) meters. So d1 + d2 = 5*(k - 1) + 5*(40 - k) = 5*(k - 1 + 40 - k) = 5*39 = 195 meters. Wait, that's not 200. Wait, no. From 1/F to 40/F is 39 floors between them, but including both floors, it's 40 floors. The distance is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters. But if you go from 1/F to X (floor k), that's (k - 1) floors, so distance 5*(k - 1) meters. From X to 40/F is (40 - k) floors, distance 5*(40 - k) meters. Total distance is 5*(k - 1) + 5*(40 - k) = 5*(k - 1 + 40 - k) = 5*39 = 195 meters. But the total distance from 1/F to 40/F is 200 meters. Wait, this is a problem.

Ah, I think I made a mistake here. The floors are 1/F to 40/F, so the number of floors between 1/F and 40/F is 39 floors, but the distance is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor? No, that's incorrect.

Let me clarify: the building has 40 floors, each floor is 5 meters tall. So the distance from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) is the height of 39 floors, because the floors are between the levels. Wait, no. Typically, the height of the building is the distance from the ground floor to the top floor. If each floor is 5 meters tall, then the distance from 1/F to 2/F is 5 meters, from 1/F to 3/F is 10 meters, ..., from 1/F to 40/F is 39 * 5 = 195 meters. But the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall", and "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)", so the total distance is 39 floors * 5 meters = 195 meters.

But in the first question, I assumed 40 floors * 5 meters = 200 meters, which is incorrect. That was a mistake.

Let me correct that.

Each floor is 5 meters tall. So the distance from 1/F to 2/F is 5 meters, from 1/F to 3/F is 10 meters, ..., from 1/F to 40/F is 39 * 5 = 195 meters.

Similarly, from 1/F to 10/F is 9 floors * 5 = 45 meters.

From 10/F to 30/F is 20 floors * 5 = 100 meters.

From 30/F to 40/F is 10 floors * 5 = 50 meters.

Total distance from 1/F to 40/F is 195 meters.

So my previous calculations were wrong because I used 200 meters instead of 195 meters.

Let me redo the first question with the correct distance.

Question 1: From 1/F to 40/F, distance 195 meters.

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Constant speed distance: 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170 meters.

Time at constant speed: 170 / 5 = 34 seconds.

Total time: 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds.

Previously I had 45 seconds, now 44 seconds.

Question 2: Two people, first to 10/F, second to 30/F.

Distance from 1/F to 10/F: 9 floors * 5 = 45 meters.

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Constant speed: 45 - 12.5 = 32.5 meters, time 32.5 / 5 = 6.5 seconds.

Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Total time to 10/F: 5 + 6.5 + 5 = 16.5 seconds.

From 10/F to 30/F: 20 floors * 5 = 100 meters.

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Constant speed: 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters, time 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds.

Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Total time from 10/F to 30/F: 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds.

From 30/F to 40/F: 10 floors * 5 = 50 meters.

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Constant speed: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters, time 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds.

Deceleration:
