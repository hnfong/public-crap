I'll solve each question step by step.

**Given information:**
- Building: 40 stories, each 5 meters tall = 200 meters total height
- Acceleration/deceleration: 1 m/s²
- Maximum speed: 5 m/s

**Step 1: Calculate the acceleration/deceleration distance**

At maximum speed of 5 m/s with acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s²:
- Time to reach max speed: t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds
- Distance covered during acceleration: d = ½at² = ½(1)(25) = 12.5 meters
- Distance covered during deceleration: same as acceleration = 12.5 meters
- Distance at constant speed: 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters

**Step 2: Calculate time for full journey**

- Time accelerating: 5 seconds
- Time at constant speed: 175/5 = 35 seconds
- Time decelerating: 5 seconds
- Total time: 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from ground floor to top floor?**

Answer: 45 seconds

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

First, I need to find the heights:
- 10/F: 10 × 5 = 50 meters
- 30/F: 30 × 5 = 150 meters

The lift will:
1. Go from 0 to 50 meters (10/F) - this is a shorter journey
2. Then go from 50 to 150 meters (30/F) - this is the remaining journey

For the first journey (0 to 50 meters):
- Distance = 50 meters
- Since 50 < 25 (acceleration + deceleration distance), it won't reach max speed
- Let's find the distance needed to reach max speed: 12.5 meters
- Distance to accelerate to max speed: 12.5 meters
- Distance to decelerate from max speed: 12.5 meters
- Total distance for acceleration/deceleration: 25 meters
- Remaining distance at max speed: 50 - 25 = 25 meters

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully.

For a journey of 50 meters:
- Distance needed for acceleration/deceleration: 25 meters total
- Since 50 > 25, it will reach maximum speed
- Time to accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds
- Time to decelerate from max speed: 5 seconds
- Time at constant speed: (50 - 25)/5 = 5 seconds
- Total time for first leg: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 seconds

For the second journey (50 to 150 meters, 100 meters total):
- Distance = 100 meters
- Since 100 > 25, it will reach maximum speed
- Time to accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds
- Time to decelerate from max speed: 5 seconds
- Time at constant speed: (100 - 25)/5 = 15 seconds
- Total time for second leg: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds

Total time: 15 + 25 = 40 seconds

**Question 2 Answer: 40 seconds**

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize time, we want to maximize the time spent at maximum speed.

The lift needs to go from 0 to 200 meters, but must stop at some intermediate floor.

The optimal strategy is to go to the highest floor that allows maximum speed usage, then go to 40/F.

Let's say it stops at floor n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 39).
- Distance to floor n: 5n meters
- Distance from floor n to 40/F: 200 - 5n meters

For maximum efficiency, we want to minimize the number of stops that prevent maximum speed usage.

The minimum time occurs when we make one stop that minimizes the time penalty.

Let's consider stopping at floor 20 (100 meters):
- Go from 0 to 100 meters: 
  - Accelerate 12.5m, go at max speed 75m, decelerate 12.5m
  - Time = 5 + 75/5 + 5 = 20 seconds
- Go from 100 to 200 meters:
  - Accelerate 12.5m, go at max speed 75m, decelerate 12.5m
  - Time = 5 + 75/5 + 5 = 20 seconds
- Total = 40 seconds

But we want to minimize the total time, so we should consider stopping at a floor that allows us to use maximum speed for the longest distance.

Actually, let's think differently. The minimum time is achieved when we make the stop at a floor that minimizes the total time.

The best approach is to go to floor 39 (195m) and then to 40/F (5m):
- Go from 0 to 195m:
  - Distance = 195m
  - Since 195 > 25, it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 (accel) + (195-25)/5 (constant) + 5 (decel) = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds
- Go from 195 to 200m (5m):
  - Distance = 5m < 25m, so it doesn't reach max speed
  - Time = 2.5 (accel) + 2.5 (decel) = 5 seconds
- Total = 44 + 5 = 49 seconds

Let's try stopping at floor 30 (150m):
- Go from 0 to 150m:
  - Distance = 150m > 25m, so it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 + (150-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 seconds
- Go from 150 to 200m (50m):
  - Distance = 50m > 25m, so it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 + (50-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 seconds
- Total = 35 + 15 = 50 seconds

Let's try stopping at floor 10 (50m):
- Go from 0 to 50m:
  - Distance = 50m > 25m, so it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 + (50-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 seconds
- Go from 50 to 200m (150m):
  - Distance = 150m > 25m, so it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 + (150-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 seconds
- Total = 15 + 35 = 50 seconds

Wait, I need to reconsider the optimal strategy. The minimum time is when we make the stop at the floor that minimizes the total journey time.

Actually, the minimum time is when we make the stop at floor 39 (195m) and then go to 40/F:
- Go from 0 to 195m: 44 seconds (as calculated above)
- Go from 195 to 200m: 5 seconds (as calculated above)
- Total: 49 seconds

But let's check if we can do better by stopping at floor 1 (5m):
- Go from 0 to 5m: 
  - Distance = 5m < 25m, so no max speed reached
  - Time = 2.5 (accel) + 2.5 (decel) = 5 seconds
- Go from 5 to 200m (195m):
  - Distance = 195m > 25m, so it reaches max speed
  - Time = 5 + (195-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds
- Total = 5 + 44 = 49 seconds

The minimum time is 49 seconds.
