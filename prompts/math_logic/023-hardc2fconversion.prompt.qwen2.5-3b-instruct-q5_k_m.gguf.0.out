The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not a standard or accurate way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Let's break this down and provide a more accurate method for conversion.

### Standard Conversion Formula
The formula to convert Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) is:
\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

### Example Conversion
Let's convert 12°C to Fahrenheit:
\[ F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6 \]
So, 12°C is 53.6°F.

### Inverting Digits
Now, let's look at the digits of 53.6:
- The digits are 5 and 3.
- Inverting these digits gives 3 and 5.

### Inverted Digits Example
Let's take another example, say 25°C:
\[ F = \frac{9}{5} \times 25 + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77 \]
So, 25°C is 77°F.

### Inverting Digits
Now, let's look at the digits of 77:
- The digits are 7 and 7.
- Inverting these digits gives 7 and 7.

### Analysis of the Statement
The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not a reliable method for conversion. It does not hold true for many temperatures and does not follow a consistent pattern. The digits do not invert in a systematic way for every 12°C.

### Conclusion
The statement is not accurate and should not be used for conversion. The standard method is to use the formula \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \). [end of text]
