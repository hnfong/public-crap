◁think▷Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

Q1: 1+1=? That's easy. The answer is 2.

Q2: 6*7=? I remember my multiplication tables. 6 times 7 is 42.

Q3: 83*59=? Hmm, that's a bit more challenging. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 83 multiplied by 59. First, 83 * 50 is 4150, and 83 * 9 is 747. Adding those together gives 4150 + 747 = 4897. So the answer is 4897.

Q4: 349*683=? This is a larger multiplication. Let me break it down. 349 * 683 can be calculated by multiplying each part. Maybe using the distributive property: 349 * (600 + 80 + 3) = 349*600 + 349*80 + 349*3. Let's compute each term. 349*600 is 209400. 349*80 is 27920. 349*3 is 1047. Adding them up: 209400 + 27920 = 237320, then plus 1047 gives 238367. So the answer is 238367.

Q5: 6043*7489=? Wow, that's a big one. Maybe I can use a calculator for this, but since I'm supposed to reason through it, let's try. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to approximate. But given the time constraints, maybe I should just multiply them. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 6043 * 7489. Let's use long multiplication. Starting with 6043 multiplied by 9 is 54387. Then 6043 * 80 is 483440. Then 6043 * 400 is 2417200. Then 6043 * 7000 is 42301000. Adding all these together: 54387 + 483440 = 537827. Then 537827 + 2417200 = 2955027. Then 2955027 + 42301000 = 45256027. So the answer is 45256027.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. Let's isolate x. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide by 3: x = 5. So the answer is x=5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% is the same as 1/4. So 80 divided by 4 is 20. The answer is 20.

Q8: The book costs $15. The user gives two $20 bills (total $40) and an additional $5 bill, making $45. The change should be $45 - $15 = $30. So the answer is $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The perimeter is 4 times the side length. 4*5=20. So the answer is 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine is a child herself, plus two brothers and one sister. So total children: 1 (Katherine) + 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) = 4. So the answer is 4.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷ 4 is 3. Then 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So the answer is 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Assuming each guest gets one slice, and Tom might also have a slice. But the question doesn't specify if Tom is included. The problem says "5 guests have arrived", so maybe 5 slices. But perhaps the cake is cut into more slices. Without more info, the answer is likely 5 slices. So the answer is 5.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? 20% of $25 is $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20. The answer is $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? From 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes. From 4:00 to 6:00 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. From 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes. Adding them up: 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes. So the answer is 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? 22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up to 6 taxis. So the answer is 6.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. The answer is 87 degrees.
