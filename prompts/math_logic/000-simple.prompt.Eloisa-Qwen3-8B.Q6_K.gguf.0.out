Okay, let's go through each question one by one. Starting with Q1: 1+1. That's straightforward, it's 2. Q2: 6*7. Six times seven is 42. Q3: 83*59. Hmm, I need to calculate that. Let me do 80*60 first, which is 4800, but since it's 83 and 59, I should adjust. 83*60 is 4980, minus 83 gives 4897. Wait, no, 59 is 60-1, so 83*59 = 83*(60-1) = 83*60 - 83 = 4980 - 83 = 4897. Yeah, that's right. Q4: 349*683. This is getting bigger. Maybe break it down. 349*700 is 244,300, but 683 is 700-17, so 349*683 = 349*(700-17) = 349*700 - 349*17. 349*700 is 244,300. 349*17: 300*17=5,100, 49*17=833, so 5,100+833=5,933. Subtract that from 244,300: 244,300 - 5,933 = 238,367. Wait, let me check that again. 244,300 minus 5,933. 244,300 - 5,000 = 239,300, then minus 933 is 238,367. Okay. Q5: 6043*7489. Wow, that's a big multiplication. Maybe use a calculator, but since I can't, I'll have to do it step by step. Alternatively, I can approximate, but the user probably wants the exact answer. Let me try breaking it down. 6043*7000 = 42,301,000. 6043*400 = 2,417,200. 6043*80 = 483,440. 6043*9 = 54,387. Now add them all up: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200. Then +483,440 = 45,201,640. Then +54,387 = 45,256,027. Wait, let me check the addition again. 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640. Then 45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027. Okay, that seems right. Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5. Q7: 25% of 80. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25*80 = 20. Q8: The book costs $15. I give two $20 bills, so $40. The shopkeeper doesn't have change, so I give an additional $5. So total given is $45. The book is $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30. But the shopkeeper doesn't have exact change initially, but after giving the extra $5, she should have enough to give back $30. Wait, the question is what is the final change. So yes, $30. Q9: Perimeter of a square with side 5 units. Perimeter is 4*side, so 4*5 = 20 units. Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. So her brothers and sister are siblings. Katherine herself is a child, so total children: two brothers + one sister + Katherine = 4 children. Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. Q12: Tom's party, 5 guests arrived. How many cake slices? Typically, one slice per person, so 5 slices. But maybe it's a standard cake, but the question doesn't specify, so probably 5. Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. 20% of 25 is 5, so sale price is 25 - 5 = $20. Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM. How many minutes until 6:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But we need until 6:30, which is 15 minutes less. So 180 - 15 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, from 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes, 4:00 to 6:00 is 120 minutes, 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes. Total 15+120+30=165. Q15: Taxi carries 4 passengers. 22 people. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, so need 6 taxis. Q16: Triangle with angles 31 and 62. Sum of angles is 180, so third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
