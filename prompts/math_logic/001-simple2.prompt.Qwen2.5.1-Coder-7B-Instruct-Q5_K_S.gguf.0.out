Q1: The number 120 is significant in several areas of mathematics and has several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5!), which means it is the product of all positive integers up to 5: 120 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.

2. **Divisors**: It has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

3. **Perfect Number**: 120 is a perfect number, meaning the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) equals the number itself: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 120.

4. **Harmonic Divisors**: It is a harmonic divisor number, which means the harmonic mean of its divisors is an integer.

5. **Triangular Number**: 120 is a triangular number, which can be represented as the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120.

6. **Catalan Number**: 120 is the 5th Catalan number, which appears in various combinatorial problems.

Q2: To solve the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

For the given equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \). Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we first calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time for one one-way trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \]

A round trip consists of two one-way trips:

\[ \text{Round trip time} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \]

A full day is 24 hours. To find out how many round trips can be made in a day:

\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/round trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips in a full day. [end of text]
