Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. The number 120 has several interesting properties:
   - It is an even composite number, with the prime factorization of 2^3 * 3 * 5.
   - It is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3).
   - It is a Catalan number, which appears in various counting problems in combinatorics.
   - It is a pronic number, as it is the product of two consecutive integers (12 * 10).
   - It is a sphenic number, which means it is the product of three distinct prime numbers.

2. To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it:
   (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
   x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2
   So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

3. To find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip. Since the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h and the distance between the two cities is 200 km, the time for one way is:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)
   For a round trip, we double this time:
   Round trip time = 3.33 hours * 2 = 6.67 hours (approximately)
   There are 24 hours in a full day, so the number of round trips is:
   Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours (approximately) = 3.6 (approximately)
   Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day.
