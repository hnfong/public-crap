We are given a 40-story building where:

- Each floor is **5 meters** tall.
- The elevator starts at **1/F (ground floor)** and goes to **40/F (top floor)**.
- Acceleration and deceleration: **1 m/s²**
- Maximum speed: **5 m/s**
- We assume the elevator stops at a floor only if someone gets on/off, and stopping takes **zero time** (unless otherwise specified — we'll assume instantaneous stops unless stated).

Let’s solve each question step by step.

---

### **Step 0: Understand elevator motion**

The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² up to a max speed of 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop.

Let’s compute the **time and distance to reach max speed**.

#### Time to reach max speed:
$$
v = at \Rightarrow t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
$$

#### Distance covered during acceleration:
$$
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
$$

Same for deceleration: 12.5 meters to stop.

So, for any trip:
- If the total distance is **less than 25 meters** (12.5 + 12.5), the elevator **never reaches max speed**.
- If the distance is **≥ 25 meters**, it accelerates (12.5 m), cruises at 5 m/s, then decelerates (12.5 m).

### **Question 1: How long to go from 1/F to 40/F?**

Total height = (40 - 1) floors × 5 m/floor = 39 × 5 = **195 meters**

Check: 195 > 25 → elevator reaches max speed.

- Acceleration phase: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Deceleration phase: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Cruise phase: 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170 meters at 5 m/s

Time at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \text{ seconds}
$$

Total time:
$$
5 + 34 + 5 = \boxed{44} \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ **Answer 1: 44 seconds**

### **Question 2: Two people get on at ground floor. First to 10/F, second to 30/F. How long does it take?**

We are to find the **total time for the elevator to reach 30/F**, since the second person gets off there. The first person gets off at 10/F, so the elevator stops at 10/F.

But the question is: **How long does it take?** — likely meaning how long until the **second person reaches 30/F**, since both started at the same time.

So the elevator:
- Starts at 1/F
- Stops at 10/F (first person exits)
- Continues to 30/F (second person exits)

We assume **instantaneous stops** (no time lost at stops), so we just compute the total time from 1/F to 30/F, **with a stop at 10/F**.

But does the stop affect the motion profile?

Yes — because the elevator must **stop at 10/F**, so it must decelerate to stop there, then re-accelerate to go to 30/F.

So we must break the journey into two segments:
1. 1/F → 10/F
2. 10/F → 30/F

We compute time for each, assuming the elevator comes to a full stop at 10/F.

---

#### **Segment 1: 1/F to 10/F**

Number of floors ascended: 10 - 1 = 9 floors  
Height: 9 × 5 = **45 meters**

Check if max speed is reached:
- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Total for accel/decel: 25 m < 45 m → yes, reaches max speed.

So:
- Accelerate: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Decelerate: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Cruise: 45 - 25 = 20 m at 5 m/s → time = 20 / 5 = 4 s

Total time for segment 1: 5 + 4 + 5 = **14 seconds**

---

#### **Segment 2: 10/F to 30/F**

Floors: 30 - 10 = 20 floors  
Height: 20 × 5 = **100 meters**

Again, 100 > 25 → reaches max speed.

- Accelerate: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Decelerate: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Cruise: 100 - 25 = 75 m → time = 75 / 5 = 15 s

Total time for segment 2: 5 + 15 + 5 = **25 seconds**

---

#### **Total time:**

Time from 1/F to 30/F with stop at 10/F:
$$
14 + 25 = \boxed{39} \text{ seconds}
$$

Note: We assume **no waiting time** at 10/F — the stop is instantaneous.

✅ **Answer 2: 39 seconds**

---

### **Question 3: Two people get on at ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Second person goes to some other floor (≠ 40/F). The lift must stop at one other floor between 1/F and 40/F. What is the minimum time for the lift to reach 40/F?**

We are to **minimize the total time to reach 40/F**, given that:
- The elevator **must stop at one intermediate floor** (where the second person gets off)
- The second person does **not** go to 40/F
- We can **choose** which floor the second person gets off at, to **minimize** the total time to 40/F

So we want to pick the **intermediate floor** (say floor $ k $, where $ 2 \leq k \leq 39 $) such that the total time from 1/F → k/F → 40/F is **minimized**.

We need to compute total time as a function of $ k $, then minimize it.

Let’s define:
- $ d_1 $: distance from 1/F to k/F = $ (k - 1) \times 5 $ meters
- $ d_2 $: distance from k/F to 40/F = $ (40 - k) \times 5 $ meters

For each segment, the elevator:
- Accelerates from rest (at start or after stop)
- May cruise
- Decelerates to stop (at k/F or 40/F)

So each segment has its own acceleration, cruise, deceleration.

Total time = time(1 → k) + time(k → 40)

We need to compute time for each segment based on distance.

Recall:
- To accelerate to 5 m/s: 5 s, 12.5 m
- To decelerate: 5 s, 12.5 m
- If distance $ d \geq 25 $ m: time = $ 5 + \frac{d - 25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} $
- If $ d < 25 $ m: the elevator doesn’t reach max speed. It accelerates and then immediately decelerates.

Let’s derive time for a segment of distance $ d $:
