Here are the answers to your questions:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

* **Significance:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. This makes it appear frequently in various mathematical contexts.

* **Interesting Properties:**
    * **Divisibility:** 120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
    * **Factorial:** 120 is 5! (5 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 5 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).
    * **Geometric Shapes:** 120 degrees is the measure of each interior angle of a regular hexagon.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

* **Quadratic Formula:** For an equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by:

   x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

* **Applying the Formula:**
    * a = 1, b = -7, c = -18
    * x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * -18)) / (2 * 1)
    * x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
    * x = (7 ± √121) / 2
    * x = (7 ± 11) / 2

* **Solutions:**
    * x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 9
    * x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -2

**Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

* **Time for one round trip:**
    * Time = Distance / Speed
    * Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

* **Round trips in a day:**
    * Hours in a day = 24
    * Round trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours/trip = 7.2 trips (approximately)

Since the train can't make a partial round trip, it can complete **7 full round trips** within a day.
