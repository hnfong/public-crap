### Q1: Significance and interesting properties of the number 120

**Significance:**
- 120 is a highly composite number (HCN), meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It is also the smallest number with 16 divisors.
- It is the factorial of 5 (5! = 120), which is the product of all positive integers up to 5.
- In mathematics, 120 appears in various contexts, such as in combinatorics (e.g., the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects is 5! = 120) and in geometry (e.g., the sum of angles in a pentagon is 540°, but each interior angle in a regular pentagon is 108°, and 120° is a common angle in polyhedra like the dodecahedron).

**Interesting properties:**
1. **Divisors:** 120 has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
2. **Triangular number:** 120 is the 15th triangular number (since 1+2+...+15 = 120).
3. **Tetrahedral number:** 120 is the 5th tetrahedral number (since it represents the number of spheres in a tetrahedral stack of 5 layers).
4. **Highly composite:** It is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors and the smallest number with more than 8 divisors.
5. **Sum of twin primes:** 120 is the sum of twin prime pairs (59 + 61 = 120).
6. **In time:** There are 120 minutes in 2 hours, and 120 seconds in 2 minutes (though this is less mathematical, it's a common reference).
7. **In religion and culture:** 120 is mentioned in the Bible as the age of Moses when he died (Deuteronomy 34:7), and in some cultures, it is considered a symbol of a full life span.

### Q2: Solve the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the quadratic equation:** \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \).
2. **Factor the quadratic:** We need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.
   - The pairs of factors of -18 are: (1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6).
   - The pair that adds to -7 is (-9, 2) because -9 + 2 = -7.
   - So, we factor as: \( (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0 \).
3. **Solve for x:**
   - Set each factor equal to zero:
     - \( x - 9 = 0 \) → \( x = 9 \)
     - \( x + 2 = 0 \) → \( x = -2 \)
4. **Check the solutions:**
   - For \( x = 9 \): \( 9^2 - 7*9 - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 \).
   - For \( x = -2 \): \( (-2)^2 - 7*(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 \).
   - Both solutions are valid.

**Answer:** The solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: Round trips of a train in a full day

**Given:**
- Average speed: 60 km/h
- Distance between cities: 200 km (one way)
- Time stationed in cities: negligible
- Full day: 24 hours

**Steps:**
1. **Calculate time for one one-way trip:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = \( \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.333 \) hours.
2. **Calculate time for one round trip:**
   - A round trip is 400 km (200 km each way).
   - Time for round trip = 400 km / 60 km/h = \( \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.667 \) hours.
3. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**
   - Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip = 24 / \( \frac{20}{3} \) = 24 * \( \frac{3}{20} \) = \( \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \).
4. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we take the integer part. However, note that the train can complete 3 full round trips and then start a fourth one-way trip (but not complete it). The question asks for "round trips", so we consider only complete round trips.
   - But wait: the train can make 3 full round trips (which take 3 * 6.667 = 20 hours) and then have 4 hours left. In 4 hours, it can travel 60 km/h * 4 h = 240 km. Since the distance to the other city is 200 km, it can complete one one-way trip (200 km) in 3.333 hours, leaving 0.667 hours (40 minutes) to spare. However, this one-way trip does not complete a round trip. Therefore, the number of complete round trips is 3.

**Alternative approach:**
- Total distance the train can travel in 24 hours: 60 km/h * 24 h = 1440 km.
- Distance per round trip: 400 km.
- Number of round trips: 1440 / 400 = 3.6 → but again, only complete round trips count, so 3.

**Answer:** The train can make 3 complete round trips in a full day. [end of text]
