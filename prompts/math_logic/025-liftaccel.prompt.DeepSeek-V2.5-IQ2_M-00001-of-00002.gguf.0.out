There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?
Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

First, let's calculate the total height of the building:
\[ \text{Total height} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of 5 m/s, travels at that speed for some time, and then decelerates to a stop. We need to break this into three phases: acceleration, cruising at maximum speed, and deceleration.

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of 5 m/s.
   - The time taken to reach maximum speed:
     \[ t_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
   - The distance covered during acceleration:
     \[ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

2. **Cruising Phase:**
   - The distance covered at maximum speed:
     \[ d_2 = \text{Total height} - (\text{Distance covered during acceleration} + \text{Distance covered during deceleration}) \]
     \[ d_2 = 200 \text{ m} - (12.5 \text{ m} + 12.5 \text{ m}) = 175 \text{ m} \]
   - The time taken to travel this distance at maximum speed:
     \[ t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - The elevator decelerates from its maximum speed to a stop.
   - The time taken to decelerate:
     \[ t_3 = t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
   - The distance covered during deceleration:
     \[ d_3 = d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

Now, let's sum up the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 \text{ s} + 35 \text{ s} + 5 \text{ s} = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time to get from the ground floor to the top floor is **45 seconds**.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **First trip (Ground to 10/F):**
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \)
   - Time calculation is similar to the previous question:
     - Acceleration phase: \( t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Remaining distance: \( 50 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 37.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Time to travel remaining distance at maximum speed: \( t_2 = \frac{37.5 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 7.5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Total time for first trip: \( t_{\text{first}} = t_1 + t_2 = 5 \text{ s} + 7.5 \text{ s} = 12.5 \text{ seconds} \)

2. **Second trip (10/F to 30/F):**
   - Distance: \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \)
   - Time calculation:
     - Acceleration phase: \( t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Remaining distance: \( 100 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 87.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Time to travel remaining distance at maximum speed: \( t_2 = \frac{87.5 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 17.5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Total time for second trip: \( t_{\text{second}} = t_1 + t_2 = 5 \text{ s} + 17.5 \text{ s} = 22.5 \text{ seconds} \)

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time for both trips: \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{first}} + t_{\text{second}} = 12.5 \text{ s} + 22.5 \text{ s} = 35 \text{ seconds} \)

So, the total time for both trips is **35 seconds**.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **First trip (Ground to 40/F):**
   - Distance: \( 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \)
   - Time calculation is similar to the previous question:
     - Acceleration phase: \( t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Remaining distance: \( 200 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 187.5 \text{ meters} \)
     - Time to travel remaining distance at maximum speed: \( t_2 = \frac{187.5 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 37.5 \text{ seconds} \)
     - Total time for first trip: \( t_{\text{first}} = t_1 + t_2 = 5 \text{ s} + 37.5 \text{ s} = 42.5 \text{ seconds} \)

2. **Second trip (Ground to 40/F with a stop at another floor):**
   - Assume the lift stops at the middle floor (20/F):
     - Distance to 20/F: \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \)
     - Time calculation:
       - Acceleration phase: \( t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} \)
       - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
       - Remaining distance: \( 100 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 87.5 \text{ meters
