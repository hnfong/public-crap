Okay, you're right to ask for clarification! That statement is a neat little trick for a *rough* mental conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Here's how it works, with examples:

**The Rule:** For every 12°C increase, the Fahrenheit equivalent will have its digits reversed (approximately).

**Why it Works (Simplified):**

The actual conversion formula is:  °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

The trick exploits the fact that the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is roughly linear over certain ranges.  The 9/5 factor is close enough to 2 that a 12°C change results in a roughly 22°F change. This is where the digit inversion comes into play.

**Examples:**

1.  **0°C:**  Fahrenheit is 32°F.  (No digits to invert yet)

2.  **12°C:** Fahrenheit is 53.6°F.  Close to 53°F. The digits are almost inverted.

3.  **24°C:** Fahrenheit is 75.2°F.  Close to 75°F. The digits are almost inverted.

4.  **36°C:** Fahrenheit is 96.8°F.  Close to 96°F. The digits are almost inverted.

5.  **48°C:** Fahrenheit is 116.4°F. Close to 116°F. The digits are almost inverted.

6.  **-12°C:** Fahrenheit is 10.4°F. Close to 10°F. The digits are almost inverted.

**Important Caveats:**

*   **It's an Approximation:** This is *not* precise. It's a quick mental shortcut. The actual Fahrenheit value will be slightly off.
*   **Works Best Around Common Temperatures:** The trick is most accurate around everyday temperatures (e.g., 0-100°C).  At extreme temperatures, the error becomes more significant.
*   **Not for Critical Calculations:** Don't rely on this for scientific or engineering work. Use the proper formula.

**In essence, it's a fun way to get a ballpark estimate of Fahrenheit when you only know Celsius, and vice versa, without doing the full calculation.**  It's a trick that works surprisingly well for quick, rough conversions.
