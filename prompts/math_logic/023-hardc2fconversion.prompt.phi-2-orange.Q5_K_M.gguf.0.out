"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is incorrect and doesn't provide the correct relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F). The correct formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

F = (C × 9/5) + 32

To understand the relationship better, let's consider a couple of examples:

1. If we convert 0°C to Fahrenheit:
   F = (0 × 9/5) + 32
   F = 32°F

2. If we convert 25°C to Fahrenheit:
   F = (25 × 9/5) + 32
   F = 77°F

In these examples, the digits are not inverted when we convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. The statement you provided is a common misconception that only applies to converting Fahrenheit to Celsius.

To summarize, the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is: every 9/5°C is equal to 1.8°F, and every 5°C is equal to 9/5°F.

I apologize for the confusion with the original statement. Here's the corrected version:

"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 9/5°C, the temperature increases by 1.8°F."

This revised statement accurately conveys the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

I hope this clarifies the misconception and provides the correct information on the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let me know if you have any further questions!
