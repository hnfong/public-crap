Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Sure, I'll help you with each question step by step.

1. **How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

   The lift/elevator moves at a constant speed of 5 meters per second (m/s). The distance from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) is 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. 

   The total distance the lift needs to travel is:
   \[
   40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]

   Since the lift moves at a constant speed of 5 m/s, the time taken to travel this distance is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

   The lift starts at the ground floor (1/F). The first person goes to the 10th floor (10/F), and the second person goes to the 30th floor (30/F).

   The total distance the lift needs to travel is:
   \[
   (10 \text{ floors} - 1 \text{ floor}) + (30 \text{ floors} - 1 \text{ floor}) = 19 \text{ floors} + 29 \text{ floors} = 48 \text{ floors}
   \]

   Since the lift moves at a constant speed of 5 m/s, the time taken to travel this distance is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{48 \text{ floors}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 9.6 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

   The lift starts at the ground floor (1/F). The first person goes to the 40th floor (40/F). The lift needs to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F.

   Let's assume the second person goes to floor 30/F (since it's the closest floor to 40/F without going to the same floor).

   The total distance the lift needs to travel is:
   \[
   (40 \text{ floors} - 1 \text{ floor}) + (30 \text{ floors} - 1 \text{ floor}) = 39 \text{ floors}
   \]

   Since the lift moves at a constant speed of 5 m/s, the time taken to travel this distance is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{39 \text{ floors}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 7.8 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, the answers are:
1. 40 seconds
2. 9.6 seconds
3. 7.8 seconds [end of text]
