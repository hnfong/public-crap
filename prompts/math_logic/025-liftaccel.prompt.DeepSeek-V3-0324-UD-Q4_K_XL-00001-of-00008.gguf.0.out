### **Question 1: Time to go from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

**Given:**
- Number of floors = 40
- Height per floor = 5 m
- Total height = 40 × 5 = 200 m
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s²
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s

**Steps:**
1. **Determine time to reach maximum speed:**
   - Acceleration phase: \( v = u + at \)
   - Initial speed \( u = 0 \), final speed \( v = 5 \) m/s, \( a = 1 \) m/s²
   - Time to reach max speed: \( t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \) s
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \) m

2. **Determine time to decelerate:**
   - Deceleration is symmetric to acceleration.
   - Time to decelerate: \( t_3 = 5 \) s
   - Distance covered during deceleration: \( s = 12.5 \) m

3. **Determine distance at constant speed:**
   - Total distance = 200 m
   - Distance at constant speed = Total distance - (acceleration distance + deceleration distance) = \( 200 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 175 \) m
   - Time at constant speed: \( t_2 = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \) s

4. **Total time:**
   - \( t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \) s

**Answer to Q1:** 45 seconds.

### **Question 2: Time for two stops (1/F → 10/F → 30/F)**

**Given:**
- First stop: 10/F
- Second stop: 30/F
- Height per floor = 5 m
- Distance to 10/F: \( (10 - 1) \times 5 = 45 \) m
- Distance from 10/F to 30/F: \( (30 - 10) \times 5 = 100 \) m
- Total distance to 30/F: \( 45 + 100 = 145 \) m

**Steps for 1/F → 10/F:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Time: \( t_1 = 5 \) s
   - Distance: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) m
2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Time: \( t_3 = 5 \) s
   - Distance: \( s_3 = 12.5 \) m
3. **Distance at constant speed:**
   - \( s_2 = 45 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 20 \) m
   - Time: \( t_2 = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) s
4. **Total time for 1/F → 10/F:**
   - \( t_{\text{first}} = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \) s

**Steps for 10/F → 30/F:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Time: \( t_1 = 5 \) s
   - Distance: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) m
2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Time: \( t_3 = 5 \) s
   - Distance: \( s_3 = 12.5 \) m
3. **Distance at constant speed:**
   - \( s_2 = 100 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 75 \) m
   - Time: \( t_2 = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \) s
4. **Total time for 10/F → 30/F:**
   - \( t_{\text{second}} = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \) s

**Total time:**
- \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{first}} + t_{\text{second}} = 14 + 25 = 39 \) s

**Answer to Q2:** 39 seconds.

### **Question 3: Minimum time to 40/F with one additional stop**

**Objective:** Minimize time to 40/F with one additional stop (not 40/F). The additional stop must be somewhere between 1/F and 40/F.

**Approach:**
To minimize time, the additional stop should be as early as possible (to minimize the distance the elevator has to decelerate and re-accelerate). The earliest possible stop is 2/F.

**Steps:**
1. **1/F → 2/F:**
   - Distance: \( (2 - 1) \times 5 = 5 \) m
   - The elevator cannot reach max speed because the distance is too short:
     - Time to accelerate to \( v \): \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 5}{1}} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16 \) s
     - Speed at 2/F: \( v = a t = 1 \times 3.16 = 3.16 \) m/s (not reaching 5 m/s)
   - Time for 1/F → 2/F: \( t_1 = 3.16 \) s (no deceleration, just stop)

2. **2/F → 40/F:**
   - Distance: \( (40 - 2) \times 5 = 190 \) m
   - Acceleration phase:
     - Time: \( t_1 = 5 \) s (to reach 5 m/s)
     - Distance: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) m
   - Deceleration phase:
     - Time: \( t_3 = 5 \) s
     - Distance: \( s_3 = 12.5 \) m
   - Distance at constant speed:
     - \( s_2 = 190 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 165 \) m
     - Time: \( t_2 = \frac{165}{5} = 33 \) s
   - Total time for 2/F → 40/F: \( t_2 = 5 + 33 + 5 = 43 \) s

3. **Total time:**
   - \( t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = 3.16 + 43 \approx 46.16 \) s

**Alternative Approach:**
If we choose a later stop (e.g., 3/F), the time increases because the elevator can reach max speed between 1/F and 3/F, but the deceleration/re-acceleration adds more time. Thus, the earliest stop (2/F) gives the minimum time.

**Answer to Q3:** Approximately 46.16 seconds (minimum time with one additional stop at 2/F).

---

### **Summary of Answers:**
1. **Time from 1/F to 40/F:** 45 seconds.
2. **Time from 1/F → 10/F → 30/F:** 39 seconds.
3. **Minimum time to 40/F with one additional stop:** ~46.16 seconds (stop at 2/F). [end of text]
