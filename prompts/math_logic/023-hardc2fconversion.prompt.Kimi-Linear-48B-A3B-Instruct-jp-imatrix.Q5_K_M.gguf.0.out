The phrase: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

We need to interpret this. It seems like a mnemonic or a trick for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" suggests that if you take a Celsius temperature, add 12, then invert the digits (i.e., reverse the order of the digits), you get the Fahrenheit temperature. But is that correct? Let's test.

Celsius to Fahrenheit formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

If we take C = 0, F = 32. Digits of 0 are "0". Inverted? "0" reversed is "0". Not 32.

If we take C = 12, F = (12 * 9/5) + 32 = (108/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6. Digits of 12 are "12". Inverted? "21". Not 53.6.

If we take C = 24, F = (24 * 9/5) + 32 = (216/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2. Digits of 24 are "24". Inverted? "42". Not 75.2.

So that doesn't hold.

Maybe it's about the digits of the Celsius temperature being reversed to get the Fahrenheit temperature, but only for certain values? Or maybe it's about the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature being reversed to get the Celsius temperature? Let's test.

Take F = 32, C = 0. Digits of 32 reversed: "23". Not 0.

Take F = 50, C = 10. Digits of 50 reversed: "05" = 5. Not 10.

Take F = 68, C = 20. Digits of 68 reversed: "86". Not 20.

So that doesn't work.
