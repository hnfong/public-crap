Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

To solve this, we need to use all four numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) in the expression and ensure the result is 24. Let's try different combinations of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and parentheses to find a valid expression.

Here's one attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Let's try another approach:

```
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 / (4 - 3) * 3 + 1 = 8 / 1 * 3 + 1 = 8 * 3 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Let's try one more:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * 3 / (4 - 1) = 24 / 3 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * 3 - 4 - 1 = 24 - 4 - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
Attempt: 8 * 3 / (4 - 1) = 24 / 3 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
```

Another attempt:

```
