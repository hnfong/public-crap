This statement is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It means that for every 12°C increase in temperature, the digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are reversed. 

For example:
- 0°C is equal to 32°F (0°C + 12°C = 12°C, and 32°F - 12°F = 20°F, so the digits are inverted)
- 12°C is equal to 53.6°F (12°C + 12°C = 24°C, and 53.6°F - 12°F = 41.6°F, so the digits are inverted)
- 24°C is equal to 75.2°F (24°C + 12°C = 36°C, and 75.2°F - 12°F = 63.2°F, so the digits are inverted)

This pattern continues for every 12°C increase in temperature. [end of text]
