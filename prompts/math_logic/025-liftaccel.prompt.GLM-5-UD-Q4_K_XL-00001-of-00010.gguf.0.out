### Question 1: Time from Ground Floor to Top Floor

**Given:**
- Building has 40 stories.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall.
- Total height = 40 floors × 5 m/floor = 200 meters.
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s².
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s.

**Approach:**
We need to calculate the time taken for the elevator to travel 200 meters with the given acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed.

**Steps:**

1. **Determine if the elevator reaches maximum speed:**
   - First, calculate the distance needed to accelerate to maximum speed and then decelerate back to rest.
   - Time to reach max speed: \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \) seconds.
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \) meters.
   - Similarly, distance covered during deceleration is also 12.5 meters.
   - Total distance for acceleration and deceleration: 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters.
   - Since the total distance is 200 meters, which is greater than 25 meters, the elevator will reach maximum speed.

2. **Calculate time spent at maximum speed:**
   - Distance at max speed = Total distance - acceleration distance - deceleration distance = 200 - 25 = 175 meters.
   - Time at max speed: \( t = \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \) seconds.

3. **Total time:**
   - Time to accelerate: 5 seconds.
   - Time at max speed: 35 seconds.
   - Time to decelerate: 5 seconds.
   - Total time = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

**Answer to Question 1:**
It takes **45 seconds** for the elevator to go from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two People Going to 10/F and 30/F

**Given:**
- Two people start at ground floor (1/F).
- First person goes to 10/F.
- Second person goes to 30/F.
- Elevator stops at 10/F to let the first person off, then continues to 30/F.

**Approach:**
We need to calculate the total time taken for the elevator to go from 1/F to 10/F, stop, then go from 10/F to 30/F.

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate distance to 10/F:**
   - Floors to 10/F: 10 - 1 = 9 floors.
   - Distance = 9 × 5 = 45 meters.

2. **Time to reach 10/F:**
   - Check if elevator reaches max speed:
     - Distance to accelerate and decelerate: 25 meters (as before).
     - Since 45 > 25, it reaches max speed.
   - Distance at max speed: 45 - 25 = 20 meters.
   - Time at max speed: \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) seconds.
   - Total time to 10/F: 5 (accelerate) + 4 (max speed) + 5 (decelerate) = 14 seconds.

3. **Stop at 10/F:**
   - Assume a stop time (not specified, but typically a few seconds). Let's assume 5 seconds for door opening/closing.

4. **Calculate distance from 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Floors: 30 - 10 = 20 floors.
   - Distance = 20 × 5 = 100 meters.

5. **Time from 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Check if elevator reaches max speed:
     - Distance to accelerate and decelerate: 25 meters.
     - Since 100 > 25, it reaches max speed.
   - Distance at max speed: 100 - 25 = 75 meters.
   - Time at max speed: \( \frac{75}{5} = 15 \) seconds.
   - Total time: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds.

6. **Total time:**
   - Time to 10/F: 14 seconds.
   - Stop at 10/F: 5 seconds.
   - Time to 30/F: 25 seconds.
   - Total time = 14 + 5 + 25 = 44 seconds.

**Answer to Question 2:**
It takes **44 seconds** for the elevator to go from the ground floor to 30/F with a stop at 10/F.

### Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with a Stop Between 1/F and 40/F

**Given:**
- Two people start at ground floor (1/F).
- First person goes to 40/F.
- Second person goes to some floor between 1/F and 40/F (not 40/F).
- We need to find the minimum time to reach 40/F with one stop in between.

**Approach:**
To minimize the total time, the stop should be as close to the ground floor as possible (i.e., 2/F). This minimizes the additional time due to stopping.

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate distance to 2/F:**
   - Floors: 2 - 1 = 1 floor.
   - Distance = 1 × 5 = 5 meters.

2. **Time to reach 2/F:**
   - Check if elevator reaches max speed:
     - Distance to accelerate and decelerate: 25 meters.
     - Since 5 < 25, it does not reach max speed.
   - The elevator accelerates and then immediately decelerates.
   - Let \( t \) be the time to accelerate before decelerating.
   - Distance covered: \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + (v t - \frac{1}{2} a t^2) \), but since it doesn't reach max speed, it's simpler to consider symmetric acceleration and deceleration.
   - For distance \( s \), the time \( t \) is such that \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \) for acceleration and same for deceleration, but since total distance is small, we can calculate:
     - Let \( t \) be the time to accelerate to some speed \( v' \), then decelerate.
     - \( v' = a t \).
     - Distance during acceleration: \( \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \).
     - Distance during deceleration: same.
     - Total distance: \( a t^2 = 5 \).
     - \( t^2 = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \), \( t = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \) seconds.
     - Total time to 2/F: \( 2t = 2 \times 2.236 \approx 4.472 \) seconds.

3. **Stop at 2/F:**
   - Assume 5 seconds for door opening/closing.

4. **Calculate distance from 2/F to 40/F:**
   - Floors: 40 - 2 = 38 floors.
   - Distance = 38 × 5 = 190 meters.

5. **Time from 2/F to 40/F:**
   - Check if elevator reaches max speed:
     - Distance to accelerate and decelerate: 25 meters.
     - Since 190 > 25, it reaches max speed.
   - Distance at max speed: 190 - 25 = 165 meters.
   - Time at max speed: \( \frac{165}{5} = 33 \) seconds.
   - Total time: 5 (accelerate) + 33 (max speed) + 5 (decelerate) = 43 seconds.

6. **Total time:**
   - Time to 2/F: ~4.472 seconds.
   - Stop at 2/F: 5 seconds.
   - Time to 40/F: 43 seconds.
   - Total time ≈ 4.472 + 5 + 43 ≈ 52.472 seconds.

However, let's verify if stopping at a higher floor could reduce total time. The additional time due to stopping is the time to decelerate, stop, and accelerate again. The minimal additional time is when the stop is at the earliest possible floor (2/F), as stopping later would require more time to reach the stop floor and then continue.

But let's consider stopping at a floor where the elevator can reach max speed before stopping, to see if that's better.

**Alternative Approach: Stop at a floor where elevator reaches max speed before stopping.**

Suppose the stop is at floor \( n \), where the distance to \( n \) is enough for the elevator to reach max speed.

Distance to floor \( n \): \( d = (n - 1) \times 5 \).

Time to reach floor \( n \):
- Accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
- Distance at max speed: \( d - 25 \).
- Time at max speed: \( \frac{d - 25}{5} \).
- Decelerate: 5 seconds.
- Total time to \( n \): \( 5 + \frac{d - 25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} \).

Stop time: 5 seconds.

Distance from \( n \) to 40/F: \( (40 - n) \times 5 \).

Time from \( n \) to 40/F:
- Similar to above, if distance > 25 meters, time is \( 10 + \frac{(40 - n) \times 5 - 25}{5} \).

Total time:
\( T = 10 + \frac{(n - 1) \times 5 - 25}{5} + 5 + 10 + \frac{(40 - n) \times 5 - 25}{5} \).

Simplify:
\( T = 25 + \frac{5(n - 1) - 25 + 5(40 - n) - 25}{5} \)
\( T = 25 + \frac{5n - 5 - 25 + 200 - 5n - 25}{5} \)
\( T = 25 + \frac{145}{5} \)
\( T = 25 + 29 = 54 \) seconds.

This is worse than stopping at 2/F (~52.472 seconds). Therefore, stopping at the earliest possible floor (2/F) gives the minimal time.

**Answer to Question 3:**
The minimum time to reach 40/F with one stop in between is approximately **52.47 seconds** (stopping at 2/F). [end of text]
