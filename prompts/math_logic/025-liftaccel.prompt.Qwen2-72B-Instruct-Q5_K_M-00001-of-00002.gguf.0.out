Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's solve the questions step by step.

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

First, we need to calculate the total distance from the ground floor to the top floor. Since each floor is 5 meters tall and there are 40 floors, the total distance is 40 * 5 = 200 meters.

The lift has an acceleration of 1 m/s^2 and a maximum speed of 5 m/s. We need to find the time it takes for the lift to reach its maximum speed and the distance it covers during this acceleration phase.

The time it takes to reach the maximum speed is given by the formula:
t = v/a
where v is the maximum speed and a is the acceleration.

t = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2 = 5 s

The distance covered during this acceleration phase is given by the formula:
d = 0.5 * a * t^2

d = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 s)^2 = 12.5 m

Since the lift decelerates at the same rate as it accelerates, the distance covered during the deceleration phase is also 12.5 m.

The remaining distance to be covered at the maximum speed is:
200 m - 12.5 m - 12.5 m = 175 m

The time it takes to cover this distance at the maximum speed is:
t = d / v
t = 175 m / 5 m/s = 35 s

The total time it takes for the lift to reach the top floor is the sum of the time it takes to accelerate, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the maximum speed, and the time it takes to decelerate:
t_total = 5 s + 35 s + 5 s = 45 s

1. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

The distance to the 10th floor is 10 * 5 = 50 m, and the distance to the 30th floor is 30 * 5 = 150 m.

The lift will first accelerate to its maximum speed, then decelerate to stop at the 10th floor. After that, it will accelerate again to its maximum speed, then decelerate to stop at the 30th floor.

The time it takes to reach the 10th floor is the sum of the time it takes to accelerate, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the maximum speed, and the time it takes to decelerate:
t_10 = 5 s + (50 m - 12.5 m) / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 37.5 m / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 7.5 s + 5 s = 17.5 s

The time it takes to reach the 30th floor after stopping at the 10th floor is the sum of the time it takes to accelerate, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the maximum speed, and the time it takes to decelerate:
t_30 = 5 s + (150 m - 50 m - 12.5 m) / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 87.5 m / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 17.5 s + 5 s = 27.5 s

The total time it takes for the lift to reach the 30th floor is the sum of the time it takes to reach the 10th floor and the time it takes to reach the 30th floor after stopping at the 10th floor:
t_total = 17.5 s + 27.5 s = 45 s

1. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To minimize the time it takes for the lift to reach the 40th floor, the second person should go to the floor closest to the 40th floor, which is the 39th floor.

The distance to the 39th floor is 39 * 5 = 195 m.

The lift will first accelerate to its maximum speed, then decelerate to stop at the 39th floor. After that, it will accelerate again to its maximum speed, then decelerate to stop at the 40th floor.

The time it takes to reach the 39th floor is the sum of the time it takes to accelerate, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the maximum speed, and the time it takes to decelerate:
t_39 = 5 s + (195 m - 12.5 m) / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 182.5 m / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 36.5 s + 5 s = 46.5 s

The time it takes to reach the 40th floor after stopping at the 39th floor is the sum of the time it takes to accelerate, the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the maximum speed, and the time it takes to decelerate:
t_40 = 5 s + (200 m - 195 m - 12.5 m) / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 2.5 m / 5 m/s + 5 s = 5 s + 0.5 s + 5 s = 10.5 s

The total time it takes for the lift to reach the 40th floor is the sum of the time it takes to reach the 39th floor and the time it takes to reach the 40th floor after stopping at the 39th floor:
t_total = 46.5 s + 10.5 s = 57 s

So the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor if it has to stop at another floor between the 1st floor and the 40th floor is 57 seconds. [end of text]
