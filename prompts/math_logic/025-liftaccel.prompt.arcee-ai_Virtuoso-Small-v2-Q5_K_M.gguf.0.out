Let's break down each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time to get from ground floor to top floor (40/F)

**Total height to cover:** \( 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \)

**Lift's acceleration and deceleration:** \( 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \)

**Maximum speed:** \( 5 \text{ m/s} \)

The lift will accelerate to its maximum speed, travel at that speed, and then decelerate to a stop.

**Step 1: Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed**

\[ v = u + at \]

\[ 5 \text{ m/s} = 0 + 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times t \]

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration**

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]

\[ s = 0 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 \]

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time to decelerate from maximum speed to stop**

\[ v = u + at \]

\[ 0 = 5 + (-1)t \]

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the distance covered during deceleration**

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]

\[ s = 5 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times (-1) \times 5^2 \]

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the distance covered at maximum speed**

\[ \text{Total distance} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Distance covered during acceleration and deceleration} = 12.5 \text{ meters} + 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Distance covered at maximum speed} = 200 - 25 = 175 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Time at maximum speed} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total time**

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ seconds (acceleration)} + 35 \text{ seconds (at max speed)} + 5 \text{ seconds (deceleration)} = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

**Answer:** It takes 45 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Time for two people to get to 10/F and 30/F

**First person to 10/F:**

\[ \text{Height} = 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration**

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance to cover at maximum speed**

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Time at maximum speed} = \frac{37.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 7.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the time to decelerate**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total time for the first person**

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Second person to 30/F:**

\[ \text{Height} = 30 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 150 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration**

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance to cover at maximum speed**

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 150 - 12.5 = 137.5 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Time at maximum speed} = \frac{137.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 27.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the time to decelerate**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total time for the second person**

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 27.5 + 5 = 37.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Answer:** The lift will take 37.5 seconds to reach 30/F, which is the longer time. Therefore, the lift will take 37.5 seconds to get both people to their respective floors.

### Question 3: Minimum time to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor

**Assume the lift stops at the floor that minimizes the total time.**

**Let's consider the lift stopping at the 20/F floor (midway):**

**Step 1: Calculate the time to 20/F**

\[ \text{Height} = 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration**

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to cover at maximum speed**

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Time at maximum speed} = \frac{87.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 17.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the time to decelerate**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total time to 20/F**

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 7: Calculate the time from 20/F to 40/F**

\[ \text{Height} = 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 8: Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 9: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration**

\[ s = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 10: Calculate the remaining distance to cover at maximum speed**

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \text{ meters} \]

\[ \text{Time at maximum speed} = \frac{87.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 17.5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 11: Calculate the time to decelerate**

\[ t = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 12: Calculate the total time from 20/F to 40/F**

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 \
