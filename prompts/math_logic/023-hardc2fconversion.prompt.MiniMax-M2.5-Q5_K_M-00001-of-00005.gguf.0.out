The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a handy memory trick for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit, but it's not a mathematically precise rule—it's an approximation that works for certain temperatures.

Here's what it means:

The trick works because of the relationship between the two temperature scales:
- **F = C × 9/5 + 32**

When you multiply Celsius by 9/5 (which is 1.8), and then add 32, certain values produce results where the digits appear "inverted" or swapped.

For example:

- **0°C = 32°F** (digits "0" and "2" → "2" and "0")
- **12°C = 53.6°F** (often rounded to 54°F) — the digits "12" become "21" (roughly)
- **24°C = 75.2°F** (roughly 75°F) — "24" becomes "42" (roughly)
- **36°C = 96.8°F** (roughly 97°F) — "36" becomes "63" (roughly)
- **48°C = 118.4°F** (roughly 118°F) — "48" becomes "84" (roughly)

So the pattern is: **Celsius × 2 = roughly the "inverted" Fahrenheit digits** (when you multiply by 2 and then add 32, the result tends to flip the digits).

Actually, a more accurate way to describe it is:
- **F ≈ (C × 2) + 30** (for a quick estimate)

So:
- 10°C → 10 × 2 + 30 = 50°F (actual: 50°F) ✓
- 20°C → 20 × 2 + 30 = 70°F (actual: 68°F) ≈
- 30°C → 30 × 2 + 30 = 90°F (actual: 86°F) ≈

This "inverted digits" trick is a fun mnemonic, but it's only approximate and works best for temperatures in the range where the pattern is noticeable. It's not a substitute for the actual formula when precision is needed.
