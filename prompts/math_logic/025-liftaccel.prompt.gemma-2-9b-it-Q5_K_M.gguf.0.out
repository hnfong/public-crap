Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Here's how to solve these problems:

**1. Ground Floor to Top Floor**

* **Calculate the total height:** 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters
* **Use the equation of motion:** 
   *  v² = u² + 2as 
      * where:
         * v = final velocity (5 m/s)
         * u = initial velocity (0 m/s)
         * a = acceleration (1 m/s²)
         * s = distance (200 m)
   *  5² = 0² + 2 * 1 * 200
   *  25 = 400
   *  This equation doesn't directly solve for time, so we'll use another one:
* **Use the equation:** s = ut + (1/2)at²
   *  200 = 0 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t²
   *  200 = (1/2)t²
   *  400 = t²
   *  t = √400 = 20 seconds

**Therefore, it takes 20 seconds to travel from the ground floor to the top floor.**

**2. Two People, Different Floors**

* **Person 1:** Travels 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters
* **Person 2:** Travels 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters
* **Combined Distance:** 50 meters + 150 meters = 200 meters
* **Time:** We can use the same equation as in question 1:
   *  200 = 0 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t²
   *  200 = (1/2)t²
   *  400 = t²
   *  t = √400 = 20 seconds

**Therefore, it takes 20 seconds for both people to reach their respective floors.**

**3. Two People, One Person to 40/F**

* **The key here is to minimize the time spent accelerating and decelerating.**
* **Optimal Strategy:** The lift should go directly to the 40th floor for the first person. The second person should get off at a floor as close to the 40th floor as possible to minimize the time spent accelerating and decelerating for the first person.
* **Without knowing the second person's desired floor, we can't calculate the exact time.**  

**However, we can say:**

* The minimum time will be slightly longer than 20 seconds (the time for the first person to go to the 40th floor alone) because the lift will need to accelerate and decelerate for the second person.
