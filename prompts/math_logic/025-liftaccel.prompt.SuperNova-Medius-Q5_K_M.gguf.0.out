Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's break down each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time to get from ground floor to top floor (40/F)

**Total height to be covered:**
- 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters

**Lift's motion:**
- Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s^2
- Maximum speed (v_max) = 5 m/s

**Time to reach maximum speed:**
- Using v = u + at, where u = 0 (initial speed), v = 5 m/s, a = 1 m/s^2
- 5 = 0 + 1 * t
- t = 5 seconds

**Distance covered during acceleration:**
- Using s = ut + (1/2)at^2, where u = 0, a = 1 m/s^2, t = 5 seconds
- s = 0 + (1/2) * 1 * 5^2 = 12.5 meters

**Distance covered at maximum speed:**
- Total height = 200 meters
- Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters
- Distance covered during deceleration = 12.5 meters (same as acceleration)
- Distance covered at maximum speed = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters

**Time to cover distance at maximum speed:**
- Time = Distance / Speed = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds

**Time to decelerate:**
- Same as acceleration time = 5 seconds

**Total time:**
- Total time = Time to accelerate + Time at max speed + Time to decelerate
- Total time = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

### Question 2: Time for two people to get to 10/F and 30/F

**First person to 10/F:**
- Height to cover = 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters

**Time to reach maximum speed:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Distance covered during acceleration:**
- s = 12.5 meters

**Distance covered at maximum speed:**
- Distance covered at max speed = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters

**Time to cover distance at maximum speed:**
- Time = 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds

**Time to decelerate:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Total time for first person:**
- Total time = 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds

**Second person to 30/F:**
- Height to cover = 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters

**Time to reach maximum speed:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Distance covered during acceleration:**
- s = 12.5 meters

**Distance covered at maximum speed:**
- Distance covered at max speed = 150 - 12.5 = 137.5 meters

**Time to cover distance at maximum speed:**
- Time = 137.5 / 5 = 27.5 seconds

**Time to decelerate:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Total time for second person:**
- Total time = 5 + 27.5 + 5 = 37.5 seconds

**Total time for both:**
- Since the lift has to stop at 10/F and then continue to 30/F, the total time is the sum of the times for each segment.
- Total time = 17.5 + 5 (time to decelerate and accelerate again) + 27.5 = 50 seconds

### Question 3: Minimum time to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor

**To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the midpoint between 1/F and 40/F.**

**Midpoint floor:**
- Midpoint = (1 + 40) / 2 = 20.5, so the closest floor is 20/F or 21/F.

**Let's choose 20/F as the stop floor:**

**First segment (1/F to 20/F):**
- Height to cover = 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters

**Time to reach maximum speed:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Distance covered during acceleration:**
- s = 12.5 meters

**Distance covered at maximum speed:**
- Distance covered at max speed = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters

**Time to cover distance at maximum speed:**
- Time = 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds

**Time to decelerate:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Total time for first segment:**
- Total time = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds

**Second segment (20/F to 40/F):**
- Height to cover = 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters

**Time to reach maximum speed:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Distance covered during acceleration:**
- s = 12.5 meters

**Distance covered at maximum speed:**
- Distance covered at max speed = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters

**Time to cover distance at maximum speed:**
- Time = 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds

**Time to decelerate:**
- t = 5 seconds

**Total time for second segment:**
- Total time = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds

**Total time for both segments:**
- Total time = 27.5 + 5 (time to decelerate and accelerate again) + 27.5 = 60 seconds

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 60 seconds. [end of text]
