"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

Celsius and Fahrenheit are two different scales used to measure temperature. The Celsius scale is used in most countries around the world, while the Fahrenheit scale is used primarily in the United States and a few other countries.

The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a helpful mnemonic device to remember how to convert temperatures between these two scales. Here's what it means:

To convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and then add 32. This formula can be written as (C x 9/5) + 32.

The mnemonic device suggests that for every 12°C increase in temperature, the Fahrenheit temperature will increase by a number where the digits of the Celsius temperature are "inverted" or flipped.

For example:
- 0°C (freezing point of water) = 32°F
- 12°C = 54°F (flip 12 to get 21, add 32)
- 24°C = 76°F (flip 24 to get 42, add 32)
- 36°C = 98°F (flip 36 to get 63, add 32)

This pattern holds true for each increment of 12°C, making it easier to remember and apply the conversion formula.
