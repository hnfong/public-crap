The statement *"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"* is a mnemonic (memory trick) to help approximate the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. However, it’s not perfectly accurate—it’s a simplified pattern that works for some temperatures but not all.

### **How It Works:**
1. **At 12°C**, the digits are inverted to get **21°F** (but the exact conversion is **53.6°F**, so this is just a rough approximation).
2. **At 24°C**, inverting digits gives **42°F** (exact conversion is **75.2°F**—again, not precise).
3. **At 36°C**, inverting digits gives **63°F** (exact conversion is **96.8°F**).

### **Why It’s Not Perfect:**
- The actual formula is:  
  **°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32**  
  The "invert digits" trick ignores the scaling factor and offset, so it only gives a rough estimate near certain values.

### **Better Mnemonics:**
A more reliable (but still approximate) rule is:  
- **"Double the Celsius, add 30"** (e.g., 10°C ≈ 20 + 30 = 50°F; actual = 50°F).  
- This works better for everyday temperatures (0–30°C).

### **Conclusion:**
The "invert digits at every 12°C" trick is a fun pattern, but it’s not accurate. Use it as a curiosity rather than a real conversion method. For better approximations, try "double and add 30" or memorize key reference points (e.g., 0°C = 32°F, 10°C = 50°F, 20°C = 68°F).
