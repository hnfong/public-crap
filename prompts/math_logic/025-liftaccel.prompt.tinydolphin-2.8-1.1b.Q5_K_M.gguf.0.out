Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To find out how long it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we can use the formula:

time = distance / acceleration

In this case, the distance is 5 meters and the acceleration is 1m/s^2.

time = 5m / 1m/s^2
time = 50 seconds

So, it takes 50 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F.

According to the problem, the first person goes to 10/F and the second person goes to 30/F.

Since the first person goes to 10/F and the second person goes to 30/F, the distance between them is 10/F - 30/F = 30/F.

The acceleration/deceleration of the lift is 1m/s^2.

So, the time it takes for the first person to get from the ground floor to the 10/F floor is 30/2 = 15 seconds.

The time it takes for the second person to get from the ground floor to the 30/F floor is 30/2 = 15 seconds.

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Since the first person goes to 40/F, the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor. Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F is 15 seconds. [end of text]
