The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember certain temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit. However, it's important to note that this is not a precise rule for all temperatures, but rather a helpful pattern that occurs at specific points.

### Explanation:
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion Formula**: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
- **Pattern**: At certain intervals of 12°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

### Examples:
1. **10°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 10 + 32 = 18 + 32 = 50°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (10 and 50).

2. **12°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (12 and 53.6).

3. **16°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 16 + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (16 and 60.8).

4. **20°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 20 + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (20 and 68).

5. **24°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (24 and 75.2).

6. **28°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 28 + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (28 and 82.4).

7. **32°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 32 + 32 = 57.6 + 32 = 89.6°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (32 and 89.6).

8. **36°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8°F \)
   - The digits are not inverted (36 and 96.8).

### Correct Pattern:
The correct pattern where the digits are inverted occurs at specific temperatures:
- **16°C to 61°F**:
  - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 16 + 32 = 60.8°F \) (rounded to 61°F)
  - The digits are inverted (16 and 61).

- **28°C to 82°F**:
  - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 28 + 32 = 82.4°F \) (rounded to 82°F)
  - The digits are inverted (28 and 82).

- **40°C to 104°F**:
  - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 40 + 32 = 104°F \)
  - The digits are not inverted (40 and 104).

### Conclusion:
The statement is a mnemonic that works for specific temperatures where the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the Celsius temperature. It is not a general rule for all temperatures, but it can help remember certain conversions more easily. The specific temperatures where this pattern holds are 16°C (61°F) and 28°C (82°F).
