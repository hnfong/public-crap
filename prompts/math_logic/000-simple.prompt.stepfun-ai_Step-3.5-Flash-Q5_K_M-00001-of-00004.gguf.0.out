Okay, let's go through each question one by one.

Q1: 1+1=?
That's straightforward: 1 + 1 = 2.

Q2: 6*7=?
6 times 7 is 42.

Q3: 83*59=?
Let me calculate: 83 * 59. I can do 83 * 60 = 4980, then subtract 83: 4980 - 83 = 4897. So 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?
This is bigger. Let me compute step by step. 349 * 683.
First, 349 * 600 = 209400.
Then 349 * 80 = 27920.
Then 349 * 3 = 1047.
Add them: 209400 + 27920 = 237320; plus 1047 = 238367. So 238367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
This is a large multiplication. Let me do it carefully.
6043 * 7489.
I can break it down: 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000.
6043 * 400 = 2,417,200.
6043 * 80 = 483,440.
6043 * 9 = 54,387.
Now add: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200.
44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640.
45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027.
So 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15.
Divide by 3: x = 5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% is one-fourth, so 80 / 4 = 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
Total given: two $20 bills = $40, plus a $5 bill = $45 total.
Book costs $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter of square = 4 * side = 4 * 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine herself, plus two brothers, plus one sister = 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1.
Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷ 4 = 3.
Then 3 + 3 = 6, then 6 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
This is ambiguous. Typically, each person gets one slice, so for 5 guests, they need 5 slices. But maybe including Tom? The question says "5 guests have arrived", so probably just for the guests. But sometimes the birthday person also gets a slice. However, the question asks "how many slices of birthday cake do they need?" referring to the guests? It says "they" which might refer to the guests. But to be safe, if there are 5 guests, and assuming each gets one slice, then 5 slices. But if Tom is also there, then 6. The question doesn't specify if Tom is included. Since it says "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived." So total people at the party: Tom + 5 guests = 6 people. But the question asks "how many slices of birthday cake do they need?" "They" could refer to the guests only. But in context, probably all people need slices. However, without more info, I think it's 5 for the guests. But let's see: if it's a birthday party, usually everyone gets a slice including the birthday person. But the question says "5 guests have arrived", so guests are 5, and Tom is the host. So total 6 people. But the question says "do they need?" which might mean the guests. I think it's ambiguous. But in many such problems, they assume each person gets one slice, and since 5 guests arrived, they need 5 slices. But to be precise, if the cake is for everyone, then 6. However, the question doesn't mention Tom eating. I'll go with 5, as it says "guests".

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
20% of 25 is 0.20 * 25 = 5. So sale price = 25 - 5 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
From 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours and 45 minutes? Let's calculate: from 3:45 to 6:45 would be 3 hours, but we need to 6:30, so 2 hours 45 minutes? Actually, from 3:45 to 4:45 is 60 minutes, to 5:45 is 120 minutes, to 6:30 is 45 minutes more? Wait: from 5:45 to 6:30 is 45 minutes. So total from 3:45 to 6:30: 3 hours? No: 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, but we stop at 6:30, so 2 hours 45 minutes? Let's do in minutes: from 3:45 to 6:30.
From 3:45 to 6:45 is 180 minutes, but we need to 6:30, which is 15 minutes less, so 180 - 15 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, from 3:45 to 6:30: hours: 6 - 3 = 3 hours, but since 45 minutes to 30 minutes, we subtract 15 minutes, so 2 hours 45 minutes? 2 hours 45 minutes = 165 minutes. Yes, 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
22 divided by 4 = 5.5, so we need 6 taxis because 5 taxis carry 20 people, and we need 2 more, so one more taxi for the remaining 2.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.

Now for Q12, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think: "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" The word "they" likely refers to the guests. So if 5 guests have arrived, they need 5 slices. But sometimes the birthday person also gets a slice. However, the question doesn't specify that Tom is included. In many simple math problems, they assume each guest gets one slice. So I'll go with 5.

But to be safe, I can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5" because it might be 6 if including Tom. However, the question says "5 guests have arrived", so the guests are 5, and "they" refers to the guests. So I think 5.

Let me list all answers:

Q1: 2
Q2: 42
Q3: 4897
Q4: 238367
Q5: 45256027
Q6: x = 5
Q7: 20
Q8: $30
Q9: 20 units
Q10: 4 children
Q11: 5
Q12: 5 (but unsure)
Q13: $20
Q14: 165 minutes
Q15: 6 taxis
Q16: 87 degrees

For Q12, I'll note the uncertainty.
