Let's solve each question step by step.

### **Given:**
- Building has 40 floors.
- Each floor is **5 meters tall**.
- So, height from **ground floor (1/F)** to **40/F** = (40 − 1) × 5 = **39 × 5 = 195 meters**  
  *(Note: Ground floor is 1/F, so floor 2 is 5 m above ground, ..., floor 40 is 39 intervals above ground.)*

- Lift acceleration/deceleration: **a = 1 m/s²**
- Maximum speed: **v_max = 5 m/s**

We need to analyze the motion profile of the lift.

---

### **Motion Profile Analysis**

For a lift accelerating at **a = 1 m/s²** to a max speed **v_max = 5 m/s**, the time to reach max speed is:

\[
t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5\ \text{s}
\]

Distance covered during acceleration (and same during deceleration, assuming symmetric profile):

\[
d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 25 = 12.5\ \text{m}
\]

So total distance needed for accelerate + decelerate (no cruising at max speed) = 12.5 + 12.5 = **25 m**

If the total distance **D > 25 m**, then the lift reaches max speed and cruises at 5 m/s for some time.

Let’s define:

- If D ≤ 25 m: triangular velocity profile (accelerate then decelerate, no cruise)
- If D > 25 m: trapezoidal profile (accelerate → cruise → decelerate)

We’ll use this for all parts.

## **Question 1: Ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

Distance:  
\[
D = (40 - 1) \times 5 = 195\ \text{m}
\]

Since 195 > 25, the lift reaches max speed.

- Acceleration phase:  
  - time = 5 s  
  - distance = 12.5 m  
- Deceleration phase:  
  - time = 5 s  
  - distance = 12.5 m  
- Remaining distance for cruise:  
  \[
  D_{\text{cruise}} = 195 - 25 = 170\ \text{m}
  \]
- Cruise time:  
  \[
  t_{\text{cruise}} = \frac{170}{5} = 34\ \text{s}
  \]

**Total time** = 5 + 34 + 5 = **44 seconds**

✅ **Answer 1: 44 seconds**

## **Question 2: Two people — one to 10/F, one to 30/F**

Assume the lift stops at 10/F to let first person out, then continues to 30/F for second person.

We need to compute:

- Time from 1/F → 10/F  
- Plus time from 10/F → 30/F  
- Plus **door dwell time?** Not given — assume **zero dwell time** unless specified.

So compute distances:

- 1/F to 10/F: (10 − 1) × 5 = 9 × 5 = **45 m**
- 10/F to 30/F: (30 − 10) × 5 = 20 × 5 = **100 m**

Now analyze each leg.

### Leg 1: 45 m

Compare to 25 m (min distance for accel + decel).  
45 > 25 → trapezoidal.

- Accel: 12.5 m, 5 s  
- Decel: 12.5 m, 5 s  
- Cruise: 45 − 25 = 20 m → time = 20 / 5 = 4 s  
- Total = 5 + 4 + 5 = **14 s**

### Leg 2: 100 m

100 > 25 → trapezoidal.

- Accel + decel = 25 m  
- Cruise = 100 − 25 = 75 m → time = 75 / 5 = 15 s  
- Total = 5 + 15 + 5 = **25 s**

**Total time for both stops** = 14 + 25 = **39 seconds**

✅ **Answer 2: 39 seconds**

*(Note: If dwell time were included, it would be added, but not given.)*

## **Question 3: Person to 40/F (195 m), but lift must stop at **some** floor between 1/F and 40/F (i.e., not ground or top), and second person does NOT go to 40/F. What is the **minimum** time for lift to reach 40/F?**

Interpretation:

- Lift starts at 1/F (ground).
- Must stop at **at least one intermediate floor** (say floor *k*, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 39).
- One person gets off at *k*, the other continues to 40/F.
- We want to **minimize total time to reach 40/F**, i.e., minimize time to go from 1/F → k → 40/F.

We can choose *k* to minimize total time.

Let’s define:

- Distance 1/F → k: $ D_1 = (k - 1) \cdot 5 $
- Distance k → 40/F: $ D_2 = (40 - k) \cdot 5 $
- Total distance = $ D_1 + D_2 = 195 $ m (fixed), but the **motion profile changes** because the lift must stop at floor *k* — i.e., it must decelerate to 0 at *k*, then accelerate again.

So unlike Question 2 (where we assumed lift stops and immediately continues), here we must include full stop: decelerate to rest, dwell (assume zero), then accelerate again.

So the motion is:

- Accelerate → possibly cruise → decelerate to stop at *k*  
- Then accelerate → possibly cruise → decelerate to stop at 40/F

We want to minimize total time over integer $ k \in [2, 39] $.

Let’s derive a general expression.

Let’s define:

- For a segment of distance $ D $, with max speed $ v = 5 $, acceleration $ a = 1 $, the **minimum time to travel D with start and stop at rest** is:

If $ D \le 25 $: triangular profile  
\[
t = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{D}{a}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{D} \quad (\text{since } a = 1)
\]
Because $ D = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 $, and total time = 2 t₁, so $ t = 2 \sqrt{2D/a} $? Wait — let’s double-check.

Actually:

- For symmetric accelerate-decelerate (no cruise), distance:
  \[
  D = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 \right) = a t_1^2 \Rightarrow t_1 = \sqrt{D/a}
  \]
- Total time = $ 2 t_1 = 2 \sqrt{D/a} $

Since $ a = 1 $, $ t = 2 \sqrt{D} $

But earlier we computed for D = 25:  
$ t = 2 \sqrt{25} = 10 $ s — matches (5 s accel + 5 s decel). Good.

If $ D > 25 $: trapezoidal  
- Time to reach max speed: $ t_{\text{acc}} = v/a = 5 $ s  
- Distance during accel: $ d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = 12.5 $  
- So accel + decel = 25 m  
- Cruise distance: $ D - 25 $  
- Cruise time: $ (D - 25)/v $  
- Total time: $ 10 + \frac{D - 25}{5} $

So general time function for start-stop over distance D:

\[
t(D) = 
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{D} & \text{if } D \le 25 \\
10 + \frac{D - 25}{5} & \text{if } D > 25
\end{cases}
\]

Now total time for 1/F → k → 40/F is:

\[
T(k) = t(D_1) + t(D_2)
\]
where $ D_1 = 5(k - 1) $, $ D_2 = 5(40 - k) $

Let’s compute $ T(k) $ for various k.

Note: Since $ D_1 + D_2 = 195 $, and both segments must be ≥ 5 m (since k ≥ 2 ⇒ D₁ ≥ 5, and k ≤ 39 ⇒ D₂ ≥ 5), and 5 m is very small.

Let’s compute $ t(D) $ for small D:

- D = 5 m: $ t = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.472 $ s  
- D = 10 m: $ 2\sqrt{10} \approx 6.325 $ s  
- D = 20 m: $ 2\sqrt{20} \approx 8.944 $ s  
- D = 25 m: 10 s  
- D = 30 m: $ 10 + \frac{5}{5} = 11 $ s  
- D = 50 m: $ 10 + \frac{25}{
