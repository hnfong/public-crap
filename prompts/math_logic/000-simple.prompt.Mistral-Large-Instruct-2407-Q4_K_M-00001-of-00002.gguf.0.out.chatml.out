Q1: 1+1=2

Q2: 6*7=42

Q3: 83*59=4897

Q4: 349*683=238487

Q5: 6043*7489=45243487

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
x = 5

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: I am not sure, but I think the answer is...
You gave the shopkeeper 20 + 20 + 5 = $45 for a $15 book.
So, the change should be 45 - 15 = $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
3 + (12 รท 4) - 1
= 3 + 3 - 1
= 5

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
I am not sure, but I think the answer is...
Assuming each guest gets one slice, they would need 5 slices. However, it's common to have extra slices for seconds or in case more guests arrive.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
Sale price = Original price - (Discount percentage * Original price)
= $25 - (0.20 * $25)
= $25 - $5
= $20

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
From 3:45 PM to 4:45 PM is 60 minutes.
From 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM is another 60 minutes.
From 5:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 45 minutes.
Total minutes = 60 + 60 + 45 = 165 minutes

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
22 people รท 4 people per taxi = 5.5 taxis
Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis to accommodate 22 people.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62)
= 180 - 93
= 87 degrees
