Let's solve each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor

1. **Calculate the distance:**
   - The building has 40 floors, and each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - Total height = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. **Determine the time to reach maximum speed:**
   - Maximum speed = 5 m/s.
   - Acceleration = 1 m/s².
   - Time to reach maximum speed = (Maximum speed) / (Acceleration) = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds.

3. **Calculate the distance covered during acceleration:**
   - Distance = (1/2) * (Acceleration) * (Time)^2 = (1/2) * 1 m/s² * (5 s)^2 = 12.5 meters.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance during acceleration = 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters.

5. **Calculate the time spent at maximum speed:**
   - Time at max speed = (Remaining distance) / (Maximum speed) = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds.

6. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to accelerate + Time at max speed = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds = 42.5 seconds.

### Question 2: Time for two people to get to different floors

1. **Person 1 to 10th floor:**
   - Distance = 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.
   - Time to reach max speed = 5 meters/s² / 2 = 2.5 seconds.
   - Distance at max speed = 50 meters - (1/2) * 1 m/s² * (2.5 s)^2 = 50 - 3.125 = 46.875 meters.
   - Time at max speed = 46.875 meters / 5 m/s = 9.375 seconds.
   - Total time = 2.5 seconds + 9.375 seconds = 11.875 seconds.

2. **Person 2 to 30th floor:**
   - Distance = 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.
   - Time to reach max speed = 5 meters/s² / 2 = 2.5 seconds.
   - Distance at max speed = 150 meters - (1/2) * 1 m/s² * (2.5 s)^2 = 150 - 3.125 = 146.875 meters.
   - Time at max speed = 146.875 meters / 5 m/s = 29.375 seconds.
   - Total time = 2.5 seconds + 29.375 seconds = 31.875 seconds.

3. **Time for both to complete:**
   - The person taking longer will determine the total time.
   - Total time = 31.875 seconds.

### Question 3: Minimum time to get to 40th floor with a stop

1. **Calculate time to 40th floor without stop:**
   - Distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.
   - Time to reach max speed = 5 m/s² / 2 = 2.5 seconds.
   - Distance at max speed = 200 meters - (1/2) * 1 m/s² * (2.5 s)^2 = 200 - 3.125 = 196.875 meters.
   - Time at max speed = 196.875 meters / 5 m/s = 39.375 seconds.
   - Total time = 2.5 seconds + 39.375 seconds = 41.875 seconds.

2. **Consider a stop:**
   - If the lift stops at another floor (1 < floor < 40), it will take additional time to accelerate, stop, and then decelerate to 0 m/s before continuing to 40 floors.
   - Let's assume the stop is at floor 20 (halfway point for simplicity).
   - Time to 20th floor (accelerate, stop, decelerate):
     - Accelerate to 20th floor: (20 floors * 5 m/floor) / 5 m/s² = 10 seconds.
     - Stop at 20th floor: 2 seconds (assuming stopping time is 2 seconds).
     - Decelerate to 0 m/s: 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds.
     - Accelerate from 0 to 20th floor: 10 seconds.
     - Total time to 20th floor = 10 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 27 seconds.
   - Time from 20th to 40th floor (accelerate, decelerate):
     - Accelerate from 20th to 40th floor: (20 floors * 5 m/floor) / 5 m/s² = 20 seconds.
     - Decelerate to 0 m/s: 5 seconds.
     - Total time from 20th to 40th floor = 20 + 5 = 25 seconds.
   - Total time with stop = 27 + 25 = 52 seconds.

3. **Minimum time:**
   - The minimum time to get to 40th floor with a stop at another floor is 52 seconds.

Final Answer: The final answer is 42.5 seconds for Question 2 and 52 seconds for Question 3. I hope it is correct. [end of text]
