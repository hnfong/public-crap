```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3 - 1)) = 8 * (4 - 2) = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 / (1 - (3 / 4))) = 8 / (1 - 0.75) = 8 / 0.25 = 32, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Correct!
