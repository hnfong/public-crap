The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device designed to help people quickly convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Let's break down this concept and provide examples to illustrate how it works.

### Understanding the Conversion Formula
The formula to convert Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) is:
\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

### The Mnemonic Device
The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" suggests that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are reversed. This is not a precise rule but rather a helpful approximation for quick mental calculations.

### Examples
Let's use this mnemonic to approximate the Fahrenheit equivalent of 12°C, 24°C, 36°C, and 48°C.

1. **12°C:**
   - Using the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F \)
   - Using the mnemonic: 12°C is 12, and if we invert the digits, we get 21.6°F (approximately).

2. **24°C:**
   - Using the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F \)
   - Using the mnemonic: 24°C is 24, and if we invert the digits, we get 43.2°F (approximately).

3. **36°C:**
   - Using the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8°F \)
   - Using the mnemonic: 36°C is 36, and if we invert the digits, we get 64.8°F (approximately).

4. **48°C:**
   - Using the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 48 + 32 = 86.4 + 32 = 118.4°F \)
   - Using the mnemonic: 48°C is 48, and if we invert the digits, we get 86.4°F (approximately).

### Limitations
While this mnemonic can be a helpful shortcut for quick mental calculations, it is not exact and should be used with caution. The actual conversion requires the use of the formula for precise results.

### Conclusion
The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a creative way to remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit for certain temperatures. It provides a quick approximation that can be useful in everyday situations where exact precision is not critical. However, for precise conversions, it's always best to use the standard formula.
