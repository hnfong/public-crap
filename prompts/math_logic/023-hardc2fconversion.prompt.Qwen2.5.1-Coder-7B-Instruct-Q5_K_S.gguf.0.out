"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It suggests that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are reversed.

Let's break it down with examples:

1. 0°C to Fahrenheit:
   0°C = 32°F
   The digits are not inverted, but this is the starting point.

2. 12°C to Fahrenheit:
   12°C = 54°F
   The digits are inverted (32 becomes 23).

3. 24°C to Fahrenheit:
   24°C = 77°F
   The digits are inverted (54 becomes 45).

4. 36°C to Fahrenheit:
   36°C = 97°F
   The digits are inverted (77 becomes 77).

5. 48°C to Fahrenheit:
   48°C = 118°F
   The digits are inverted (97 becomes 79).

This pattern holds true for every 12°C increase. However, it's important to note that this is not an exact conversion method. The actual conversion formula is:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

While this mnemonic can be helpful for quick mental calculations, it's not accurate enough for precise conversions. For more accurate results, it's best to use the formula or a conversion chart. [end of text]
