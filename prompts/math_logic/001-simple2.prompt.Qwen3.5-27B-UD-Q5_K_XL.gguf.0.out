Here are the step-by-step answers to your questions:

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is mathematically significant primarily because it is a **highly composite number** and a **factorial**.

**Interesting Properties & Steps to Verify:**

1.  **Factorial Property:**
    *   It is the factorial of 5 ($5!$).
    *   Calculation: $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
    *   Significance: It represents the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct items.

2.  **Highly Composite Number:**
    *   It has more divisors than any positive integer smaller than itself.
    *   Let's list the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
    *   Total count: **16 divisors**.
    *   Significance: This makes it very useful in measurement systems (like time and angles) because it can be divided evenly by many numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.).

3.  **Sum of Consecutive Integers:**
    *   It is the sum of the first 15 positive integers.
    *   Formula: $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. If $n=15$, $\frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120$.

4.  **Geometric Significance:**
    *   It is the number of edges in a **dodecahedron** (a 12-faced polyhedron) and an **icosahedron** (a 20-faced polyhedron).
    *   It is the number of degrees in a straight angle divided by 3 (though 180 is the standard straight angle, 120 is the internal angle of a regular hexagon).

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**
The solutions are **$x = 9$** and **$x = -2$**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1.  **Identify the form:** The equation is a quadratic in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a=1$, $b=-7$, and $c=-18$.

2.  **Method: Factoring:**
    *   We need to find two numbers that multiply to $c$ ($-18$) and add up to $b$ ($-7$).
    *   Let's test factors of -18:
        *   $1$ and $-18$ (Sum: $-17$)
        *   $2$ and $-9$ (Sum: $-7$) $\rightarrow$ **This is the correct pair.**
        *   $3$ and $-6$ (Sum: $-3$)
    *   Rewrite the equation using these factors:
        $(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$

3.  **Solve for $x$:**
    *   Set each factor to zero:
        *   $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$
        *   $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

4.  **Verification (Optional):**
    *   If $x = 9$: $9^2 - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0$. (Correct)
    *   If $x = -2$: $(-2)^2 - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0$. (Correct)

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
The train can make **3** full round trips.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1.  **Calculate the distance of one round trip:**
    *   Distance between cities = $200$ km.
    *   A round trip involves going there and coming back.
    *   Round trip distance = $200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400$ km.

2.  **Calculate the time required for one round trip:**
    *   Formula: $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$
    *   Speed = $60$ km/h.
    *   Time = $\frac{400}{60}$ hours.
    *   Simplify: $\frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$ hours $\approx 6.67$ hours.

3.  **Determine the total time available:**
    *   A full day = $24$ hours.

4.  **Calculate the number of round trips:**
    *   Number of trips = $\frac{\text{Total Time}}{\text{Time per Trip}}$
    *   Number of trips = $\frac{24}{20/3}$
    *   Calculation: $24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6$

5.  **Interpret the result:**
    *   The calculation gives $3.6$ trips.
    *   Since the question asks how many *round trips* it can make, we must count only the **completed** trips. The train cannot complete the 4th trip within the 24-hour window.
    *   Therefore, we take the integer part (floor) of 3.6.

**Final Count:** 3 round trips. [end of text]
