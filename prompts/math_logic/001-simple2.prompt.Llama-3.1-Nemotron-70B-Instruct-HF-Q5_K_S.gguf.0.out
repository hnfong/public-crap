Here are the answers to your questions with steps:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:** While 120 doesn't hold a singular, universally recognized significance like π or e, it has several interesting properties and appearances across various fields:

1. **Geometry and Trigonometry**:
	* 120 degrees is one-third of a full circle (360°), making it a key angle in equilateral triangles and regular hexagons.
	* The internal angles of an equilateral triangle each measure 60 degrees, and when extended, the external angles are 120 degrees each.
2. **Mathematics**:
	* **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer has. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
	* **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
3. **Electrical Engineering**:
	* **AC Power**: In electrical engineering, 120 volts is a standard voltage for household power in many countries, including the United States.
4. **Other Fields**:
	* **Minutes and Seconds**: 120 seconds equal 2 minutes.
	* **Film and Photography**: 120 film is a medium format film for still photography, offering a square format.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Factor the Quadratic Equation (if possible) or Use the Quadratic Formula**
Given equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Attempt to Factor:**
This equation can be factored as: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

**Step 2: Solve for x**
Set each factor equal to zero:
1. x - 9 = 0 → **x = 9**
2. x + 2 = 0 → **x = -2**

**Solutions:** x = 9 or x = -2

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Calculate the Time for One Round Trip**
- Distance between the two cities = 200 km (one way)
- Total distance for a round trip = 200 km * 2 = 400 km
- Speed of the train = 60 km/h
- Time for one round trip = Total distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = **6.67 hours** (approximately)

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Round Trips in a Full Day**
- Hours in a full day = 24 hours
- Number of round trips = Total hours in a day / Time for one round trip
- Number of round trips ≈ 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ **3.6**

**Since you cannot make a fraction of a trip, the train can make approximately 3 full round trips in a 24-hour period.** [end of text]
