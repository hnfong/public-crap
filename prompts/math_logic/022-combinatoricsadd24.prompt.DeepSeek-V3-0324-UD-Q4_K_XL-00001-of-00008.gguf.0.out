Let's try constructing the expression step by step:

```
Attempt: (8 / (1 + 3)) * 4 = (8 / 4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 * 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 + 1 - 3) = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.
```

Final answer:  
**(8 + 4) Ã— (3 - 1) = 24** [end of text]
