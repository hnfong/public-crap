Okay, let's break down the "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. This is a handy trick for *quick, approximate* conversions, not precise ones.

**What it means:**

The rule states that if you have a Celsius temperature that's a multiple of 12, the Fahrenheit equivalent will have the same digits, just reversed.

**Examples:**

* **0°C:**  0°F (Digits are the same: 0)
* **12°C:** 53.6°F (Digits are reversed: 53.6 - close enough for a quick estimate)
* **24°C:** 75.2°F (Digits are reversed: 75.2 - close enough for a quick estimate)
* **36°C:** 96.8°F (Digits are reversed: 96.8 - close enough for a quick estimate)
* **48°C:** 116.4°F (Digits are reversed: 116.4 - close enough for a quick estimate)
* **-12°C:** 10.4°F (Digits are reversed: 10.4 - close enough for a quick estimate)

**Why does this work (a little bit of the math behind it)?**

The actual conversion formula is:

F = (C * 9/5) + 32

Let's look at what happens when C is a multiple of 12:

* If C = 12, then F = (12 * 9/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6.  Notice the digits 5 and 3 are close to the digits 1 and 2.
* If C = 24, then F = (24 * 9/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2. Notice the digits 7 and 5 are close to the digits 2 and 4.

The 9/5 factor and the +32 offset are what cause the digit inversion to be an *approximation*.  It's not perfect, but it's a very fast way to get a rough idea of the Fahrenheit temperature.

**Important Note:**

This trick *only* works well for Celsius temperatures that are multiples of 12.  For other temperatures, you'll need to use the full formula or a more accurate conversion method.  For example, if you try it with 10°C, you'll get a very inaccurate result.
