### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances across different fields such as mathematics, history, and culture. Here are some of them:

1. **Mathematical Properties:**
   - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
   - **Factorial:** 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
   - **Triangular Number:** 120 is the 15th triangular number (the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: 1 + 2 + ... + 15 = 120).
   - **Hexagonal Number:** It is also the 8th hexagonal number.
   - **Sum of Twin Primes:** 120 is the sum of a pair of twin primes (59 + 61 = 120).

2. **Historical and Cultural Significance:**
   - In ancient Mesopotamia, the number 120 was used as a base in the sexagesimal (base-60) number system, which is why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - In the Bible, Moses is said to have lived to the age of 120 (Deuteronomy 34:7).
   - In some contexts, 120 is considered a symbol of completeness or a long lifespan.

3. **Other Fields:**
   - In geometry, 120 degrees is the internal angle of a regular hexagon.
   - In chemistry, the atomic number of the element Unbinilium (hypothetical) is 120.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

The quadratic equation is of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -7 \)
- \( c = -18 \)

The quadratic formula is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant (\( D \)):**
\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]
\[ D = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) \]
\[ D = 49 + 72 \]
\[ D = 121 \]

**Step 2: Find the square root of the discriminant:**
\[ \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

**Step 3: Plug the values into the quadratic formula:**
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

This gives two solutions:
1. \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

**Final Answer:**
The solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Distance between cities (one way) = 200 km
- Average speed of train = 60 km/h
- Time stationed in cities is negligible.
- Full day = 24 hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the time taken for one trip (one way):**
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{one way}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{one way}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.333 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken for a round trip:**
A round trip consists of going to the other city and returning, so:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{round trip}} = 2 \times \text{Time}_{\text{one way}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{round trip}} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{round trip}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.666 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per round trip}} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{72}{20} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can complete 3 full round trips in 24 hours.

**Final Answer:**
The train can make **3 round trips** within a full day. [end of text]
