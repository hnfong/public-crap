<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer three questions, provide steps. Provide answer for each. Provide interesting properties of 120. Solve quadratic. Compute round trips in 24 hours. Provide steps.

Let's compute: distance one way 200 km, speed 60 km/h, time one way = 200/60 = 3.333... hours = 3h20m. Round trip = 2*200 = 400 km, time = 400/60 = 6.666... hours = 6h40m. In 24 hours, number of full round trips = floor(24 / 6.666...) = floor(3.6) = 3 full round trips. Could also compute leftover time: after 3 round trips = 3*6.666... = 20h, leaving 4h. Not enough for another full round trip. So answer: 3 round trips.

Now interesting properties of 120: factorial 5! = 120, highly composite, abundant, triangular number? 120 is triangular number T15 = 15*16/2 = 120. Also tetrahedral number? 120 is also a pentagonal number? Let's check: pentagonal numbers formula n(3n-1)/2 = 120 => solve 3n^2 - n - 240 =0 => discriminant 1+2880=2881, sqrt not integer, so not pentagonal. It's also a sum of first 15 integers, also sum of first 8 triangular numbers? It's also a Harshad number (divisible by sum of digits 1+2+0=3, 120/3=40). It's also a highly composite number (divisible by many numbers). Number of divisors: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 => (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*2*2=16 divisors. It's also a superior highly composite number? Actually 120 is a highly composite number but not superior. It's also a colossally abundant? Not sure. It's also the smallest number that can be expressed as sum of two squares in three different ways? Let's check: 120 = 2^3*3*5. Representations as sum of two squares: 120 = 2^2+... Actually 120 = 2^2+... Let's compute: 120 = 2^2 + sqrt? 120-4=116 not square. 120-9=111 not square. 120-16=104 not square. 120-25=95 not square. 120-36=84 not square. 120-49=71 not square. 120-64=56 not square. 120-81=39 not square. 120-100=20 not square. So maybe not. But 120 is also the order of the symmetric group S5. It's also the number of degrees in a regular dodecagon interior angle? Actually interior angle of regular 12-gon = 150°, not 120. But external angle = 30°, sum of interior angles = (n-2)*180 = 10*180 = 1800°, each interior = 150°. So not.

120 is also the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects (5!). Also the number of seconds in 2 minutes. Also the number of degrees in the interior angle of a regular hexagon? Actually interior angle of regular hexagon = 120°. Yes! So interesting.

Also 120 is a "Stella octangula number"? Not sure.

Also 120 is a "practical number". Also "Egyptian fraction representation of 1 as sum of distinct unit fractions"? Not needed.

We can list many.

Now solve quadratic: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0. Use quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)]/2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2. So x = (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, or x = (7-11)/2 = -4/2 = -2.

Now produce answer with steps.

Let's craft final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Q1 – The number 120 and some of its “cool” properties**

| Property | Why it’s interesting |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Factorial** | \(5! = 1·2·3·4·5 = 120\). It is the smallest factorial that is also a highly‑composite number. |
| **Highly‑composite** | 120 has **16** positive divisors \((2^{3}\,·3·5)\). No smaller integer has that many divisors. |
| **Triangular number** | \(T_{15}= \frac{15·16}{2}=120\). It is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers. |
| **Tetrahedral number** | \( \displaystyle \binom{15}{3}=455\) – not 120, but 120 is the **3‑dimensional analogue of a triangular number**: it equals the sum of the first 8 triangular numbers \(\sum_{k=1}^{8} T_k =120\). |
| **Polygonal** | Interior angle of a regular **hexagon** = \(120^{\circ}\). |
| **Harshad (Niven) number** | Sum of its digits = \(1+2+0=3\); \(120 ÷ 3 = 40\). |
| **Abundant number** | Sum of proper divisors = \(1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 240 > 120\). |
| **Practical number** | Every integer ≤ 120 can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of 120. |
| **Group‑theoretic** | Order of the symmetric group \(S_{5}\) (the permutations of 5 objects). |
| **Time‑related** | 120 seconds = 2 minutes; 120 minutes = 2 hours. |
| **Base‑10 curiosity** | 120 is a **self‑descriptive** number in base‑4: \(120_{10}= 1320_{4}\) (the digits count the number of 0’s, 1’s, 2’s, 3’s). |
| **Egyptian fraction** | \(\displaystyle 1 = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{42}\) – the denominator 120 appears in many classic Egyptian‑fraction decompositions. |

These are just a handful; 120 shows up in geometry, combinatorics, number theory, and everyday life, which is why it is often called a “nice” or “friendly” number.

**Q2 – Solve \(x^{2}-7x-18=0\)**  

1. **Quadratic formula**  
   \[
   x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a},\qquad
   a=1,\;b=-7,\;c=-18
   \]

2. Compute the discriminant  
   \[
   \Delta = b^{2}-4ac = (-7)^{2}-4(1)(-18)=49+72=121
   \]

3. Square‑root the discriminant  
   \[
   \sqrt{\Delta}= \sqrt{121}=11
   \]

4. Plug into the formula  
   \[
   x=\frac{-(-7)\pm 11}{2}= \frac{7\pm 11}{2}
   \]

5. Two solutions  
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   x_{1}&=\frac{7+11}{2}= \frac{18}{2}=9,\\[4pt]
   x_{2}&=\frac{7-11}{2}= \frac{-4}{2}= -2.
   \end{aligned}
   \]

\[
\boxed{x=9\ \text{or}\ x=-2}
\]

**Q3 – How many round trips can the train make in a 24‑hour day?**

1. **One‑way travel time**  
   \[
   \text{Distance}=200\text{ km},\qquad \text{Speed}=60\text{ km/h}
   \]
   \[
   t_{\text{one‑way}}=\frac{200}{60}= \frac{10}{3}\text{ h}=3\text{ h }20\text{ min}
   \]

2. **Round‑trip time** (there and back)  
   \[
   t_{\text{round}} = 2\,t_{\text{one‑way}} = 2\cdot\frac{10}{3}= \frac{20}{3}\text{ h}=6\text{ h }40\text{ min}
   \]

3. **How many full round trips fit into 24 h?**  
   \[
   \frac{24\text{ h}}{t_{\text{round}}}= \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = \frac{24\cdot3}{20}= \frac{72}{20}=3.6
   \]
   Only whole trips count, so take the integer part:

   \[
   \boxed{3\text{ complete round trips}}
   \]

   After three round trips the train has used \(3\times6\text{ h }40\text{ min}=20\text{ h}\).  
   The remaining \(4\) hours are insufficient for another full round trip (which needs \(6\) h 40 min).

---

**Summary**

* 120 is a factorial, triangular, highly‑composite, abundant, Harshad, hexagonal‑angle, group‑order, etc.  
* The quadratic \(x^{2}-7x-18=0\) has solutions \(x=9\) and \(x=-2\).  
* In a 24‑hour day the train can complete **3** full round trips between the two cities. [end of text]
