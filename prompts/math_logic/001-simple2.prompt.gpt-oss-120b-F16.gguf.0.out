<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer three questions. Provide steps. Provide interesting properties of 120. Solve quadratic. Compute round trips: distance 200 km one way, round trip 400 km. Speed 60 km/h, time per round trip = 400/60 = 6.666... hours = 6h40m. In 24h, number of full round trips = floor(24 / 6.666...) = floor(3.6) = 3 full round trips. Could also compute 24h * 60 = 1440 minutes, each round trip 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.666...h = 400 minutes? Wait 6.666h = 6h40m = 400 minutes. 1440/400 = 3.6, so 3 full round trips. Provide answer.

Also maybe mention if partial trip allowed? But question asks "how many round trips can it make within a full day?" So answer 3.

Now produce answer with steps.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Q1 – The number 120**

120 is a “nice’’ integer for many reasons.  Below are some of its most interesting mathematical properties, together with brief explanations.

| Property | Why it’s interesting |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Highly composite** | 120 has **16** positive divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).  Until 180, no smaller integer has as many divisors, so 120 is the smallest *highly composite number*. |
| **Factorial** | \(5! = 1·2·3·4·5 = 120\).  It is the first factorial that is also a *triangular* and a *tetrahedral* number. |
| **Triangular & tetrahedral** | \(\displaystyle T_{15}= \frac{15·16}{2}=120\) (15‑th triangular number).  Also \(\displaystyle \binom{10}{3}=120\) (the 10‑th tetrahedral number). |
| **Sum of consecutive integers** | 120 = 1 + 2 + … + 15 = 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 (seven consecutive numbers). |
| **Abundant number** | The sum of its proper divisors is 240 > 120, so 120 is *abundant*.  In fact 120 is a *super‑abundant* number (its abundancy ratio σ(n)/n is larger than for any smaller n). |
| **Harshad (Niven) number** | 120 ÷ (1 + 2 + 0) = 120 ÷ 3 = 40, an integer, so 120 is divisible by the sum of its digits. |
| **Highly totient** | φ(120) = 32, and 120 is one of the numbers that have the most solutions to φ(x)=n for a given n. |
| **Base‑10 curiosities** | 120 = 5! = 2³·3·5.  Its binary representation is 1111000, which is a block of four 1’s followed by three 0’s. |
| **Geometric** | The regular icosahedron has 120 edges (or 60 edges? actually 30 edges; but the *dodecahedron* has 30 edges; the *icosahedron* has 30 edges; however the *120‑cell* in 4‑D has 120 dodecahedral cells).  In four dimensions the regular 120‑cell (a 4‑D polytope) has **120** dodecahedral cells. |
| **In music** | A “major sixth’’ interval spans 9 semitones; 120 cents = 1 semitone (since 1 semitone = 100 cents).  Thus 120 cents is a slightly “wide’’ minor third. |
| **In chemistry** | The atomic number of **unbinilium** (the hypothetical element 120) is a topic of current research. |
| **In combinatorics** | There are 120 ways to arrange 5 distinct objects (5! permutations).  Also \(\displaystyle \binom{16}{2}=120\) – the number of ways to choose 2 objects from 16. |

These facts make 120 a favorite example in textbooks when illustrating factorials, divisor functions, and combinatorial counts.

**Q2 – Solve \(x^{2}-7x-18=0\)**  

We can solve the quadratic by factoring (if possible) or by the quadratic formula.

1. **Try to factor**  
   Look for two numbers whose product is \(-18\) and whose sum is \(-7\).  
   The pair \(-9\) and \(+2\) works because \((-9)(+2)=-18\) and \((-9)+2=-7\).

   Hence  
   \[
   x^{2}-7x-18=(x-9)(x+2)=0 .
   \]

2. **Set each factor to zero**  
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   x-9=0 \;\Rightarrow\; x=9,\\[4pt]
   x+2=0 \;\Rightarrow\; x=-2 .
   \end{cases}
   \]

So the solutions are **\(x=9\) and \(x=-2\)**.

*(If you prefer the quadratic formula, plug \(a=1,\;b=-7,\;c=-18\):  
\(x=\dfrac{7\pm\sqrt{(-7)^{2}-4(1)(-18)}}{2}= \dfrac{7\pm\sqrt{49+72}}{2}= \dfrac{7\pm\sqrt{121}}{2}= \dfrac{7\pm11}{2}\), giving the same two roots.)*

**Q3 – How many round trips can the train make in a 24‑hour day?**

1. **Distance of one round trip**  
   One way = 200 km → round trip = \(2\times200 = 400\) km.

2. **Time needed for one round trip**  
   Speed = 60 km/h.  
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{400\ \text{km}}{60\ \text{km/h}} = \frac{400}{60}\ \text{h}
   = \frac{20}{3}\ \text{h} \approx 6.666\text{ h}.
   \]
   In minutes: \(\frac{20}{3}\times60 = 400\) minutes = **6 h 40 min**.

3. **How many such intervals fit into 24 h?**  
   \[
   \frac{24\ \text{h}}{6.\overline{6}\ \text{h}} = \frac{24}{20/3}= \frac{24\times3}{20}= \frac{72}{20}=3.6 .
   \]
   Only whole round trips count, so we take the integer part:

   \[
   \boxed{3\text{ full round trips}}
   \]

   After three round trips the train will have used \(3\times6\text{h}40\text{m}=20\text{h}\) and will have 4 h left, which is not enough for another complete 400 km loop.

---

**Summary**

* **120** – a factorial, highly composite, triangular, tetrahedral, abundant, Harshad, etc.  
* **Quadratic** – solutions \(x=9\) and \(x=-2\).  
* **Train** – can complete **3** full round trips in a 24‑hour day. [end of text]
