Let's try different combinations to find the correct expression.

Attempt: (8 / (3 - 1)) * 4 = (8 / 2) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 * 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 - 3) + 1 * 4 = 8 * 1 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 / (3 - 1)) = 7 * (4 / 2) = 7 * 2 = 14, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) / 3 + 1 = 8 * 3 / 3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 1) * (3 - 1) + 4 = 7 * 2 + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 - 1 = 8 * 2 + 4 - 1 = 16 + 4 - 1 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 / (4 - 1)) * (3 + 1) = (8 / 3) * 4, which is not an integer, so it's not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 * 1 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 - 1) + 1 * 4 = 5 * 3 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 + 1 = 8 * 3 - 3 + 1 = 24 - 3 + 1 = 22, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 + 1) - 1 = 5 * 5 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24

Double checking: (8 - 3) * (4 + 1) - 1 = 5 * 5 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 3, 4, 1), which is correct.

The correct expression is: (8 - 3) * (4 + 1) - 1 = 24. [end of text]
