Let's solve each question step by step.

**Given:**
- Building height: 40 floors, each floor is 5 meters tall.
- Total height (H) = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.
- Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s².
- Deceleration (a) = -1 m/s² (since deceleration is negative acceleration).
- Maximum speed (v) = 5 m/s.

**1. Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor:**

To find the total time, we need to consider the time taken to accelerate to maximum speed, the time taken to travel at constant speed, and the time taken to decelerate to a stop.

a. Time to reach maximum speed (t₁):
v = a * t₁ => t₁ = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 s.

b. Distance covered during acceleration (s₁):
s₁ = 0.5 * a * t₁² = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * (5 s)² = 12.5 meters.

c. Distance covered during deceleration (s₃):
Since the lift decelerates at the same rate as it accelerates, the distance covered during deceleration is the same as during acceleration: s₃ = 12.5 meters.

d. Distance covered at constant speed (s₂):
s₂ = Total height - s₁ - s₃ = 200 m - 12.5 m - 12.5 m = 175 meters.

e. Time to travel at constant speed (t₂):
t₂ = s₂ / v = 175 m / 5 m/s = 35 s.

f. Time to decelerate to a stop (t₃):
t₃ = t₁ = 5 s.

g. Total time (T):
T = t₁ + t₂ + t₃ = 5 s + 35 s + 5 s = 45 seconds.

**Answer to question 1:** It takes 45 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**2. Time for two people going to 10/F and 30/F:**

First, let's find the heights:
- 10/F: 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.
- 30/F: 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.

The lift will first go to 10/F, then to 30/F. We need to calculate the time taken for each segment.

a. Time to reach 10/F (T₁):
Since 10/F is below the height where the lift reaches maximum speed (s₁ = 12.5 meters), the lift will not reach maximum speed before stopping.

Using the equation s = 0.5 * a * t²:
50 m = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * t₁² => t₁² = 100 s² => t₁ = 10 s.

b. Time to decelerate and accelerate again at 10/F:
When the lift stops at 10/F, it needs to decelerate and then accelerate again to go to 30/F. The time taken to decelerate to a stop is the same as the time taken to accelerate from rest, which is t₁ = 10 s (since the distance is the same).

c. Time to reach 30/F from 10/F (T₂):
The height difference between 30/F and 10/F is 100 meters (150 m - 50 m).

First, calculate the time to reach maximum speed (t₄):
t₄ = t₁ = 5 s (since the acceleration is the same).

Distance covered during acceleration (s₄):
s₄ = s₁ = 12.5 meters.

Distance covered during deceleration (s₆):
s₆ = s₃ = 12.5 meters.

Distance covered at constant speed (s₅):
s₅ = 100 m - s₄ - s₆ = 100 m - 12.5 m - 12.5 m = 75 meters.

Time to travel at constant speed (t₅):
t₅ = s₅ / v = 75 m / 5 m/s = 15 s.

Time to decelerate to a stop at 30/F (t₆):
t₆ = t₃ = 5 s.

Total time for the second segment (T₂):
T₂ = t₄ + t₅ + t₆ = 5 s + 15 s + 5 s = 25 s.

d. Total time (T):
T = T₁ + T₂ = 10 s + 25 s = 35 seconds.

**Answer to question 2:** It takes 35 seconds for the lift to go from the ground floor to 10/F and then to 30/F.

**3. Minimum time to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor:**

To minimize the time, we should choose the floor closest to the ground floor, which is 2/F (since the lift cannot stop at 1/F, the ground floor).

Height of 2/F: 2 floors * 5 meters/floor = 10 meters.

a. Time to reach 2/F (T₁):
Using the equation s = 0.5 * a * t²:
10 m = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * t₁² => t₁² = 20 s² => t₁ = √20 ≈ 4.47 s.

b. Time to decelerate and accelerate again at 2/F:
The time taken to decelerate to a stop is the same as the time taken to accelerate from rest, which is t₁ ≈ 4.47 s.

c. Time to reach 40/F from 2/F (T₂):
The height difference between 40/F and 2/F is 190 meters (200 m - 10 m).

First, calculate the time to reach maximum speed (t₄):
t₄ = t₁ = 5 s.

Distance covered during acceleration (s₄):
s₄ = s₁ = 12.5 meters.

Distance covered during deceleration (s₆):
s₆ = s₃ = 12.5 meters.

Distance covered at constant speed (s₅):
s₅ = 190 m - s₄ - s₆ = 190 m - 12.5 m - 12.5 m = 165 meters.

Time to travel at constant speed (t₅):
t₅ = s₅ / v = 165 m / 5 m/s = 33 s.

Time to decelerate to a stop at 40/F (t₆):
t₆ = t₃ = 5 s.

Total time for the second segment (T₂):
T₂ = t₄ + t₅ + t₆ = 5 s + 33 s + 5 s = 43 s.

d. Total time (T):
T = T₁ + T₂ ≈ 4.47 s + 43 s ≈ 47.47 seconds.

**Answer to question 3:** The minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor is approximately 47.47 seconds. [end of text]
