Q1: The number 120 is significant in various fields. In mathematics, it's the 5th factorial (5!), meaning it's the product of the first 5 positive integers (1*2*3*4*5). It's also the smallest number with 16 divisors, and it's the sum of the first 15 integers (1+2+3+...+15). In religious contexts, it's often associated with the age Moses lived to (Deuteronomy 34:7) and is also the number of Psalms in the Bible.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, where a=1, b=-7, c=-18. The formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Substituting the values, we get x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2 = [7 ± 11] / 2. This gives us two solutions: x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A full day has 24 hours. A round trip (to and fro) would take 200km * 2 / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours. The number of round trips in a day would be 24 / 6.67 = 3.6, but since you can't make a fraction of a trip, the train can make 3 full round trips between the two cities within a full day. 

I am not sure, but I think the answer for Q3 could also be considered as 4 if the train starts a trip at the beginning of the day and completes it by the end, considering the last trip might not be fully within a 24-hour window. This interpretation depends on the specific context or rules applied to the problem. [end of text]
