Q1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons:

1. Factors: The number 120 has 16 factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more factors than any smaller positive integer.

2. Divisibility: 120 is divisible by all integers from 1 to 10, except for 7. This makes it a useful number for various applications, such as dividing items into equal parts.

3. Factorial: The number 120 is equal to 5!, or the product of all positive integers up to 5. This property is useful in combinatorics and probability.

4. Geometry: In a 5-dimensional space, the 120-cell is a regular convex polytope with 120 vertices, 720 edges, and 1200 faces.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

The two solutions are:
x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions for the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips a train can make between two cities that are 200km apart in a full day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes for a one-way trip:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

2. Calculate the time for a round trip:

Round Trip Time = 2 * One-way Time = 2 * 3.33 hours = 6.66 hours (approximately)

3. Calculate the number of round trips in a 24-hour day:

Number of Round Trips = Total Time Available / Round Trip Time
Number of Round Trips = 24 hours / 6.66 hours ≈ 3.6 round trips

Since a train can't make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips between the two cities within a full day.
