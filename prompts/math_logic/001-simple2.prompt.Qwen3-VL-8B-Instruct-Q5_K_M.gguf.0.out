Sure! Let’s go step by step for each question.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step 1: Basic arithmetic properties**

- 120 is an even number.
- It is divisible by many small integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
- It has 16 positive divisors — more than any smaller number except 60 (which has 12).

**Step 2: Factorial connection**

- 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- This is the first factorial that is also a highly composite number.

**Step 3: Geometric and combinatorial significance**

- 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects (5!).
- In geometry: 120° is a common angle in regular polygons (e.g., regular hexagon has internal angles of 120°).
- In trigonometry: sin(120°) = √3/2, cos(120°) = -1/2 — useful in vector and coordinate geometry.

**Step 4: Number theory**

- 120 is a Harshad number (divisible by the sum of its digits: 1+2+0=3, and 120 ÷ 3 = 40).
- It is a refactorable number (divisible by the count of its divisors: 16 divisors → 120 ÷ 16 = 7.5 → not refactorable? Wait — correction: 120 is NOT refactorable because 120 ÷ 16 ≠ integer. So scratch that.)

Actually, 120 is **not** refactorable. Let’s correct that.

**Step 5: Cultural and historical significance**

- In many cultures, 120 is associated with “a full life” — e.g., “120 years old” is considered very long.
- In the Bible, Moses lived to 120 (Numbers 33:38).
- In some traditions, 120 is the number of days of the “great flood” or “days of mourning” — varies by culture.

**Step 6: Other interesting facts**

- 120 is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors.
- It is the 10th triangular number? No — triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120 — yes! 120 is the 15th triangular number.
- 120 = 10 × 12 — useful in base-10 systems.

✅ **Summary of interesting properties:**

- 120 = 5!
- 120 is the 15th triangular number.
- 120 is divisible by 16 different positive integers.
- 120 is a Harshad number (divisible by sum of digits: 1+2+0=3 → 120 ÷ 3 = 40).
- 120° is a common angle in geometry (regular hexagon, etc.).
- 120 is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 6 (C(6,2) = 15 — no, that’s not 120). Wait — C(6,3) = 20, C(6,4) = 15 — not 120. Actually, 120 = P(6,3) = 6×5×4 = 120 — permutations of 3 from 6.
- 120 is the number of edges in a regular icosahedron (a Platonic solid with 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices — each vertex has 5 edges, so 12×5/2 = 30 edges — no, that’s not 120). Correction: icosahedron has 30 edges. 120 is the number of edges in a 120-cell? That’s 4D — too advanced.

Actually, 120 is the number of edges in a **regular dodecahedron**? No — dodecahedron has 30 edges. Wait — 120 is the number of edges in a **120-cell**? That’s a 4D polytope — yes, it has 120 cells, 720 edges? I’m getting confused.

Let’s stick to the most reliable and commonly known properties:

✅ **Final Answer for Q1:**

The number 120 is significant because:

- It equals 5! (5 factorial), making it a fundamental number in combinatorics.
- It is the 15th triangular number.
- It is divisible by 16 positive integers — more than any smaller number.
- It is a Harshad number (divisible by the sum of its digits: 1+2+0=3).
- It appears in geometry (e.g., 120° angles in regular hexagons).
- It is the number of permutations of 3 items from 6 (P(6,3) = 120).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation**

Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0

Here: a = 1, b = -7, c = -18

**Step 2: Factor the quadratic**

We need two numbers that multiply to c = -18 and add to b = -7.

Let’s list factor pairs of -18:

- (1, -18) → sum = -17
- (-1, 18) → sum = 17
- (2, -9) → sum = -7 ✅
- (-2, 9) → sum = 7
- (3, -6) → sum = -3
- (-3, 6) → sum = 3

So, 2 and -9 work.

**Step 3: Factor the equation**

x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

**Step 4: Solve each factor**

x - 9 = 0 → x = 9

x + 2 = 0 → x = -2

✅ **Answer for Q2: x = 9 or x = -2**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1: Calculate one-way travel time**

Distance = 200 km

Speed = 60 km/h

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 60 = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours

**Step 2: Calculate round trip time**

Round trip = 2 × one-way = 2 × (10/3) = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours

**Step 3: Calculate how many round trips in 24 hours**

Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip = 24 / (20/3)

= 24 × (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

**Step 4: Interpret result**

Since the train cannot complete a fraction of a round trip, we take the **integer part**.

✅ **Answer for Q3: 3 full round trips**

---

✅ **Final Answers:**

**Q1:** 120 is significant because it equals 5!, is the 15th triangular number, divisible by 16 integers, is a Harshad number, and appears in geometry (e.g., 120° angles).

**Q2:** x = 9 or x = -2

**Q3:** 3 round trips
