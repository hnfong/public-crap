Let’s start fresh and see exactly what the sentence is claiming.

Claim  
“The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12 °C, the digits are inverted.”

Step 1 – translate the claim into a testable rule  
- Pick any Celsius temperature C.  
- Add 12 °C to it.  
- The Fahrenheit value that corresponds to C + 12 °C should be the Fahrenheit value that corresponds to C, but with its two digits swapped (the tens digit and the units digit trade places).

Step 2 – check it with real numbers  
Use the exact conversion formula  
F = 9/5 C + 32.

Example 1  
C = 4 °C  
F = 9/5·4 + 32 = 39.2 °F ≈ 39 °F  
Add 12 °C → 16 °C  
F = 9/5·16 + 32 = 60.8 °F ≈ 61 °F  
Digits of 39 are 3 and 9.  Inverting them gives 93, not 61.  The rule fails.

Example 2  
C = 16 °C  
F = 61 °F (as above)  
Add 12 °C → 28 °C  
F = 9/5·28 + 32 = 82.4 °F ≈ 82 °F  
Digits of 61 are 6 and 1.  Inverting them gives 16, not 82.  The rule fails again.

Example 3  
C = 0 °C  
F = 32 °F  
Add 12 °C → 12 °C  
F = 54 °F  
Digits of 32 are 3 and 2.  Inverting gives 23, not 54.  Another failure.

Step 3 – general check  
Let C be any Celsius temperature.  
Fahrenheit at C: F₁ = 1.8 C + 32  
Fahrenheit at C + 12: F₂ = 1.8(C + 12) + 32 = F₁ + 21.6  
So F₂ is always 21.6 °F higher than F₁.  There is no way this fixed increment can always produce the digit-reversal pattern for every starting C.

Conclusion  
The statement is simply false.  No Celsius interval of 12 °C causes the Fahrenheit reading to be the digit-reversed version of the previous Fahrenheit reading. [end of text]
