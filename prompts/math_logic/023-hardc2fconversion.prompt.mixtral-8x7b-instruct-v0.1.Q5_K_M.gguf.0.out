"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
 [/INST] This means that to convert a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit, you can follow this rule of thumb: for every 12 degrees increase in Celsius, the digits of the temperature in Fahrenheit are inverted.

For example, to convert 20°C to Fahrenheit:

1. Divide the Celsius temperature by 12: 20 ÷ 12 = 1.67 (rounded to two decimal places).
2. Multiply this quotient by 100 to get the first two digits of the Fahrenheit temperature: 1.67 × 100 = 167.
3. To get the last two digits, subtract 12 from the Celsius temperature, then multiply by 9 and divide by 5: (20 - 12) × 9 ÷ 5 = 36.
4. Combine the two parts to get the Fahrenheit temperature: 167 + 36 = 203.

So, 20°C is equivalent to 203°F.

This method is not exact and may result in slight errors, but it can be a useful way to estimate conversions quickly and easily. For precise conversions, it's best to use the formula:

F = C × 9/5 + 32

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.
