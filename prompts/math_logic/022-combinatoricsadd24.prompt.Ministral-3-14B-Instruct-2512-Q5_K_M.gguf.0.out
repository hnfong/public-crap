Let's try constructing the expression step-by-step:

```
Attempt: (8 / (4 - (3 / 1))) = (8 / (4 - 3)) = (8 / 1) = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - (4 / (3 - 1))) = (8 - (4 / 2)) = (8 - 2) = 6, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * (4 - (3 / 1))) = (8 * (4 - 3)) = (8 * 1) = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: ((8 * 3) + (4 * 1)) = 24 + 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * (3 + 1)) + 4 = (8 * 4) + 4 = 32 + 4 = 36, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 * 1) = 24 - 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4 + 3 + 1) = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * 4) - (3 * 1) = 32 - 3 = 29, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * (4 - 1)) - 3 = (8 * 3) - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 3) * (4 - 1) = 11 * 3 = 33, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * 3) + (4 / 1) = 24 + 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * (3 - (1 / 4))) = (8 * (3 - 0.25)) = (8 * 2.75) = 22, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (4 * (8 - 3)) + 1 = (4 * 5) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * 3) + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24 (already tried this one).

Attempt: (8 * (4 - (3 / 1))) + something seems redundant, let's try a different approach.

Attempt: (8 / (1 - (3 / 4))) = (8 / (1 - 0.75)) = (8 / 0.25) = 32, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (4 * (8 - (3 + 1))) = (4 * (8 - 4)) = (4 * 4) = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: ((8 * 3) / (4 / 1)) = (24 / 4) = 6, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 * (3 + 1)) / 4 = (8 * 4) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.
```

The correct expression is:

```
(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24
``` [end of text]
