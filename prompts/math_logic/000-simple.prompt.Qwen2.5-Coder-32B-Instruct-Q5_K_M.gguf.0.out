Sure, here are the answers to your questions:

Q1: 1+1=2

Q2: 6*7=42

Q3: 83*59=4897

Q4: 349*683=238,367

Q5: 6043*7489=45,247,807

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   3x = 22 - 7
   3x = 15
   x = 15 / 3
   x = 5

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   You gave the shopkeeper $45 (2 * $20 + $5) for a $15 book.
   The change should be $45 - $15 = $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
   Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   This question is a bit ambiguous as it doesn't specify how many slices each person should have. If we assume each person (including Tom) should have one slice, then they need 6 slices (5 guests + Tom).

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   Discount = 20% of $25 = 0.20 * $25 = $5
   Sale price = Original price - Discount = $25 - $5 = $20

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   From 3:45 PM to 4:45 PM is 60 minutes.
   From 4:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 1 hour and 45 minutes, which is 105 minutes.
   Total minutes left = 60 + 105 = 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis
   Since you can't have half a taxi, you need 6 taxis to accommodate all 22 people.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees [end of text]
