Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties. It is a multiple of 12, 20, 30, and 40, which means it can be divided evenly by these numbers without any remainder. It is also a perfect square, as 120 = 10^2. Additionally, 120 is the smallest number that is divisible by the first 10 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11). 

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation. In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (-(-7) ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)) / (2(1))
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2
x = (18) / 2 or x = (-4) / 2
So, the solutions are x = 9 or x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h and the distance between the two cities is 200 km. To calculate the number of round trips it can make within a full day, we first need to determine how long it takes to make one trip. The time taken for one trip is the distance divided by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the number of round trips it can make is:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / (10/3 hours) = 24 * (3/10) = 7.2 trips.

Since a train cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round down to 7 round trips. [end of text]
