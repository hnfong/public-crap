"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

Sure, I'd be happy to explain that! This phrase is a mnemonic device to help remember the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula is (C × 9/5) + 32, but this mnemonic makes it easier to remember.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with a temperature in Celsius, like 24°C.
2. Every 12°C, the digits "invert" or flip. So, if you add 12°C to 24°C, you get 36°C, and the digits have "flipped" from 24 to 36.
3. Now, to convert 24°C to Fahrenheit, you would normally calculate (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 75.2°F.
4. But using the mnemonic, you can remember that 24°C is "close" to 75°F because the digits have "flipped" when you added 12°C to get to 36°C, which is closer to 75°F.

So, while the mnemonic doesn't give you the exact conversion, it helps you remember the general relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. For example, if someone asks what 24°C is in Fahrenheit, you might remember that it's "around 75°F" because of the digit "flip" at 36°C.

Here are a few more examples:

- 12°C is "around" 54°F (because 24°C is "around" 75°F, and 12°C is 12 degrees less than 24°C)
- 48°C is "around" 118°F (because 36°C is "around" 97°F, and 48°C is 12 degrees more than 36°C)
