### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Factorial of 5**:  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $  
   → So, 120 is the factorial of 5. This is a key mathematical property.

2. **Number of permutations**:  
   120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects (since $ 5! = 120 $).

3. **Divisors**:  
   The divisors of 120 are:  
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120  
   → It has 16 divisors, which is relatively high for a number of its size.

4. **Highly composite number**:  
   120 is a highly composite number — it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. This makes it useful in number theory and practical applications (e.g., time divisions, scheduling).

5. **In geometry**:  
   - 120° is a common angle in geometry (e.g., in equilateral triangles, pentagons, and in the angles of a regular dodecagon).  
   - 120° is also the internal angle of a regular hexagon (each internal angle is 120°).

6. **In time**:  
   - 120 minutes = 2 hours → useful in scheduling.  
   - 120 seconds = 2 minutes.

7. **In biology or chemistry**:  
   - 120 is the number of amino acids in some proteins (though not exact).  
   - In some contexts, 120 is used in medical or biological measurements.

8. **In culture**:  
   - 120 is a common number in calendars (e.g., 12 months × 10 days = 120 days).  
   - In some traditions, 120 is considered a symbolic number for longevity (e.g., "living to 120" is a sign of a long life).

✅ **Conclusion**:  
The number 120 is significant because it is $ 5! $, a highly composite number, and appears in many mathematical, geometric, and cultural contexts.

**Answer**:  
The number 120 is significant because it is the factorial of 5 ($ 5! = 120 $), a highly composite number with 16 divisors, and appears in geometry (e.g., 120° angles), time (2 hours), and cultural symbolism (longevity). It is also the number of permutations of 5 distinct items.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation**:  
   Standard form: $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $  
   Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = -7 $, $ c = -18 $

2. **Use factoring method**:  
   We need two numbers that multiply to $ a \times c = 1 \times (-18) = -18 $, and add to $ b = -7 $.

   Try factor pairs of -18:
   - $ -9 $ and $ 2 $: $ -9 + 2 = -7 $ ✅  
     $ -9 \times 2 = -18 $

3. **Factor the quadratic**:  
   $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0 $

4. **Set each factor to zero**:  
   - $ x - 9 = 0 $ → $ x = 9 $  
   - $ x + 2 = 0 $ → $ x = -2 $

✅ **Answer**:  
The solutions are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Distance between cities**: 200 km  
   → A **round trip** = 200 km (to city) + 200 km (back) = **400 km**

2. **Speed of train**: 60 km/h  
   → Time for one round trip = $ \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} $ hours ≈ 6.67 hours

3. **Total time in a day**: 24 hours

4. **Number of round trips**:  
   $ \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 $

5. **Interpretation**:  
   The train can make **3 full round trips** in 24 hours (since 0.6 of a trip is not a complete trip).  
   → The question asks for "how many round trips can it make", implying complete trips.

✅ **Answer**:  
The train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

### ✅ Final Answers:

**Q1**: The number 120 is significant because it is $ 5! $, a highly composite number with 16 divisors, and appears in geometry (120° angles), time (2 hours), and cultural contexts (longevity).  

**Q2**: The solutions to $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $ are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.  

**Q3**: The train can make **3 round trips** in a full day.
