### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**

The number **120** has several interesting mathematical and cultural properties:

#### **1. Factorial Number:**
- 120 is **5 factorial**, written as:
  $$
  5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
  $$
- This makes it a key number in combinatorics and permutations.

#### **2. Triangular Number:**
- A triangular number is the sum of the first *n* natural numbers.
- 120 is the **15th triangular number**:
  $$
  \frac{15 \times (15 + 1)}{2} = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120
  $$

#### **3. Tetrahedral Number:**
- A tetrahedral number is the sum of the first *n* triangular numbers.
- 120 is the **8th tetrahedral number**.

#### **4. Highly Composite Number:**
- 120 has **more divisors** than any smaller positive integer.
- Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 total)

#### **5. Abundant Number:**
- The sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself.
- Sum of proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = **240**, which is greater than 120.

#### **6. Cultural Significance:**
- In some religious traditions (e.g., Bible), 120 symbolizes completeness or finality.
- Example: Moses lived to be 120 years old (Deuteronomy 34:7).
- In Jewish tradition, 120 is a symbolic number representing a full life.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Answer:**

We will solve this quadratic equation using **factoring**.

#### Step 1: Look for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

- Factors of -18: (1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6)

- The pair **-9 and 2** satisfies:
  $$
  -9 \times 2 = -18 \quad \text{and} \quad -9 + 2 = -7
  $$

#### Step 2: Factor the equation:
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
$$

#### Step 3: Solve for x:
- $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$
- $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

#### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Answer:**

#### Step 1: Understand the question
- A **round trip** means going from City A to City B and back to City A.
- Distance for one round trip = 200 km (A to B) + 200 km (B to A) = **400 km**

#### Step 2: Time taken for one round trip
- Speed = 60 km/h
- Time = Distance / Speed
$$
\text{Time for one round trip} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}
$$

#### Step 3: Total time in a full day
- A full day = 24 hours

#### Step 4: Number of round trips in 24 hours
$$
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train can't make a partial round trip, we take the **whole number part**.

#### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\text{The train can make } \mathbf{3} \text{ full round trips in a day.}
$$

### ✅ Summary of All Answers:

**Q1:**  
- 120 is 5! (factorial), a triangular number, a tetrahedral number, and a highly composite number.  
- It has cultural and religious significance.

**Q2:**  
- The solutions to $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$ are:
  $$
  x = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
  $$

**Q3:**  
- The train can make **3 round trips** in a 24-hour day.
