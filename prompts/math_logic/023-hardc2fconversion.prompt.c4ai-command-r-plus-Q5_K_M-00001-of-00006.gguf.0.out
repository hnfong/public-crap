"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
<|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>This is a mnemonic to help convert temperatures between the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

Here's how it works: 

For temperatures in Celsius, if you divide the temperature by 12, and then look at the resulting quotient and remainder, the digits of the quotient and remainder will be the same digits, in reverse order, as the Fahrenheit temperature. 

For example, let's take a temperature of 36°C: 

- 36°C divided by 12 equals a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0 (36/12 = 3, remainder of 0).
- The Fahrenheit temperature with these digits in reverse order is 90°F (3 and 0 become 30 and 9, respectively, when inverted). 

So, 36°C is equivalent to 90°F. 

Here's another example: 25°C 

- 25°C divided by 12 equals a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1 (25/12 = 2, remainder of 1). 
- The Fahrenheit temperature with these digits in reverse is 72°F (2 and 1 become 27 and 72, respectively, when inverted). 

So, 25°C is equal to 72°F. 

This mnemonic is a quick mental trick to get a close estimate when converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit. For more precise conversions, you can use the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32, or vice versa. 

It is important to note that this mnemonic works best for temperatures above 0°C, as negative numbers will affect the digit inversion.
