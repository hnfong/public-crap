Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. The time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is the same as the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the ground floor. Since the lift goes from the ground floor to the top floor at a constant speed of 5 meters per second, the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is 40 seconds.

2. The time it takes for two people to get on the same lift on the ground floor is the sum of the time it takes for the first person to get on the lift and the time it takes for the second person to get on the lift. Since the first person goes to 10/F and the second person goes to 30/F, the time it takes for the first person to get on the lift is 10 seconds and the time it takes for the second person to get on the lift is 30 seconds. Therefore, the total time it takes for the two people to get on the lift is 10 + 30 = 40 seconds.

3. The time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is the difference between the time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F and the time it takes for the lift to get to the ground floor. Since the lift goes from the ground floor to the top floor at a constant speed of 5 meters per second, the time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F is 40 seconds - 10 seconds = 30 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 30 seconds. [end of text]
