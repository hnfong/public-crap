Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
Attempt: 8 / (1 - 3/4) = 8 / (1/4) = 32, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 * 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 * 3 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
