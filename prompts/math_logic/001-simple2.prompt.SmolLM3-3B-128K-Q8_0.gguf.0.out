Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties. Here are some of them:

1. **Factorization**: 120 can be factored into prime numbers as 2^3 * 3 * 5. This means it has a total of 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120).

2. **Triangular Number**: 120 is a triangular number, which means it can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1. Specifically, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120.

3. **Divisor Function**: The sum of the divisors of 120 is 360. This is calculated by adding all the divisors of 120 together.

4. **Perfect Number**: 120 is not a perfect number, but it is a "multiperfect" number, meaning that the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) is equal to 120 multiplied by a certain integer. In this case, the sum of the proper divisors (excluding 120) is 240, which is 2 times 120.

5. **Hexagonal Number**: 120 is also a hexagonal number, which means it can be represented as the sum of consecutive odd integers starting from 1. Specifically, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 23 = 120.

6. **Factorial**: 120 is equal to 5 factorial (5!), which is the product of all positive integers up to 5 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the total time available for the trip and then divide it by the time taken for one round trip.

First, let's calculate the time taken for one round trip. The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time taken for one round trip is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 10/3 hours (approximately 3.33 hours)

Now, let's calculate the total time available for the trip in a full day. A full day is 24 hours. Since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we can assume that the train can leave and return immediately after the trip. Therefore, the total time available for the trip is 24 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of round trips the train can make within a full day:

Number of Round Trips = Total Time / Time per Round Trip
Number of Round Trips = 24 hours / (10/3 hours)
Number of Round Trips = 24 * (3/10)
Number of Round Trips = 72/10
Number of Round Trips = 7.2

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the train can make 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
