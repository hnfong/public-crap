I'll do my best to answer each question.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting properties:

* 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many divisors. In fact, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
* 120 is a factorial number, specifically 5! (5 factorial), which means it is the product of all positive integers up to 5: 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
* 120 is also a highly abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (excluding 120 itself) is greater than 120. The sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240.
* In geometry, a regular dodecagon (a polygon with 12 sides) has an internal angle of 120 degrees.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x - 9) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x - 9 = 0 --> x = 9
x + 2 = 0 --> x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The distance between the two cities is 200 km.
2. The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h.
3. To find the time it takes to travel one way, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (or approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes)
4. Since the train needs to make a round trip, we need to double the time: 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours (or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes)
5. There are 24 hours in a full day. To find the number of round trips the train can make, we can divide 24 hours by the time it takes to make one round trip: 24 hours / 6.67 hours = approximately 3.6 round trips.

Since we can't have a fraction of a round trip, we'll round down to 3 round trips. Therefore, the train can make approximately 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
