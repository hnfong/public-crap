Assistant: 1+1=2
1+1=2
83*59=4877
349*683=237707
6043*7489=45155287
3x + 7 = 22
Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
Divide both sides by 3: x = 5
25% of 80 = 20
Total cost of the book: $15
Amount paid: $30 (2 * $20 + $5)
Change: $15
Perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units = 4 * 5 = 20 units
Katherine has 1 mother, 1 father, and 3 siblings (herself, her 2 brothers, and her sister), so her mother has 5 children.
3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Each guest needs 1 slice of cake, so 5 guests need 5 slices.
20% off of $25 = $25 - (0.20 * $25) = $25 - $5 = $20
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes, or 2 * 60 + 45 = 120 + 45 = 165 minutes.
22 people / 4 people per taxi = 5.5 taxis
To round up to the nearest whole number, we need 6 taxis.
The third angle in the triangle would be 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
