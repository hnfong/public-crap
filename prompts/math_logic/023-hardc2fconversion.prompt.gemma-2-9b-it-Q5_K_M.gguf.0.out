That's a clever mnemonic to help remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit! 

Here's how it works:

* **The Rule:**  For every 12 degrees Celsius (°C), the Fahrenheit (°F) equivalent will have its digits inverted.

* **Examples:**

    * **0°C:**  0 degrees Celsius is equal to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 and 32 have inverted digits).
    * **12°C:** 12 degrees Celsius is equal to 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 and 54 have inverted digits).
    * **24°C:** 24 degrees Celsius is equal to 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 and 76 have inverted digits).

**Important Note:** This is a simplification. The actual conversion formula is more complex:

°F = (°C * 9/5) + 32

However, this mnemonic can be a helpful starting point for understanding the general relationship between the two scales.
