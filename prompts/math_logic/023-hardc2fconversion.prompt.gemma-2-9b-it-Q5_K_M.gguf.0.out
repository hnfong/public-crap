"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

That's a clever mnemonic! Here's how it works:

**The Rule:**

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" means that when you convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, the tens and units digits of the Fahrenheit temperature will be the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

**Examples:**

* **0°C:**  
    *  0°C * 9/5 + 32 = 32°F
    *  Notice the Fahrenheit temperature (32) has the digits inverted compared to the Celsius temperature (0).

* **12°C:**
    * 12°C * 9/5 + 32 = 53.6°F
    *  The Fahrenheit temperature (53.6) has the digits inverted compared to the Celsius temperature (12).

* **24°C:**
    * 24°C * 9/5 + 32 = 75.2°F
    *  The Fahrenheit temperature (75.2) has the digits inverted compared to the Celsius temperature (24).

**Important Notes:**

* This rule is a simplification and doesn't perfectly reflect the actual conversion formula. 
* The conversion is not always a whole number.
* This rule only works for multiples of 12°C.
