Here are the step-by-step explanations for some of the questions:

Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we can subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15. Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.

Q11: We can follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) to evaluate the expression. First, we perform the multiplication: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then, we add: 3 + 12 = 15. Finally, we subtract: 15 - 1 = 5.

Q14: To find the number of minutes between 3:45 PM and 6:30 PM, we can convert both times to minutes since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 3:45 PM is 155.5 minutes (3 hours * 60 minutes + 45 minutes) and 6:30 PM is 210 minutes (6 hours * 60 minutes + 30 minutes). To find the difference, we subtract: 210 - 155.5 = 54.5 minutes.

Q15: To find the number of taxis needed for a group of 22 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of passengers a taxi can carry: 22 ÷ 4 = 5 with a remainder of 2. Since we can't have a fraction of a taxi, we need 6 taxis to carry the entire group.
