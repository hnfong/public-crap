Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. I need to make sure I understand each question and figure out the steps required. Let me start with the first question.

**Problem 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

Alright, so the building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. That means the total height from ground to 40th floor is 40 * 5 = 200 meters. The elevator has an acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s² and a maximum speed of 5 m/s. I need to calculate the total time taken for the elevator to go from the ground to the top floor.

Hmm, elevators don't just go at max speed the whole time. They accelerate up to their maximum speed, then maybe stay at that speed, and then decelerate to stop. So the time will depend on how much distance is covered during acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.

First, let's figure out how long it takes to accelerate to the maximum speed. The acceleration is 1 m/s², so starting from rest, the time to reach 5 m/s is t = v/a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds. During this acceleration phase, the distance covered is (1/2)*a*t² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, deceleration will take the same amount of time and distance, since deceleration is also 1 m/s². So deceleration phase is another 5 seconds and 12.5 meters.

So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. The remaining distance to cover is 200 - 25 = 175 meters. This remaining distance is covered at the maximum speed of 5 m/s. The time for that is distance/speed = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

Adding all the times together: 5 (acceleration) + 35 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 45 seconds total. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.

Wait a second, maybe I oversimplified. Because maybe the elevator can't reach the maximum speed if the total distance is too short. Let me confirm if the distance required to reach max speed and then decelerate is less than the total distance. Let's see:

The distance needed to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate back to rest is 25 meters, as calculated. Since the total distance is 200 meters, which is much larger than 25, the elevator can indeed reach the maximum speed. Therefore, the calculation above holds. So total time is 45 seconds. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me note that as the answer for question 1.

**Problem 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Okay, now there are two stops: 10th floor and 30th floor. The elevator has to stop at both, so the time will be the time to go from ground to 10/F, then from 10/F to 30/F, then from 30/F to 40/F? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the second person is going to 30/F, so the elevator needs to stop at 10/F and 30/F. But the first person gets off at 10/F, and the second at 30/F. The elevator continues to 40/F? Wait, the question says "how long does it take?" for both people to reach their destinations. Since the second person is going to 30/F, the elevator must stop there, but the first person is already off at 10/F. So the total time would be the time taken to go from ground to 10/F, then from 10/F to 30/F, and then the elevator can continue to 40/F, but since the second person is getting off at 30/F, maybe the elevator stops there and the time is up to 30/F? Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says "how long does it take?" for the two people to get to their respective floors. So the elevator must reach 10/F and 30/F, so the total time is the time taken to go from ground to 30/F, with a stop at 10/F. Because once it stops at 30/F, both have reached their destinations (the first person already got off at 10/F). So the total time is the time to go from ground to 30/F with a stop at 10/F. Alternatively, maybe the elevator has to go all the way to 40/F, but since the second person is going to 30/F, the elevator stops there, so the total time is up to 30/F. Let me confirm the question again: "how long does it take?" for the two people to get from the ground floor to their respective floors. So the elevator must reach both 10/F and 30/F. The time would be the time taken until the elevator reaches 30/F, since that's the last stop needed. So the path is ground to 10/F, then 10/F to 30/F. So I need to compute the time for each segment and add them, considering the elevator's acceleration and deceleration at each stop.

Alternatively, maybe the elevator can optimize the path, but since it has to stop at both floors, the total time is the sum of the time from ground to 10/F, plus the time from 10/F to 30/F. Let me compute each segment.

First segment: Ground (0) to 10/F. The distance is 10 floors * 5m = 50 meters.

Second segment: 10/F to 30/F: 20 floors *5m = 100 meters.

Wait, but each time the elevator stops, it has to decelerate to a stop, then accelerate again. So each stop adds some time. Let me think step by step.

First, going from ground to 10/F:

The elevator starts at rest, accelerates up to max speed, then maybe coasts, then decelerates to stop at 10/F. Wait, but the distance here is 50 meters. Let's see if the elevator can reach max speed in that distance.

First, compute the distance needed to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate. As before, that's 25 meters. Since 50 meters is more than 25, the elevator can reach max speed. So the time would be similar to the first problem but for 50 meters.

Wait, let me recalculate for 50 meters:

Time to accelerate to 5 m/s: 5 seconds, covering 12.5 m.

Then, remaining distance: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 m. Wait, but if it's going to decelerate, then after accelerating, it can go at max speed for some time, then decelerate.

Wait, actually, the total distance is 50 m. Let me think of the motion as acceleration phase, constant speed phase, deceleration phase.

Let me denote:

Let t1 be acceleration time (to reach 5 m/s), t3 deceleration time (to stop), and t2 the time at constant speed.

Total distance: 0.5*a*t1² + v_max*(t2) + 0.5*a*t3² = total distance.

But since acceleration and deceleration are both 1 m/s², and the max speed is 5 m/s, t1 = t3 = 5 seconds each.

So the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 m, as before. The remaining distance is 50 -25 =25 m. Wait, but that would require t2 = 25 /5 =5 seconds. So total time would be 5 +5 +5=15 seconds.

Wait, but 0.5*1*(5)^2 +5*5 +0.5*1*(5)^2 = 12.5 +25 +12.5=50, which matches. So yes, the time to go 50 meters is 15 seconds.

Then, the elevator stops at 10/F. Then, it needs to go from 10/F to 30/F, which is 20 floors, so 100 meters.

Now, when going from 10/F to 30/F, the elevator has to start from rest (since it was stopped at 10/F), accelerate, maybe reach max speed, then decelerate to stop at 30/F.

Again, let's compute the time for 100 meters.

First, acceleration and deceleration phases each take 5 seconds and 12.5 meters. Total for both is 25 meters. The remaining distance is 100 -25 =75 meters. At 5 m/s, that takes 15 seconds. So total time is 5+15+5=25 seconds.

Therefore, total time for both segments is 15 +25 =40 seconds. But wait, do we have to account for the time taken to open and close doors? The problem doesn't mention any door times or stopping times beyond the acceleration/deceleration. So I think we can assume that the stops only involve the deceleration to a stop and then acceleration again, without additional time. So the total time would be 15 +25 =40 seconds.

Wait, but let me check again. The first segment is 15 seconds, then the elevator stops at 10/F. Then, it starts moving again towards 30/F. The time for the second segment is 25 seconds, so total time is 15+25=40 seconds. That seems okay.

But let me think again: when moving from 10/F to 30/F, the elevator has to accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s, then maybe go at constant speed, then decelerate. Since the distance is 100 meters, which is more than 25 meters, so yes, it can reach max speed. So the calculation holds.

Therefore, the total time is 40 seconds. Hmm, but let me see if there's another way. Wait, maybe the elevator can optimize the path by not stopping at 10/F until the last moment? But no, the first person is getting off at 10/F, so the elevator must stop there. So the total time is indeed the sum of the two segments. So 15 +25=40 seconds. So that's the answer for question 2.

Wait, but hold on a second. When the elevator is going from 10/F to 30/F, does it have to decelerate to a stop at 30/F? Yes, because the second person is getting off there. So the calculation is correct. So 40 seconds total.

**Problem 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

Okay, so the elevator has to stop at one other floor between 1 and 40 (excluding 40), and we need to find the minimal time for the elevator to reach 40/F. The first person is going to 40/F, the second to some other floor. The question is, what's the minimal possible time for the elevator to reach 40/F, considering it must stop at another floor. So we need to choose the optimal floor to stop at so that the total time is minimized.

Hmm, so the elevator must make a stop at some floor between 1 and 39, and then go to 40/F. The minimal time would be achieved by choosing the floor that allows the elevator to reach 40/F as quickly as possible, considering the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal time is when the elevator stops at the floor closest to 40/F, like 39/F, so that the elevator can go from 39/F to 40/F quickly. Let me think through.

Let me denote the intermediate floor as N/F, where N is between 1 and 39. The total time will be the time to go from ground to N/F, plus the time to go from N/F to 40/F.

To minimize the total time, we need to choose N such that the sum of these two times is minimized.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me think of the elevator's path. The elevator starts at ground, goes up to N/F, stops there, then goes up to 40/F. The total time is the time from ground to N, plus the time from N to 40.

To minimize this total time, we need to choose N such that the sum is as small as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal time is achieved when the elevator can reach 40/F as quickly as possible, but with the constraint of stopping at one floor. So maybe the optimal point is to stop at a floor where the elevator can still reach 40/F quickly. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the distance from ground to N as D1 = 5*N meters, and the distance from N to 40 is D2 = 5*(40 - N) meters.

The time to go from ground to N is T1, and the time from N to 40 is T2. The total time is T1 + T2.

We need to find N (between 1 and 39) that minimizes T1 + T2.

To compute T1 and T2, we can use the same method as in problem 1, but for each distance D1 and D2.

First, let's note that for any distance D, the time T(D) is calculated as follows:

If D is less than the distance required to accelerate to max speed and decelerate (which is 25 meters), then the elevator can't reach max speed. So the time would be different.

Wait, let's recall the formula for time given a distance D:

The elevator accelerates for t1 seconds, reaches v_max, then maybe coasts for t2 seconds, then decelerates for t3 seconds. Since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, t1 = t3 = v_max / a = 5/1 =5 seconds. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 0.5*a*t1² + 0.5*a*t3² = 12.5 +12.5 =25 meters. The remaining distance is D -25. If D >=25, then the time is t1 + (D -25)/v_max + t3 = 5 + (D-25)/5 +5 = 10 + (D-25)/5.

If D <25, then the elevator can't reach max speed. So the time would be calculated by solving the equation for distance under constant acceleration until it stops. Wait, actually, in that case, the elevator would accelerate for some time t, then decelerate immediately? Wait, no, if the distance is too short, the elevator might not even reach max speed. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the time when D <25 is found by considering that the elevator accelerates for t seconds, then decelerates for t seconds (since acceleration and deceleration are same), such that the total distance is D.

So:

Total distance D = 0.5*a*t² + v(t)*t_dec? Wait, maybe better to set up equations.

Let me denote t as the time spent accelerating, then the same time t spent decelerating (since acceleration and deceleration are same). The maximum speed achieved would be v = a*t. The total distance is the area under the velocity-time graph, which is a triangle: 0.5*v*(2t) = v*t. But v = a*t, so total distance is a*t². Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, if the elevator accelerates for t seconds, reaching speed v = a*t, then immediately decelerates for t seconds to stop, the total time is 2t, and the total distance is the area under the velocity curve, which is a triangle with base 2t and height v = a*t. So area is 0.5*(2t)*(a*t) = a*t².

So if D = a*t², then t = sqrt(D/a). Therefore, the time is 2t = 2*sqrt(D/a).

Alternatively, if D is greater than or equal to 25 meters (since a*t² with t=5 gives 25), then the time is 10 + (D -25)/5 as before.

Therefore, for any distance D:

If D <=25: T(D) = 2*sqrt(D/1) = 2*sqrt(D)

If D >25: T(D) = 10 + (D -25)/5

So now, for each N, compute T1 = T(5*N) and T2 = T(5*(40 - N)), then sum them and find the minimum over N from 1 to 39.

This seems a bit involved, but maybe we can find the optimal N by calculus or by testing.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total time occurs when the elevator stops at a floor such that the time saved by not going all the way to 40 first is offset by the time taken to stop and go again. Hmm, this is a bit vague. Let me try to formalize.

Let me denote N as the floor where the elevator stops. The total time is T1(N) + T2(N), where T1 is the time to go from ground to N, and T2 is the time to go from N to 40.

We need to minimize T1(N) + T2(N).

Let me first compute T1(N) and T2(N) for different N.

First, let's note that T2(N) is the time to go from N to 40, which is the same as the time to go from ground to (40 - N) floors, but in reverse. Since the elevator is going up, the direction doesn't matter, so T2(N) = T(5*(40 - N)).

Therefore, the total time is T(5*N) + T(5*(40 - N)).

We need to find N between 1 and 39 that minimizes this sum.

Let me consider that 5*N and 5*(40 - N) are the distances for each segment. Let me denote x = 5*N, so the other distance is 200 - x. Then the total time is T(x) + T(200 - x). We need to minimize this over x in [5, 195] (since N is from 1 to 39, so x from 5 to 195).

So the problem reduces to finding x in [5, 195] such that T(x) + T(200 - x) is minimized.

Let me analyze T(x) + T(200 - x).

First, let's note that T(x) is defined piecewise:

If x <=25: T(x) = 2*sqrt(x)

If x >25: T(x) = 10 + (x -25)/5

Similarly for T(200 -x).

So depending on the value of x, we can have different cases.

Let me consider different ranges for x:

Case 1: x <=25 and 200 -x <=25. But 200 -x <=25 implies x >=175. But x <=25 and x >=175 is impossible. So this case doesn't exist.

Case 2: x <=25 and 200 -x >25. So x <=25 and x <175. Since x is up to 25, this is valid. So T(x)=2*sqrt(x), T(200 -x)=10 + (200 -x -25)/5 =10 + (175 -x)/5.

Thus total time is 2*sqrt(x) +10 + (175 -x)/5.

Case 3: x >25 and 200 -x >25. So x >25 and x <175. Then both T(x) and T(200 -x) are in the second part.

Thus T(x)=10 + (x -25)/5, T(200 -x)=10 + (200 -x -25)/5 =10 + (175 -x)/5.

Total time is 10 + (x -25)/5 +10 + (175 -x)/5 =20 + [ (x -25) + (175 -x) ] /5 =20 + (150)/5 =20 +30=50.

Wait, that's interesting. For all x between 25 and 175, the total time is 50 seconds. Because the terms with x cancel out. So in this case, the total time is constant at 50 seconds.

Case 4: x >25 and 200 -x <=25. So x >25 and x >=175. So x is between 175 and 200. Then T(x)=10 + (x -25)/5, and T(200 -x)=2*sqrt(200 -x).

Thus total time is 10 + (x -25)/5 + 2*sqrt(200 -x).

So now, to find the minimal total time, we can analyze each case.

First, in Case 2 (x from 5 to25):

Total time is 2*sqrt(x) +10 + (175 -x)/5.

Let me compute this function for x in [5,25].

Let me denote f(x) = 2√x +10 + (175 -x)/5.

We can take derivative to find minimum.

But since this is a math problem, maybe we can compute it numerically or find the minimum.

Alternatively, let's see if the minimal value in this interval is less than 50.

At x=25:

f(25)=2*5 +10 + (175 -25)/5 =10 +10 + (150)/5=20 +30=50, which matches the Case 3 result.

At x=5:

f(5)=2*sqrt(5) +10 + (175 -5)/5 ≈2*2.236 +10 +170/5≈4.472 +10 +34≈48.472 seconds.

Hmm, so at x=5 (N=1), the total time is approximately 48.47 seconds, which is less than 50. So the minimal in this interval is lower.

Wait, so maybe the minimal occurs somewhere between x=5 and x=25?

Wait, let's compute the derivative of f(x):

f(x)=2√x +10 + (175 -x)/5

df/dx = (2*(1/(2√x))) ) + 0 + (-1/5)

= (1/√x) - 1/5

Set derivative to zero:

1/√x -1/5 =0 →1/√x =1/5 →√x=5 →x=25.

So the critical point is at x=25, which is the endpoint of this interval. Since the derivative is positive when x <25 (since 1/√x >1/5 when x <25), so the function is increasing on [5,25]. Therefore, the minimal value in this interval is at x=5, which is ~48.47 seconds.

In Case 3, the total time is always 50, so higher than 48.47.

In Case 4, x between 175 and 200 (so N between 35 and 40, but N must be <=39, so up to N=39, x=195):

Let me compute f(x)=10 + (x -25)/5 +2*sqrt(200 -x).

Let me compute at x=175 (N=35):

f(175)=10 + (175-25)/5 +2*sqrt(25)=10 +150/5 +2*5=10+30+10=50, which matches.

At x=195 (N=39):

f(195)=10 + (195-25)/5 +2*sqrt(5)=10 +170/5 +2*2.236≈10+34 +4.472≈48.472, same as at x=5.

Wait, that's interesting. So at x=195 (N=39), the total time is also ~48.47 seconds.

Now, let's check the derivative in Case 4:

f(x)=10 + (x -25)/5 +2*sqrt(200 -x)

df/dx = (1/5) + 2*( -1/(2*sqrt(200 -x)) )

= 1/5 - (1)/sqrt(200 -x)

Set derivative to zero:

1/5 =1/sqrt(200 -x)

sqrt(200 -x)=5 →200 -x=25 →x=175.

So the critical point is at x=175, which is the start of this interval. The derivative at x>175:

sqrt(200 -x) <5, so 1/sqrt(...) >1/5, so df/dx =1/5 - (something bigger than 1/5) → negative. So the function is decreasing from x=175 to x=200. Therefore, the minimal in this interval is at x=200, but x can't be 200 (since N=40 is excluded). The closest is x=195 (N=39), which gives ~48.47.

Therefore, the minimal total time is approximately 48.47 seconds, achieved at both ends of the intervals (x=5 and x=195). Since the problem asks for the minimal time, this would be the answer. However, since we need an exact value, let's compute it precisely.

At x=5 (N=1):

Total time =2*sqrt(5) +10 + (175 -5)/5

sqrt(5) is irrational, but let's compute exactly:

2*sqrt(5) +10 + (170)/5 =2√5 +10 +34 =44 +2√5.

Similarly, at x=195 (N=39):

Total time =10 + (195-25)/5 +2*sqrt(200 -195)=10 +170/5 +2*sqrt(5)=10+34 +2√5=44 +2√5.

So both give the same value: 44 +2√5 seconds. Let me compute that numerically:

√5 ≈2.236, so 2√5≈4.472. Thus total time≈44 +4.472≈48.472 seconds.

But the problem might expect an exact form or perhaps a rounded number? Wait, but maybe there's a better way to get an exact minimal time?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal time is indeed 44 +2√5, but let me see if there's a floor N where the total time is even less.

Wait, but according to the analysis, the minimal occurs at the endpoints (N=1 or N=39), giving the same time. So that's the minimal possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a floor in between where the total time is less? Let me check with N=2 (x=10):

Total time would be:

T(10)=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324, T(190)=10 + (190-25)/5=10 +165/5=10+33=43. So total time≈6.324+43≈49.324, which is worse than 48.47.

Similarly, N=39 (x=195):

Total time≈48.47, which is better.

Wait, but let me check N=35 (x=175):

Total time is 50, which is worse.

Alternatively, N=38 (x=190):

Total time would be T(190)=10 + (190-25)/5=10+165/5=43, and T(10)=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324, so total≈49.324 again.

Hmm, so indeed the minimal is at the endpoints. Therefore, the minimal time is 44 +2√5 seconds. But the problem might want an exact answer in terms of radicals, or perhaps they expect an approximate decimal? Let me see the problem statement again.

The problem says "Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard)."

Since it's a math problem, perhaps the answer should be in exact terms. Let me see:

44 +2√5 is exact. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where the minimal time is 45 seconds? Wait, but in the first problem, going straight to 40/F takes 45 seconds. Here, by stopping at N=1 or N=39, the time is ~48.47, which is longer than 45. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, this is a problem.

Wait a second, this is conflicting with the first problem. If going straight takes 45 seconds, but stopping at an intermediate floor takes longer, then the minimal time would actually be 45 seconds, but the problem says "it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the elevator cannot go straight; it must stop at least once. Therefore, the minimal time is the minimal possible over all possible stops, which we found to be approximately 48.47 seconds. But that's longer than 45. So the answer is that minimal time is 44 +2√5 seconds, which is approximately 48.47 seconds.

Wait, but let me confirm once again. Let me recalculate for N=1 (ground to 1/F then to 40/F):

First segment: ground to 1/F (5 meters):

Since 5 meters is less than 25 meters, the time is 2*sqrt(5) ≈4.472 seconds.

Second segment: from 1/F to 40/F (195 meters):

Since 195>25, time is 10 + (195-25)/5 =10 +170/5=10+34=44 seconds.

Total time: ~4.472 +44≈48.472 seconds.

Alternatively, if the elevator stops at 39/F (195 meters from ground):

First segment: ground to 39/F (195 meters):

Time is 10 + (195-25)/5 =44 seconds.

Second segment: 39/F to 40/F (5 meters):

Time is 2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 seconds.

Total time same: ~48.472.

Therefore, the minimal time is indeed approximately 48.47 seconds, which is 44 +2√5 exactly. Since the problem might prefer an exact answer, I should present that.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the elevator has to stop at the intermediate floor and then go to 40/F. Wait, but the problem says "it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the elevator must stop at least once before reaching 40/F. Therefore, the minimal time is indeed the minimal over all possible stops, which is 44 +2√5 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better floor to stop at where the total time is less? Let me check with N= something else.

Suppose N=25 (so x=125 meters):

Then T1=10 + (125-25)/5=10+20=30 seconds.

T2= T(75)= since 75>25, T2=10 + (75-25)/5=10+10=20 seconds.

Total time=30+20=50 seconds, which is worse.

Alternatively, N=20 (x=100):

T1=10 + (100-25)/5=10+15=25.

T2= T(100)= same as T1, so 25+25=50.

Same as before.

Alternatively, N=5 (x=25):

Wait, N=5 would be x=25 meters (5 floors). Wait, N=5 is 5 floors, so x=25 meters. Wait, but in the first case, when N=1, x=5 meters. Wait, if N=5, then:

T1= T(25)= exactly at the threshold. Since 25 is the boundary, so T(25)=10 + (25-25)/5=10 seconds? Wait no, wait:

Wait, when D=25, which is exactly the distance where the elevator can reach max speed and then decelerate. So T(25)=10 seconds (5 seconds acceleration, 5 seconds deceleration, no constant speed). So T1=10 seconds.

Then T2= T(175)=10 + (175-25)/5=10+150/5=10+30=40.

Total time=10+40=50, which is again worse than 48.47.

Therefore, the minimal is indeed at the endpoints. So the answer is 44 +2√5 seconds. To write this as a single expression, it's 44 + 2√5, which is approximately 48.47 seconds. Since the problem might want an exact answer, I should present it in the radical form. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where the minimal time is lower?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T(x) when x is less than 25. Let me recheck that.

For x=5 meters (N=1):

The elevator goes from ground to 1/F (5m). Since 5m <25m, it can't reach max speed. So the time is 2*sqrt(x/a). Wait, let me rederive that.

Wait, earlier I considered that when D <=25, the time is 2*sqrt(D). Wait, let me confirm that formula.

If the elevator accelerates for t seconds, reaches v = a*t, then immediately decelerates for t seconds to stop. The total distance is
