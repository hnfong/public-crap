I'll tackle each question step by step. Please note that for these calculations, we'll assume the lift starts from rest and comes to a complete stop at each floor it needs to stop at, accelerating and decelerating at 1 m/s², with a maximum speed of 5 m/s.

### Question 1: Time to go from Ground Floor to Top Floor (40/F)

1. **Calculate Total Distance**:
   - Each floor is 5 meters.
   - From Ground (1/F) to 40/F means moving up 39 floors.
   - Total Distance = 39 floors * 5 meters/floor = 195 meters

2. **Calculate Time to Reach Maximum Speed (if reached)**:
   - Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Maximum Speed (v) = 5 m/s
   - Time to reach max speed = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds

3. **Distance Covered While Accelerating**:
   - Distance = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters

4. **Distance Covered at Maximum Speed (if any)**:
   - Since the total distance is 195 meters and 12.5 meters are covered during acceleration, we check if there's a need for deceleration before reaching the top.
   - Distance remaining after acceleration = 195 - 12.5 = 182.5 meters
   - Since the lift can travel at 5 m/s, time at max speed = 182.5 / 5 = 36.5 seconds
   - **Total Distance Covered by Acceleration + Constant Speed** = 12.5 + (5 * 36.5) = 12.5 + 182.5 = 195 meters (Exactly the distance needed, **no deceleration phase is needed in this ideal calculation** because it perfectly uses up all distance in acceleration and constant speed phases without needing to decelerate, assuming the math works out perfectly for simplicity)

5. **Calculate Total Time**:
   - Time Accelerating = 5 seconds
   - Time at Max Speed = 36.5 seconds
   - **Total Time** = 5 + 36.5 = **41.5 seconds**

**Answer to Question 1:** 41.5 seconds

### Question 2: Time for Two People (10/F and 30/F)

Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step for each stop, let's break it down:

1. **Ground to 10/F (9 floors, 45 meters)**:
   - **Acceleration Phase**:
     - Time to reach 5 m/s = 5 seconds (as in Question 1)
     - Distance covered in 5 seconds = 12.5 meters (leaves 32.5 meters)
     - Time at max speed for remaining distance = 32.5 / 5 = 6.5 seconds
     - **Total Time to 10/F** = 5 (accel) + 6.5 (cruise) = 11.5 seconds
   - **Deceleration Phase to Stop at 10/F**:
     - Assuming it needs to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 over the remaining distance not covered by cruise (which in this calculation isn't needed as we've used all distance for acceleration and cruise, but for realism):
     - Since we've perfectly used distance, let's assume a brief deceleration phase of **2.5 seconds** for simplicity (actual calculation would require solving for the exact distance needed to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0, which would be \(v^2 / (2a) = 5^2 / (2*1) = 12.5 meters\), which we've already accounted for in acceleration, indicating an oversight in the initial simplification. For a more accurate approach without assuming perfect distance usage:
       - **Correct Approach for Deceleration to 10/F**:
         - Distance to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 = \(12.5 meters\) (as calculated)
         - Since we've traveled 12.5 meters during acceleration and would travel the rest at constant speed, the error was in assuming no deceleration distance needed after cruise. Given the 45 meters total:
           - **Acceleration**: 12.5 meters, **Cruise**: 32.5 meters (as before)
           - **Deceleration for Last 0 meters (since 12.5+32.5=45)**: Actually, we see the lift would still be at 5 m/s after 45 meters of travel (12.5 acc + 32.5 cruise), meaning it **would need to decelerate**:
             - **Time to Decelerate**: Since distance to decelerate (to stop) from 5 m/s is 12.5 meters, and we've used all 45 meters in acc and cruise, the lift would need an additional deceleration phase after the 45 meters are traveled at the speeds calculated:
               - **Correct Total Time to 10/F**:
                 - **Acceleration**: 5 seconds
                 - **Cruise**: 6.5 seconds
                 - **Deceleration**: Time to decelerate from 5 m/s over 12.5 meters = \(t = \sqrt{(2 \times 12.5)/1} = \sqrt{25} = 5 seconds\)
                 - **Total to 10/F**: 5 + 6.5 + 5 = **16.5 seconds**

2. **10/F to 30/F (20 floors, 100 meters, already at 0 m/s)**:
   - **Acceleration Phase**:
     - Time to reach 5 m/s = 5 seconds
     - Distance covered = 12.5 meters, leaving 87.5 meters
     - Time at max speed = 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds
   - **Deceleration Phase to 30/F**:
     - Similar to above, needs to decelerate from 5 m/s over 12.5 meters:
     - **Time to Decelerate**: 5 seconds (as calculated before)
     - **Total Time from 10/F to 30/F**: 5 (acc) + 17.5 (cruise) + 5 (dec) = **27.5 seconds**
   - **Total Time for Second Person (Ground to 30/F)**: 16.5 (to 10/F) + 27.5 (10/F to 30/F) = **44 seconds**

**However, since the lift stops at 10/F and then proceeds, the correct approach for the total time for both to reach their destinations (considering the lift doesn't wait but continues after the first stop)**:

- **First Person's Time to 10/F**: 16.5 seconds
- **Lift then proceeds to 30/F**:
  - **Additional Time after 10/F for the Lift to Reach 30/F**: 27.5 seconds
  - **Total Time for Second Person (Ground to 30/F)**: 16.5 + 27.5 = **44 seconds**

**Answer to Question 2:** 
- **First Person to 10/F**: 16.5 seconds
- **Second Person to 30/F**: 44 seconds
- **Total Time for Both (considering sequential stops)**: 44 seconds (as the second person's time encompasses both stops)

### Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with a Mandatory Stop

To minimize time to 40/F with a stop, the lift should stop as close as possible to 40/F to minimize the deceleration distance after the stop (since deceleration distance is fixed at 12.5 meters from 5 m/s to 0).

1. **Optimal Stop Floor**:
   - Stop at 39/F (1 floor below 40/F), so the lift only needs to travel 5 meters from the stop to 40/F, which is less than the deceleration distance required from 5 m/s, implying it must decelerate before reaching 39/F to then accelerate to 40/F isn't optimal. 
   - **Correct Approach**: Stop at a floor where the lift can decelerate to 0 and then accelerate to 40/F with the least additional time. Given the deceleration distance is 12.5 meters, stopping at **38/F** allows for:
