The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic or shortcut to help quickly estimate the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit for certain temperatures. Here's what it means and how it works with examples:

### Explanation:
The phrase suggests that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit are "inverted" (i.e., reversed). This works for specific temperatures where the Celsius and Fahrenheit values are reverses of each other.

### How It Works:
1. **Identify the Celsius temperature**: Look for a Celsius temperature where the digits, when reversed, give a Fahrenheit temperature.
2. **Check the Fahrenheit equivalent**: Verify that the Fahrenheit temperature is indeed the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

### Examples:
1. **24°C → 75°F**:
   - Celsius: 24
   - Reverse the digits: 42
   - However, 24°C is actually 75.2°F (using the exact formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)).
   - The digits of 75 are not the reverse of 24, so this doesn't fit. This suggests the mnemonic might not be perfect, but let's try another example.

2. **12°C → 53.6°F**:
   - Celsius: 12
   - Reverse the digits: 21
   - 12°C is actually 53.6°F, not 21°F. This doesn't fit either.

3. **The Correct Example: 13.9°C → 57.0°F**:
   - Celsius: 13.9
   - Reverse the digits: 9.31 (not matching 57.0°F).
   - This also doesn't fit.

### Re-evaluating the Mnemonic:
Upon closer inspection, the mnemonic seems to work for only one specific temperature:
- **-40°C → -40°F**:
  - Celsius: -40
  - Reverse the digits: -04 (or -4)
  - -40°C is exactly -40°F, so the digits are the same (not inverted). This is a special case where Celsius and Fahrenheit are equal.

### Another Example (Less Accurate):
- **-17.8°C → 0°F**:
  - Celsius: -17.8
  - Reverse the digits: -87.1 (not matching 0°F).
  - This doesn't fit.

### Conclusion:
The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not entirely accurate or universally applicable. It seems to be a misinterpretation or oversimplification. The only exact match where Celsius and Fahrenheit are reverses is:
- **-40°C → -40°F** (digits are the same, not inverted).

### Better Mnemonic:
A more reliable shortcut is:
- To estimate Fahrenheit from Celsius, double the Celsius temperature, subtract 10%, and add 32.
  - Example: 20°C → 20 * 2 = 40 → 40 - 4 = 36 → 36 + 32 = 68°F (actual is 68°F).

### Final Answer:
The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not a reliable rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The only exact match where Celsius and Fahrenheit are reverses is -40°C and -40°F. For practical purposes, use the exact formula \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \) or the estimation method (double, subtract 10%, add 32). [end of text]
