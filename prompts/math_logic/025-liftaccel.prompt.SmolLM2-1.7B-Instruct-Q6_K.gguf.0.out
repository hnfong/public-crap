Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To answer these questions, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. To find the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the speed of the lift.

The total distance is the sum of the distances from the ground floor to each floor: 5 meters/floor * 40 floors = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given as 5 meters/second.

Now, we can calculate the time using the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 200 meters / 5 meters/second = 40 seconds.

So, it takes 40 seconds for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. To find the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor with two people getting on at different floors, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the speed of the lift.

The total distance is the sum of the distances from the ground floor to each floor: 5 meters/floor * 40 floors = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given as 5 meters/second.

Now, we can calculate the time using the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 200 meters / 5 meters/second = 40 seconds.

So, it takes 40 seconds for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor with two people getting on at different floors.

3. To find the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the speed of the lift.

The total distance is the sum of the distances from the ground floor to each floor: 5 meters/floor * 40 floors = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given as 5 meters/second.

However, we need to consider that the lift will stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the lift stops at 25/F.

The distance from the ground floor to 25/F is 25 meters.

The distance from 25/F to 40/F is 15 meters (40 - 25 = 15).

The total distance is the sum of these two distances: 25 meters + 15 meters = 40 meters.

Now, we can calculate the time using the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 40 meters / 5 meters/second = 8 seconds.

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 8 seconds. [end of text]
