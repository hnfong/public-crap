I'll do my best to answer each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. **Divisibility**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many divisors. In fact, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
2. **Geometry**: 120 is the number of degrees in a third of a circle (360° / 3 = 120°). This makes it a fundamental angle in geometry, particularly in the construction of equilateral triangles and hexagons.
3. **Mathematical constants**: 120 is closely related to the mathematical constant e (Euler's number). Specifically, 120 is the denominator of the 5th term in the continued fraction representation of e.
4. **Numerology**: In some cultures, 120 is considered a sacred or symbolic number, representing completeness, perfection, or unity (e.g., 120 years is considered a complete lifespan in some traditions).

These are just a few examples of the interesting properties and significance of the number 120.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x - 9) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Distance per round trip**: Since the train travels between two cities, a round trip covers a distance of 2 × 200 km = 400 km.
2. **Time per round trip**: With an average speed of 60 km/h, the time taken for a round trip is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes)
3. **Number of round trips in a day**: A full day has 24 hours. To find the number of round trips, we'll divide the total hours by the time per round trip:
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours per round trip ≈ 3.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
