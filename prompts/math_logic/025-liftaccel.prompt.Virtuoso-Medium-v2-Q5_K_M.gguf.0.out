1. To find the time it takes for the elevator to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance traveled.

First, let's find the time it takes for the elevator to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s. We can use the formula:

v = u + at

where v is the final velocity (5 m/s), u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration (1 m/s^2), and t is the time.

5 = 0 + 1t
t = 5 seconds

Now, let's find the distance traveled during this acceleration phase:

s = ut + 0.5at^2

s = 0 + 0.5(1)(5^2)
s = 12.5 meters

Since the elevator has to travel 40 floors, and each floor is 5 meters tall, the total distance is:

40 * 5 = 200 meters

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the elevator to travel the remaining distance at its maximum speed:

remaining distance = 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 meters

time = distance / speed
time = 187.5 / 5
time = 37.5 seconds

Finally, we need to consider the deceleration phase. Since the deceleration is the same as the acceleration (1 m/s^2), the time and distance for deceleration will be the same as for acceleration:

deceleration time = 5 seconds
deceleration distance = 12.5 meters

Now, we can add up all the times:

total time = acceleration time + constant speed time + deceleration time
total time = 5 + 37.5 + 5
total time = 47.5 seconds

So, it takes 47.5 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. For the second question, we need to consider the time it takes for the elevator to reach the 10th floor and then the 30th floor.

First, let's find the time it takes to reach the 10th floor:

distance to 10th floor = 10 * 5 = 50 meters

Using the same method as in question 1, we can find the time it takes to reach the 10th floor:

acceleration time = 5 seconds
acceleration distance = 12.5 meters

remaining distance = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters

constant speed time = 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds

deceleration time = 5 seconds
deceleration distance = 12.5 meters

time to 10th floor = 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 30th floor from the 10th floor:

distance between 10th and 30th floor = 20 * 5 = 100 meters

Using the same method as before:

acceleration time = 5 seconds
acceleration distance = 12.5 meters

remaining distance = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters

constant speed time = 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds

deceleration time = 5 seconds
deceleration distance = 12.5 meters

time between 10th and 30th floor = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds

Finally, we can add up the times:

total time = time to 10th floor + time between 10th and 30th floor
total time = 17.5 + 27.5
total time = 45 seconds

So, it takes 45 seconds for the elevator to reach the 10th floor and then the 30th floor.

3. For the third question, we need to find the minimum time it takes for the elevator to reach the 40th floor while stopping at another floor between 1st and 40th floor.

To minimize the time, the elevator should stop at the floor closest to the 40th floor. In this case, it would be the 39th floor.

Let's find the time it takes to reach the 39th floor:

distance to 39th floor = 39 * 5 = 195 meters

Using the same method as before:

acceleration time = 5 seconds
acceleration distance = 12.5 meters

remaining distance = 195 - 12.5 = 182.5 meters

constant speed time = 182.5 / 5 = 36.5 seconds

deceleration time = 5 seconds
deceleration distance = 12.5 meters

time to 39th floor = 5 + 36.5 + 5 = 46.5 seconds

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 40th floor from the 39th floor:

distance between 39th and 40th floor = 5 meters

Using the same method as before:

acceleration time = 5 seconds
acceleration distance = 12.5 meters

remaining distance = 5 - 12.5 = -7.5 meters (negative because the elevator has already traveled past the 40th floor)

constant speed time = 0 seconds (since the elevator has already passed the 40th floor)

deceleration time = 5 seconds
deceleration distance = 12.5 meters

time between 39th and 40th floor = 5 + 0 + 5 = 10 seconds

Finally, we can add up the times:

total time = time to 39th floor + time between 39th and 40th floor
total time = 46.5 + 10
total time = 56.5 seconds

So, the minimum time it takes for the elevator to reach the 40th floor while stopping at another floor between 1st and 40th floor is 56.5 seconds. [end of text]
