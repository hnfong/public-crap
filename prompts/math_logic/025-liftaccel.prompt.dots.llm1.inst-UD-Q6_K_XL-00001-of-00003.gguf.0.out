### Understanding the Problem

First, let's break down the problem to understand all the given information and what's being asked.

**Building Details:**
- There's a 40-story building.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall.
  
This means the total height (H) the elevator needs to travel from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) is:
\[ H = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ m/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

**Elevator Specifications:**
1. **Acceleration/Deceleration:** The elevator can accelerate at 1 m/s² and decelerate at 1 m/s².
2. **Maximum Speed:** The elevator's maximum speed is 5 m/s.

**Questions:**
1. Time taken for a single trip from 1/F to 40/F.
2. Time taken when two people get on at 1/F, one going to 10/F and the other to 30/F.
3. Minimum time to reach 40/F when two people get on at 1/F, one going to 40/F, and the other to any other floor between 1/F and 40/F, assuming they don't both go to 40/F.

### Solving Question 1: Single Trip from 1/F to 40/F

To find the time taken for the elevator to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the elevator's motion. Typically, the elevator will:
1. Start from rest, accelerate until it reaches its maximum speed or needs to start decelerating.
2. Travel at maximum speed for some time.
3. Decelerate to a stop at the destination floor.

Given that the total height is 200 meters, let's calculate the time taken.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration.**

The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches 5 m/s.

Time to reach maximum speed (t_accel):
\[ v = u + a \cdot t \]
\[ 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \]
\[ t_{accel} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

Distance covered during acceleration (s_accel):
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]
\[ s_{accel} = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

Similarly, the elevator will decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 over 5 seconds, covering the same distance of 12.5 meters.

**Step 2: Check if the elevator reaches maximum speed before needing to decelerate.**

Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration:
\[ s_{accel} + s_{decel} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \text{ meters} \]

Total height is 200 meters, so the remaining distance is:
\[ 200 - 25 = 175 \text{ meters} \]

At maximum speed, the elevator would cover 175 meters. Time at max speed:
\[ t_{max} = \frac{s_{max}}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 3: Total time calculation.**

Time during acceleration: 5 s
Time at max speed: 35 s
Time during deceleration: 5 s

Total time:
\[ t_{total} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

**Verification:**

Let me verify if the elevator can actually reach max speed before needing to decelerate.

The elevator accelerates for 5 s to reach 5 m/s, covering 12.5 m.
Then it travels at 5 m/s for as long as possible.
Then it decelerates for 5 s, covering another 12.5 m.

Total distance at max speed is 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 m.
Time at max speed: 175 / 5 = 35 s.
Total time: 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 s.

This seems correct.

**Alternative Scenario: What if the elevator doesn't reach max speed before needing to decelerate?**

This would happen if the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is more than half the total distance. But here, 25 m is much less than 200 m, so the elevator does reach max speed.

### Solving Question 2: Two People Going to 10/F and 30/F

Now, two people get on at 1/F. One goes to 10/F, the other to 30/F. The elevator needs to stop at both floors.

**Understanding the Stops:**
- The elevator starts at 1/F.
- First stop is at 10/F (50 meters: 10 × 5).
- Second stop is at 30/F (150 meters: 30 × 5).

The elevator will:
1. Go from 1/F to 10/F.
2. Then from 10/F to 30/F.

We need to calculate the time for each segment.

**Segment 1: 1/F to 10/F (50 meters)**

Again, the elevator accelerates to max speed if possible, then travels at max speed, then decelerates to stop at 10/F.

Distance during acceleration and deceleration: 12.5 m each.
Total distance: 50 m.
Distance at max speed: 50 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 25 m.

Time to accelerate: 5 s (to reach 5 m/s).
Distance at max speed: 25 m.
Time at max speed: 25 / 5 = 5 s.
Time to decelerate: 5 s.

Total time for segment 1: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 s.

**Segment 2: 10/F to 30/F (100 meters)**

Now, the elevator is at 10/F (50 m from start). It needs to go to 30/F, which is 150 m from start, so 100 m from current position.

Again, it will accelerate, possibly reach max speed, then decelerate.

Distance during acceleration and deceleration: 12.5 m each.
Distance at max speed: 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 m.
Time at max speed: 75 / 5 = 15 s.
Time to accelerate: 5 s.
Time to decelerate: 5 s.

Total time for segment 2: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 s.

**Total Time:**
15 s (1/F to 10/F) + 25 s (10/F to 30/F) = 40 s.

**Verification:**

Let me check if the elevator reaches max speed in both segments.

- Segment 1: 50 m total.
  - Accelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s.
  - Max speed: 25 m in 5 s.
  - Decelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s.
  - Total: 15 s. Correct.

- Segment 2: 100 m total.
  - Accelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s.
  - Max speed: 75 m in 15 s.
  - Decelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s.
  - Total: 25 s. Correct.

Total time: 15 + 25 = 40 s.

### Solving Question 3: Minimum Time to Reach 40/F with a Stop in Between

Now, two people get on at 1/F. One goes to 40/F (200 m), and the other goes to any other floor (not 40/F). The elevator must stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F before reaching
