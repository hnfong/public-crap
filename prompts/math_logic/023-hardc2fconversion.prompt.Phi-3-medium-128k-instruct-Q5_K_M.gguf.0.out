"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
 This statement is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. It's not entirely accurate, but it can be useful for some temperature ranges.

The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are related by the formula:

F = (9/5)C + 32

Where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.

The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to the fact that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are reversed. This is not a perfect rule, but it can be helpful for remembering some common conversions.

Here are some examples:

1. 0°C = 32°F: The digits are not inverted, but this is the freezing point of water in both scales.
2. 12°C = 53.6°F: The digits are inverted (12 and 53).
3. 24°C = 75.2°F: The digits are inverted (24 and 53).
4. 36°C = 96.8°F: The digits are inverted (36 and 63).
5. 48°C = 118.4°F: The digits are inverted (48 and 84).

As you can see, the mnemonic works for some temperatures, but not all. It's a helpful trick to remember some common conversions, but it's always best to use the actual formula for precise conversions.
