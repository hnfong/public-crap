Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4937
Q4: 349*683=235217
Q5: 6043*7489=45183037
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20.
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you $30 in change. (You gave $40, the book costs $15, so the change is $40 - $15 = $25. She initially gave you $20, so she still owes you $5. Then you give her an additional $5, so she gives you back $25.)
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units. (Perimeter = 4 * side length)
Q10: Katherine's mother has 4 children. (Katherine, her two brothers, and her sister)
Q11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: If each guest eats one slice of cake, they need 5 slices.
Q13: A shirt that's 20% off of $25 is $20. (20% of $25 is $5, so the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20)
Q14: There are 45 minutes left until 6:30 PM. (6:30 PM - 3:45 PM = 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes. 165 minutes - 35 minutes (the current time) = 130 minutes)
Q15: 22 people divided by 4 passengers per taxi equals 5.5, so you would need 6 taxis to accommodate everyone (since you can't have half a taxi, you round up).
Q16: The third angle in a triangle measures 207 degrees. (The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so 180 - (31+62) = 87 degrees)

For Q16, it seems there might be an error, as the sum of the angles in a triangle should not exceed 180 degrees. Let's recalculate:

The sum of the two given angles is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. Therefore, the third angle should be 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.

(Note: If this scenario was meant to be a different type of triangle, such as a straight angle or a polygon, it would need a different approach. However, for a standard triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees.)<|end|>
