"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This phrase is a trick to help remember how to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
F = (C * 9/5) + 32

However, the phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a simple way to remember that when the temperature in Celsius increases by 12 degrees, the Fahrenheit equivalent has the digits flipped. For example:

12°C = 53.6°F
24°C = 75.2°F
36°C = 96.8°F

Notice that the Fahrenheit numbers have the same digits as the Celsius temperatures but flipped (e.g., 53.6, 75.2, 96.8). This trick is not always perfectly accurate, but it's a helpful approximation for remembering the conversion.
