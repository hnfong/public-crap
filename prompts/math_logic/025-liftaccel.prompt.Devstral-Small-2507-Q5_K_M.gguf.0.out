Let's solve these questions step by step.

**1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

First, we need to calculate the total distance the lift travels. Since each floor is 5 meters tall and there are 40 floors, the total distance is:

Total distance = Number of floors × Height per floor
Total distance = 40 floors × 5 meters/floor
Total distance = 200 meters

The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s. We can calculate the time it takes to reach this speed using the formula:

v = u + at

where:
v = final velocity (5 m/s)
u = initial velocity (0 m/s)
a = acceleration (1 m/s²)
t = time

5 m/s = 0 m/s + (1 m/s²)t
t = 5 seconds

Now, we need to calculate the distance covered during this acceleration phase:

s = ut + 0.5at²

where:
s = distance
u = initial velocity (0 m/s)
a = acceleration (1 m/s²)
t = time (5 seconds)

s = (0 m/s)(5 s) + 0.5(1 m/s²)(5 s)²
s = 12.5 meters

The lift then travels at its maximum speed of 5 m/s for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 200 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 187.5 meters

The time taken to cover this remaining distance at maximum speed is:

t = distance / speed
t = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s
t = 37.5 seconds

Finally, the lift decelerates at 1 m/s² until it comes to a stop. The time taken to decelerate is the same as the time taken to accelerate, which is 5 seconds.

So, the total time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor is:

Total time = Time to accelerate + Time at maximum speed + Time to decelerate
Total time = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total time = 47.5 seconds

**2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

First, we calculate the time it takes for the lift to reach the 10th floor. The distance to the 10th floor is:

Distance to 10/F = Number of floors × Height per floor
Distance to 10/F = 10 floors × 5 meters/floor
Distance to 10/F = 50 meters

The lift accelerates for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to the 10th floor is:

Remaining distance to 10/F = Distance to 10/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance to 10/F = 50 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance to 10/F = 37.5 meters

The time taken to cover this remaining distance at maximum speed is:

t = distance / speed
t = 37.5 meters / 5 m/s
t = 7.5 seconds

So, the total time taken for the lift to reach the 10th floor is:

Total time to 10/F = Time to accelerate + Time at maximum speed
Total time to 10/F = 5 seconds + 7.5 seconds
Total time to 10/F = 12.5 seconds

Now, the lift needs to go from the 10th floor to the 30th floor. The distance between these floors is:

Distance between 10/F and 30/F = Number of floors × Height per floor
Distance between 10/F and 30/F = 20 floors × 5 meters/floor
Distance between 10/F and 30/F = 100 meters

The lift accelerates again for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. The remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Distance between 10/F and 30/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 100 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 87.5 meters

The time taken to cover this remaining distance at maximum speed is:

t = distance / speed
t = 87.5 meters / 5 m/s
t = 17.5 seconds

Finally, the lift decelerates for 5 seconds.

So, the total time taken for the lift to go from the 10th floor to the 30th floor is:

Total time from 10/F to 30/F = Time to accelerate + Time at maximum speed + Time to decelerate
Total time from 10/F to 30/F = 5 seconds + 17.5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total time from 10/F to 30/F = 27.5 seconds

Therefore, the total time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to the 30th floor, stopping at the 10th floor, is:

Total time = Total time to 10/F + Total time from 10/F to 30/F
Total time = 12.5 seconds + 27.5 seconds
Total time = 40 seconds

**3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the 40th floor. Since the second person does not go to the 40th floor, the closest floor the lift can stop at is the 39th floor.

First, we calculate the time it takes for the lift to reach the 39th floor. The distance to the 39th floor is:

Distance to 39/F = Number of floors × Height per floor
Distance to 39/F = 39 floors × 5 meters/floor
Distance to 39/F = 195 meters

The lift accelerates for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to the 39th floor is:

Remaining distance to 39/F = Distance to 39/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance to 39/F = 195 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance to 39/F = 182.5 meters

The time taken to cover this remaining distance at maximum speed is:

t = distance / speed
t = 182.5 meters / 5 m/s
t = 36.5 seconds

So, the total time taken for the lift to reach the 39th floor is:

Total time to 39/F = Time to accelerate + Time at maximum speed
Total time to 39/F = 5 seconds + 36.5 seconds
Total time to 39/F = 41.5 seconds

Now, the lift needs to go from the 39th floor to the 40th floor. The distance between these floors is:

Distance between 39/F and 40/F = Number of floors × Height per floor
Distance between 39/F and 40/F = 1 floor × 5 meters/floor
Distance between 39/F and 40/F = 5 meters

Since this distance is less than the distance the lift covers during acceleration (12.5 meters), the lift will decelerate directly from its maximum speed to a stop at the 40th floor. The time taken to decelerate is:

t = v / a
t = 5 m/s / 1 m/s²
t = 5 seconds

Therefore, the total time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to the 40th floor, stopping at the 39th floor,
