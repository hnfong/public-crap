Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: 1+1=?. That's straightforward, right? 1 plus 1 equals 2. I'm pretty confident about that.

Q2 is 6*7. Multiplying 6 by 7... 6 times 7 is 42. Yep, that's correct.

Q3: 83*59. Hmm, let me calculate that. 80*50 is 4000, 80*9 is 720, 3*50 is 150, and 3*9 is 27. Adding them up: 4000 + 720 = 4720, 4720 + 150 = 4870, 4870 +27=4897. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Alternatively, 83*60=4980, subtract 83 gives 4980-83=4897. Yes, that's correct. So 4897.

Q4: 349*683. This is a bigger multiplication. Let me break it down. 300*600=180,000; 300*83=24,900; 49*600=29,400; 49*83. Let's compute 49*80=3,920 and 49*3=147, so 3,920+147=4,067. Now adding all parts: 180,000 +24,900=204,900; 204,900 +29,400=234,300; 234,300 +4,067=238,367. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 349*683. Let's compute 349*600=209,400; 349*80=27,920; 349*3=1,047. Adding them: 209,400 +27,920=237,320; 237,320 +1,047=238,367. Yes, same result. So 238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489. That's a huge multiplication. Maybe using the distributive property. Let's see: 6000*7000=42,000,000; 6000*489=2,934,000; 43*7000=301,000; 43*489. Let's compute 40*489=19,560 and 3*489=1,467, so 19,560+1,467=21,027. Now adding all parts: 42,000,000 +2,934,000=44,934,000; 44,934,000 +301,000=45,235,000; 45,235,000 +21,027=45,256,027. Wait, maybe I should check again. Alternatively, 6043*7000=42,301,000; 6043*400=2,417,200; 6043*80=483,440; 6043*9=54,387. Adding them: 42,301,000 +2,417,200=44,718,200; 44,718,200 +483,440=45,201,640; 45,201,640 +54,387=45,256,027. Yes, same result. So 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve 3x +7 =22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x=15, then x=5. Correct.

Q7: 25% of 80. 25% is a quarter, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So 20.

Q8: Buying a $15 book with two $20 bills (total $40) and needing change. The shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so the customer gives an additional $5. So total given is $40 + $5 = $45. The book is $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but if the shopkeeper didn't have exact change initially, maybe she can't give back the correct amount? Wait, the problem says she doesn't have exact change for the initial $20, so the customer gives an extra $5. So the total payment is $20 + $20 + $5 = $45. The price is $15, so change is $45 - $15 = $30. So the shopkeeper should give $30. But maybe the problem is different. Let me read again: "I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill." So the customer gives 20+20=40, but the book is $15. So the shopkeeper needs to give back 40-15=25. But she doesn't have exact change (maybe she can't make 25 with her coins?), so the customer gives an extra $5, making total payment 45. Then the change is 45-15=30. So yes, $30.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side 5 units. Perimeter is 4*side, so 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? So Katherine plus two brothers and one sister: 1+2+1=4. So the mother has 4 children.

Q11: 3 +12 รท4 -1. Order of operations: division first. 12 รท4=3. Then 3 +3 -1=5. So 5.

Q12: 5 guests have arrived. How many cake slices? Assuming each guest gets one slice, so 5 slices. But maybe it's more? The problem doesn't specify, but typically each guest gets a slice. So 5 slices.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. 20% of 25 is
