The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device used to help people remember the conversion between the two temperature scales. Here's an explanation with examples:

1. **Understanding the Conversion**: 
   - Celsius (°C) is a metric unit of temperature.
   - Fahrenheit (°F) is another metric unit of temperature, but it uses a different set of units for the digits.

2. **Mnemonic Device**:
   - The mnemonic device involves associating a specific number of degrees Celsius with a specific number of degrees Fahrenheit, using the fact that 1°C is equivalent to 1°F.

3. **Example**:
   - Let's say you want to convert 20°C to Fahrenheit.
   - According to the mnemonic, every 12°C, the digits are inverted. So, 20°C is equivalent to 20°F because 20°C is 20°F when the digits are inverted.

4. **Verification**:
   - To verify, you can use the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit: 
     \[
     F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
     \]
   - For 20°C:
     \[
     F = \frac{9}{5} \times 20 + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104°F
     \]
   - This confirms that 20°C is indeed 104°F when the digits are inverted.

By using this mnemonic, you can quickly remember the conversion formula and the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit without having to memorize the conversion steps. [end of text]
