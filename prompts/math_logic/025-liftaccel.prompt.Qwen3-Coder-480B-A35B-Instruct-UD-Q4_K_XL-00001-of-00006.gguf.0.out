I'll solve each question step by step.

First, let me establish the basic information:
- Building has 40 stories
- Each floor is 5 meters tall
- Total height = 40 × 5 = 200 meters
- Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s²
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s

Let me also calculate the time and distance for acceleration/deceleration:
- Time to reach max speed: t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds
- Distance to reach max speed: s = ½at² = ½(1)(5)² = 12.5 meters

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

For a 200-meter trip:
- Distance needed to accelerate: 12.5 meters
- Distance needed to decelerate: 12.5 meters
- Distance at maximum speed: 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters

Time calculation:
- Time to accelerate: 5 seconds
- Time at max speed: 175/5 = 35 seconds
- Time to decelerate: 5 seconds

Total time = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

The lift will go to the higher floor (30/F), so I need to calculate the time to reach 30/F.

Distance to 30/F = 30 × 5 = 150 meters

For a 150-meter trip:
- Distance needed to accelerate: 12.5 meters
- Distance needed to decelerate: 12.5 meters
- Distance at maximum speed: 150 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 125 meters

Time calculation:
- Time to accelerate: 5 seconds
- Time at max speed: 125/5 = 25 seconds
- Time to decelerate: 5 seconds

Total time = 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 seconds

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize time, the lift should stop at the floor that requires the least additional time. The optimal strategy is to stop at a floor where the lift doesn't need to come to a complete stop, or where the stop adds minimal time.

However, since the lift must stop at another floor, I need to consider where to make the stop most efficient.

The minimum additional time would occur if the lift stops at a floor that's on its way up and where it's already traveling at maximum speed, so it doesn't need significant deceleration.

Let's say the lift stops at floor 20/F (100 meters up):
- Distance from ground to 20/F: 100 meters
- Distance from 20/F to 40/F: 100 meters

For the first segment (0 to 20/F, 100 meters):
- Accelerate: 12.5 meters in 5 seconds
- Max speed: 100 - 25 = 75 meters in 75/5 = 15 seconds
- Decelerate: 12.5 meters in 5 seconds
- Total: 25 seconds (including stop time)

For the second segment (20/F to 40/F, 100 meters):
- Accelerate: 12.5 meters in 5 seconds
- Max speed: 75 meters in 15 seconds
- Decelerate: 12.5 meters in 5 seconds
- Total: 25 seconds

However, if we consider that at floor 20/F, the lift is already at max speed, it might not need to decelerate completely. But since it must stop, let's assume a minimal stop.

Actually, let me reconsider the most efficient stop. The minimum time would be if we stop at the floor that minimizes the additional time due to stopping.

The most efficient approach is to stop at the floor closest to where the lift would naturally be at maximum speed. 

For the 200-meter journey to 40/F:
- Acceleration distance: 12.5 meters (5 seconds)
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 meters (5 seconds)
- Maximum speed distance: 175 meters

The lift reaches maximum speed at 12.5 meters (2.5 floors) and maintains it until 187.5 meters (37.5 floors).

To minimize additional time, we should stop at a floor within this maximum speed section, ideally near the middle.

Let's say we stop at floor 20/F (100 meters):
- Time to reach 100 meters: Since 100 > 12.5, the lift reaches max speed
- Accelerate: 5 seconds to reach 5 m/s
- Travel at max speed: (100-12.5)/5 = 17.5 seconds
- Decelerate to stop: 5 seconds
- Stop time: Let's assume 10 seconds for doors and passenger movement
- Accelerate from stop: 5 seconds
- Travel remaining 100 meters: 25 seconds (same as first 100 meters)

Wait, let me recalculate more carefully.

The stop will add time for deceleration, stopping, and re-acceleration.

Minimum time scenario - stop at floor 20/F:
1. Ground to 20/F (100m):
   - Accelerate: 5 seconds
   - Max speed: (100-25)/5 = 15 seconds
   - Decelerate: 5 seconds
   - Total: 25 seconds

2. Stop time at 20/F: Let's assume 15 seconds minimum

3. 20/F to 40/F (100m):
   - Accelerate: 5 seconds
   - Max speed: 15 seconds
   - Decelerate: 5 seconds
   - Total: 25 seconds

Total time = 25 + 15 + 25 = 65 seconds

But this is longer than the direct trip (45 seconds). The question asks for the minimum time WITH a required stop.

The minimum time with a required stop would be 45 seconds + minimum stop time overhead.

However, if the stop is made optimally (at maximum speed section), the additional time would be:
- Time lost from decelerating: 5 seconds
- Stop time: 15 seconds
- Time to re-accelerate: 5 seconds
- Additional travel time due to speed change: 0 seconds (if we stop at max speed section)

Minimum additional time = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds

Therefore, minimum time = 45 + 25 = 70 seconds

**Answers:**
1. 45 seconds
2. 35 seconds
3. 70 seconds [end of text]
