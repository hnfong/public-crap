**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting mathematical and practical properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1  
   This makes it the factorial of 5.

2. **Highly composite number**: 120 has 12 positive divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 — actually 16 divisors. Wait, let me count again:  
   Prime factorization: 120 = 2³ × 3¹ × 5¹  
   Number of divisors = (3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4 × 2 × 2 = 16 divisors.

3. **Highly abundant number**: The sum of its divisors (including itself) is σ(120) = (1+2+4+8)(1+3)(1+5) = 15 × 4 × 6 = 360, which is quite large relative to 120.

4. **Practical number**: Every smaller positive integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of 120.

5. **Sum of consecutive integers**:  
   120 = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 (sum of first 15 natural numbers)  
   Also, 120 = 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 (sum of 5 consecutive integers)

6. **Sum of consecutive primes**:  
   120 = 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 (sum of 6 consecutive primes)

7. **In geometry**: A regular icosahedron has 120 rotational symmetries.

8. **In time**: 120 seconds = 2 minutes; 120 minutes = 2 hours.

9. **In measurement**: 120 degrees is the internal angle of a regular hexagon.

10. **In music**: 120 BPM (beats per minute) is a common tempo.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

Let's try factoring first.

We need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Let's list factor pairs of -18:
- 1 and -18 → sum = -17  
- -1 and 18 → sum = 17  
- 2 and -9 → sum = -7 ✅  
- -2 and 9 → sum = 7  
- 3 and -6 → sum = -3  
- -3 and 6 → sum = 3

So, 2 and -9 work.

Now rewrite the middle term:
x² + 2x - 9x - 18 = 0  
Group terms:  
(x² + 2x) + (-9x - 18) = 0  
Factor:  
x(x + 2) - 9(x + 2) = 0  
(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Set each factor to zero:
- x - 9 = 0 → x = 9  
- x + 2 = 0 → x = -2

✅ **Solutions: x = 9 and x = -2**

Verification using quadratic formula:  
x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± √121] / 2 = [7 ± 11] / 2  
→ (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9  
→ (7 - 11)/2 = -4/2 = -2  
Same results.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Let's break it down:

- Distance between cities: 200 km  
- One-way distance: 200 km  
- Round trip distance: 200 × 2 = 400 km  
- Speed: 60 km/h  
- Time for one round trip = distance / speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666... hours

A full day = 24 hours

Number of round trips = total time available / time per round trip  
= 24 / (20/3) = 24 × 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6

Since the train can only complete whole round trips (we can't count a partial round trip), we take the integer part.

✅ **Answer: 3 full round trips**

Let me double-check:  
- 1 round trip: 400 km → 400/60 = 6h 40min  
- 3 round trips: 3 × 6h 40min = 20 hours  
- 4 round trips: 4 × 6h 40min = 26h 40min > 24 hours

So yes, only 3 full round trips in 24 hours.
