The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic or a shortcut to help remember the relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) temperatures at specific points. 

### Explanation:
The phrase suggests that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit are "inverted" (i.e., reversed). This works for certain specific temperatures where the numerical values of °C and °F are reverses of each other.

### Examples:
1. **24°C and 42°F**:
   - 24°C is equivalent to 75.2°F (using the exact formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)), but the mnemonic approximates it as 42°F. Here, the digits "24" are inverted to "42". This is not exact but close enough for a rough estimate.

2. **12°C and 21°F**:
   - 12°C is equivalent to 53.6°F, but the mnemonic approximates it as 21°F. The digits "12" are inverted to "21". Again, this is not exact but serves as a rough guide.

3. **-8°C and -18°F**:
   - -8°C is equivalent to 17.6°F, but the mnemonic suggests -18°F (inverting "-8" to "-18"). This is not exact but illustrates the pattern.

### Limitations:
- This mnemonic is not precise and only works for a few specific temperatures. For example:
  - 0°C is exactly 32°F (no inversion here).
  - 100°C is exactly 212°F (no inversion here either).
- The exact formula for conversion is \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \), and the mnemonic is just a rough approximation.

### Why It Might Be Useful:
For quick mental estimates, this trick can help you remember that certain Celsius temperatures roughly correspond to their digit-inverted Fahrenheit values. However, it's not reliable for precise calculations.

### Better Mnemonic:
A more accurate and widely used mnemonic is:
- "At -40°, Celsius and Fahrenheit are equal."
- "0°C is 32°F (freezing point of water)."
- "100°C is 212°F (boiling point of water)."

But the original statement is a fun, albeit imprecise, way to remember a few specific conversions. [end of text]
