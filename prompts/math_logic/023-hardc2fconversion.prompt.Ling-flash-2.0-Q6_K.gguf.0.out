Let's break down the statement:

> **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."**

This is a **mnemonic trick** to help estimate or remember the **conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit** temperatures. It's not perfectly accurate, but it can be a helpful approximation for certain values.

---

### 🔍 Understanding the Statement

Let’s first recall the **exact formula** to convert Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F):

$$
°F = °C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32
$$

So, for example:
- 0°C = 32°F
- 10°C = 50°F
- 20°C = 68°F
- 30°C = 86°F
- etc.

Now, the **mnemonic** says:
> "Every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This suggests that **at certain Celsius temperatures**, the Fahrenheit value is roughly the **reverse of the digits** of the Celsius value.

Let’s test this.

### 🧪 Examples

Let’s look at **12°C**:

- Convert to Fahrenheit:
  $$
  12 \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F
  $$

So 12°C ≈ 53.6°F.  
Digits of 12 → "12"  
Digits of 53.6 → roughly "54" → not a perfect inversion.

But if we **ignore decimals**, 53.6 ≈ 54. Still not a clear inversion.

Wait — maybe the **key is around 12°C**, not exactly at 12°C.

Let’s look at **16°C**:

- 16°C = (16 × 1.8) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F  
Digits: 16 → 61 → **inverted!**

So 16°C ≈ 61°F → digits reversed.

Similarly:
- **25°C** = (25 × 1.8) + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77°F → 25 → 77? Not reversed.
Wait, 25 → 77 is not a reversal.

Wait, let's try **24°C**:
- 24°C = (24 × 1.8) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2 ≈ 75°F  
24 → 75? Not reversed.

Wait, let's go back to **16°C = ~61°F**  
16 → 61 → reversed digits.

What about **25°C**?

- 25°C = 77°F → 25 vs 77 → not reversed.

Wait, maybe **28°C**:
- 28°C = (28 × 1.8) + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4 ≈ 82°F  
28 → 82 → **reversed digits!**

So 28°C ≈ 82°F → digits reversed.

Similarly:
- **37°C** = (37 × 1.8) + 32 = 66.6 + 32 = 98.6 ≈ 99°F  
37 → 99 → not reversed.

Wait, 37°C ≈ 98.6°F → close to 99, but not reversed.

Wait, **what about 41°C?**
- 41°C = (41 × 1.8) + 32 = 73.8 + 32 = 105.8°F → too high.

Wait, let's go back.

We saw:
- 16°C ≈ 61°F → 16 ↔ 61
- 28°C ≈ 82°F → 28 ↔ 82
- What about **61°C**?
  - 61°C = (61 × 1.8) + 32 = 109.8 + 32 = 141.8°F → not 16°F

So the inversion is **one-way** — not symmetric.

But the mnemonic says: **every 12°C**, the digits are inverted.

So maybe the idea is that **every 12°C increase**, the Fahrenheit value is roughly the reverse of the Celsius digits.

Let’s test:

- Start at **16°C = ~61°F**
- Add 12°C → 28°C = ~82°F → 28 ↔ 82 ✅
- Add 12°C → 40°C = (40 × 1.8) + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104°F → 40 vs 104 → not reversed
- Hmm, breaks down here.

So maybe the mnemonic is only approximate and works for **some** values.

### ✅ Summary of the Mnemonic

> **"Every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** means:
- At certain Celsius temperatures (like 16°C, 28°C), the Fahrenheit value is approximately the **reverse of the digits** of the Celsius temperature.
- This is a **memory aid**, not an exact rule.
- It helps you **estimate** Fahrenheit from Celsius for a few key values.

### 🧠 Examples

| Celsius (°C) | Fahrenheit (°F) | Is it reversed? |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| 16°C         | ~61°F            | ✅ 16 → 61       |
| 28°C         | ~82°F            | ✅ 28 → 82       |
| 40°C         | ~104°F           | ❌ 40 → 104 (not reversed) |
| 12°C         | ~54°F            | ❌ 12 → 54 (not reversed) |
| 25°C         | ~77°F            | ❌ 25 → 77       |
| 61°C         | ~142°F           | ❌ 61 → 142      |

So the rule works **only for some values**, like 16°C and 28°C.

### 🧩 Why 12°C?

Maybe the **12°C** is a **starting point** or a **reference**. For example:
- 12°C is close to 54°F (not reversed), but nearby 16°C is 61°F.
- So maybe the mnemonic is loosely saying: "Every 12°C interval, look for a reversed-digit approximation."

Alternatively, it could be a **misremembered version** of a better-known trick.

### 🧠 Alternative Mnemonics

A more common one is:
> "30°C is 86°F"  
> "20°C is 68°F"  
> "40°C is 104°F"

Or:
> "Double the °C, add 30 to estimate °F"  
(e.g., 20°C → 40 + 30 = 70°F — actual is 68°F, close)

But the **digit inversion** trick is less standard, but still useful for **16°C → 61°F** and **28°C → 82°F**.

### ✅ Final Answer (Restated Clearly)

> The phrase **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is a **mnemonic trick** to help remember approximate Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. It means that at certain Celsius temperatures (like 16°C and 28°C), the Fahrenheit temperature is roughly the **reverse of the digits** of the Celsius value.

#### 🔢 Examples:
- **16°C ≈ 61°F** → 16 and 61 are digit reverses
- **28°C ≈ 82°F** → 28 and 82 are digit reverses

This is **not exact** (actual conversion of 16°C is 60.8°F, 28°C is 82.4°F), but it's a
