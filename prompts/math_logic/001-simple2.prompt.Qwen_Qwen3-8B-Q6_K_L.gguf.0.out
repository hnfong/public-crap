### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step 1: Understand the number 120.**  
The number 120 is a positive integer.

**Step 2: Check if it is a factorial number.**  
120 = 5! (5 factorial) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120  
So, 120 is the factorial of 5.

**Step 3: Check if it is a highly composite number.**  
120 has many divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120  
It is a highly composite number because it has more divisors than any smaller number.

**Step 4: Check if it is a triangular number.**  
A triangular number is a number that can be represented as a triangle of dots.  
The formula for the nth triangular number is:  
$$ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$  
Try solving for n:  
$$ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 120 $$  
$$ n(n+1) = 240 $$  
Try n = 15:  
$$ 15 × 16 = 240 $$  
So, 120 is the 15th triangular number.

**Step 5: Check if it is a tetrahedral number.**  
A tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.  
The formula is:  
$$ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} $$  
Try n = 6:  
$$ \frac{6 × 7 × 8}{6} = 56 $$  
Try n = 8:  
$$ \frac{8 × 9 × 10}{6} = 120 $$  
So, 120 is the 8th tetrahedral number.

**Step 6: Check if it is a highly composite number.**  
Yes, as mentioned earlier.

**Step 7: Check if it is a multiple of many numbers.**  
120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

**Step 8: Check if it is a number with special significance in other contexts.**  
- In the Bible, 120 is the age at which Noah was when the flood began.
- In mathematics, 120 is the number of seconds in 2 minutes.
- In some cultures, 120 is considered a lucky number.

**Final Answer:**  
The number 120 is significant because it is:  
- The factorial of 5 (5! = 120)  
- A highly composite number  
- A triangular number (15th triangular number)  
- A tetrahedral number (8th tetrahedral number)  
- Divisible by many numbers (16 divisors)  
- Appears in various cultural and religious contexts

### **Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Step 1: Identify the equation.**  
The equation is a quadratic equation:  
$$ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $$

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**  
The quadratic formula is:  
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$  
Where:  
- a = 1  
- b = -7  
- c = -18

**Step 3: Plug in the values.**  
$$ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} $$  
$$ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} $$  
$$ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} $$  
$$ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} $$

**Step 4: Solve for the two roots.**  
- First root:  
$$ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $$  
- Second root:  
$$ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $$

**Final Answer:**  
The solutions to the equation are:  
$$ x = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 $$

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**  
- Distance between the two cities = 200 km  
- Speed of the train = 60 km/h  
- Time stationed in the cities = 0 (negligible)  
- Time in a full day = 24 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for one one-way trip.**  
$$ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} $$

**Step 3: Calculate the time for one round trip.**  
A round trip = 2 one-way trips  
$$ \text{Time for one round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} $$

**Step 4: Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours.**  
$$ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 $$

**Step 5: Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, round down.**  
So, the train can make **3 full round trips** in a full day.

**Final Answer:**  
The train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
