Q3: 83*59=?
**Answer:** 4897  
*(Because 83 × 59 = 83 × (60 - 1) = 4980 - 83 = 4897)*

Q4: 349*683=?
**Answer:** 238,267  
*(Let me verify: 349 × 683 = 349 × (600 + 80 + 3) = 349×600=209,400 + 349×80=27,920 + 349×3=1,047; sum = 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367. Wait, that's 238,367. Let me check again:  
349 × 683  
= 349 × (680 + 3)  
= 349 × 680 + 349 × 3  
349 × 680 = (349 × 68) × 10  
349 × 68 = (349 × 70) - (349 × 2) = 24,430 - 698 = 23,732  
So 23,732 × 10 = 237,320  
349 × 3 = 1,047  
Total = 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367  
So the correct answer is 238,367. I made a calculation error above.)*  
**Corrected Answer:** 238,367

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
**Answer:** $25  
*(You give 2×$20 = $40, then +$5 = $45 total. Book is $15, so change is $45 - $15 = $30. But since the shopkeeper didn't have exact change, you gave an extra $5 to make it easier, but the total change due is still $30. However, if you gave $45 and the book is $15, the shopkeeper must give you $30 back. The mention of "she does not have exact change" and you giving an extra $5 is just to explain why you gave more, but the change is still $30.)*  
**But let's clarify:**  
You pay $45 for a $15 book. The correct change is $30.  
**Answer:** $30

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
**Answer:** I am not sure, but I think the answer is it depends.

**More direct answer:** 5 slices

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
**Answer:** 165 minutes  
*(From 3:45 PM to 6:45 PM is 3 hours = 180 minutes. But we only want up to 6:30 PM, which is 15 minutes less.  
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM:  
From 3:45 to 4:00 = 15 min  
4:00 to 6:00 = 2 hours = 120 min  
6:00 to 6:30 = 30 min  
Total = 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes)*

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
**Answer:** 87 degrees  
*(Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°. 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87)* [end of text]
