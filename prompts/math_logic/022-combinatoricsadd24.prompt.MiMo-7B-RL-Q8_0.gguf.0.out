Okay, let's see. I need to create an expression using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once each, and combine them with mathematical operations (probably addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to get 24. Hmm. Let me start by recalling that 24 is a common target in these kinds of puzzles, so maybe there's a standard approach.

First, I should think about the factors of 24. Breaking it down, 24 can be 3 times 8, which is 24. But then how do I use the other numbers, 4 and 1? Alternatively, 4 times 6 is 24. Maybe I can get 6 from some combination. Or 24 divided by 1 is 24, but that might not help. Let's try different combinations.

Looking at the numbers: 8, 4, 3, 1. Let's see. If I take 8 minus 4, that's 4. Then multiply by (3 + 1), which is 4. So 4*4=16. That's too low. Wait, the example attempt got 16, so that's not right. Let's try another approach.

What if I use multiplication and division? For example, 8 divided by something. If I do 8 divided by (something) to get a higher number. Alternatively, 8 times 3 is 24. Then I need to use 4 and 1. But how? If I can subtract or add 4 and 1 in a way that cancels them out. For instance, 8*3 + (4 - 4) but that would require another 4. Wait, but we only have one 4. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe 8*(3 - 1) + 4. Let's calculate that: 8*(2) +4=16+4=20. Not enough. What if 8*(3 + 1) - 4? That would be 8*4 -4=32-4=28. Still not 24.

Wait, maybe using fractions. For example, 8/(something) times something else. Let's see. If I take 8/( (4/3) - 1 ), but that might be complicated. Let me compute that denominator: (4/3 -1)=1/3. Then 8 divided by (1/3) is 24. But then I need to use 4, 3, 1, 8. Wait, let's check:

8 / ( (4/3) - 1 ) = 8 / ( (4 - 3)/3 ) = 8 / (1/3) = 24. But here, I used 8, 4, 3, and 1. Wait, yes! Because (4/3) uses 4 and 3, then subtract 1. So the expression would be 8 divided by ( (4/3) - 1 ). Let me verify:

First, compute (4/3 -1) = (4/3 - 3/3) = 1/3. Then 8 divided by 1/3 is 24. So that works. But does that use each number exactly once? Let's see: 8 is used once, 4 once, 3 once, 1 once. Yes! So the expression is 8 / ( (4/3) - 1 ) = 24. But wait, in terms of operations, is that allowed? The problem says "construct a mathematical expression," so division is allowed. Let me check the calculation again:

(4/3) is 1.333..., subtract 1 gives 0.333..., then 8 divided by that is 24. Yes. So that works. But maybe there's a simpler way without fractions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe (8 - 1) * (3 + 4/ something). Wait, 8-1=7, 3+4=7, but that's 7*7=49. Not helpful. Or 8*(3 + 1) - 4* something. Wait, 8*4=32, 32 - 8=24. But how to get that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 4 * 6 =24. How can I get 6 from 8,3,1? Maybe 8 - (3 +1) =4, which is not helpful. Or (8 -3) +1=6. So 8-3=5, 5+1=6. Then 4*6=24. But how to write that using all four numbers. Let's see: 4 * ( (8 -3) +1 ) = 4*(6)=24. But here, we have 4,8,3,1. Yes! Each number used once. Let's check:

(8 -3) is 5, plus 1 is 6. 4*6=24. Yes! That works. So the expression is 4 * (8 -3 +1) =24. Wait, but 8-3+1 is 6, so 4*6=24. That uses all four numbers: 4,8,3,1. Each exactly once. Let me verify the calculation again:

8-3=5, 5+1=6, 4*6=24. Perfect. That seems straightforward. So why didn't I think of that earlier? Maybe because I was overcomplicating with division. So the correct expression is 4*(8 -3 +1) =24. Let me check if that uses all numbers: 4,8,3,1. Yes. Each once. Perfect.

Wait, but in the example attempts, the user tried (8-4)*(3+1)=16, which didn't work. Then tried 8*3+4-1=24, but that gave 27. Then tried 4*(8-3)+4=24, which used 4 twice. So the correct answer must be 4*(8 -3 +1). Let me confirm again:

4*(8 -3 +1) =4*(6)=24. Yes. So that's the solution. So the expression is 4 multiplied by (8 minus 3 plus 1). Which uses all four numbers exactly once. That should be the correct answer.

To solve the problem of creating an expression using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once each to equal 24, we can follow this step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify target factors**: 24 can be factored into 4 Ã— 6.  
2. **Determine how to get 6**: Using the remaining numbers (8, 3, 1), compute \(8 - 3 + 1 = 6\).  
3. **Combine with the remaining number**: Multiply the result by 4: \(4 \times 6 = 24\).  

**Final Expression**:  
\[
4 \times (8 - 3 + 1) = 24
\]

**Verification**:  
- Compute \(8 - 3 = 5\).  
- Add 1: \(5 + 1 = 6\).  
- Multiply by 4: \(4 \times 6 = 24\).  

This uses all numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) exactly once and results in 24.  

```
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24  
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct. Success!
```  

**Answer**:  
\boxed{4 \times (8 - 3 + 1) = 24} [end of text]
