Let's try to construct a mathematical expression using the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) to get the result 24.

```
Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) * (3 + 1) = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.
```

So, the correct expression is:
\[ (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24 \] [end of text]
