Let's address each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is significant in several contexts:

- **Mathematical Properties**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many factors. It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120 itself. This makes it useful in many mathematical calculations and divisions.
- **Number of Days in a Year**: 120 days is approximately 1/5 of a year, which is useful in calendars and time calculations.
- **Chemistry**: In chemistry, 120 is the atomic mass of the element Radium (Ra).
- **Geometry**: 120 is the number of degrees in a full circle, which is useful in geometry and trigonometry.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

3. Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   \[ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance for one round trip and then divide the total available time by this distance.

1. **Distance for one round trip**:
   \[ \text{Distance} = 2 \times 200 \text{ km} = 400 \text{ km} \]

2. **Time for one round trip**:
   \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \]

3. **Total available time in a full day**:
   \[ \text{Total time} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

4. **Number of round trips**:
   \[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per round trip}} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we take the integer part of 3.6, which is 3.

Therefore, the train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
