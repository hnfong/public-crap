Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is significant in several contexts, and it has some interesting properties:

1. **Divisibility**: 120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it a highly composite number, meaning it has many divisors.

2. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120). This makes it a special number in combinatorics and probability.

3. **Perfect Number**: 120 is not a perfect number, but it is related to perfect numbers. The sum of the divisors of 120 (excluding 120 itself) is 168, which is twice 84, and 84 is the sum of the divisors of 84 (excluding 84 itself).

4. **Number of Days in a Month**: In many calendars, a month is considered to have 30 days, and 120 days is approximately 3.33 months, which is a useful approximation for planning.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
   \[ \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):
   \[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   \[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance for one round trip and then divide the total available time by the time it takes for one round trip.

1. **Distance for one round trip**:
   \[ \text{Distance} = 2 \times 200 \text{ km} = 400 \text{ km} \]

2. **Time for one round trip**:
   \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \]

3. **Total available time in a full day**:
   \[ \text{Total time} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

4. **Number of round trips**:
   \[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time for one round trip}} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we take the integer part of 3.6, which is 3.

Therefore, the train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
