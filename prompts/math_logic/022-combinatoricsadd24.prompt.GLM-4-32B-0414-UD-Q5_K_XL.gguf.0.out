Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) * 1 = (8 / 1) * 1 = 8 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3 - 1)) = 8 * (4 - 2) = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) * (4 - 1) = 24 * 3 = 72, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 + 1) - 3 = 8 * 5 - 3 = 40 - 3 = 37, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Correct! [end of text]
