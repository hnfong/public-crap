Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. The lift/elevator travels a total distance of 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The lift/elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(200/1) = 14.14 seconds to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s.

The lift/elevator then travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for 200 meters - 5 m/s x 14.14 s = 100 meters.

The lift/elevator decelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(100/1) = 10 seconds to come to a stop.

Therefore, the total time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is 14.14 s + 10 s = 24.14 seconds.

2. The first person goes to 10/F, which is 50 meters away from the ground floor. The second person goes to 30/F, which is 150 meters away from the ground floor.

The lift/elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(50/1) = 7.07 seconds to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s.

The lift/elevator then travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for 50 meters - 5 m/s x 7.07 s = 0 meters.

The lift/elevator decelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(0/1) = 0 seconds to come to a stop.

Therefore, the total time it takes for the first person to get to 10/F is 7.07 s + 0 s = 7.07 seconds.

The lift/elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(150/1) = 12.25 seconds to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s.

The lift/elevator then travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for 150 meters - 5 m/s x 12.25 s = 50 meters.

The lift/elevator decelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(50/1) = 7.07 seconds to come to a stop.

Therefore, the total time it takes for the second person to get to 30/F is 12.25 s + 7.07 s = 19.32 seconds.

The total time it takes for both people to get to their respective floors is the maximum of the two times, which is 19.32 seconds.

3. The lift/elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(200/1) = 14.14 seconds to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s.

The lift/elevator then travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for 200 meters - 5 m/s x 14.14 s = 100 meters.

The lift/elevator decelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(100/1) = 10 seconds to come to a stop.

Therefore, the total time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F is 14.14 s + 10 s = 24.14 seconds.

To minimize the time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F, the second person should go to the floor that is closest to 40/F. The closest floor is 30/F, which is 100 meters away from the ground floor.

The lift/elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(100/1) = 10 seconds to reach its maximum speed of 5 m/s.

The lift/elevator then travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for 100 meters - 5 m/s x 10 s = 0 meters.

The lift/elevator decelerates at 1 m/s^2, so it takes sqrt(0/1) = 0 seconds to come to a stop.

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 10 s + 0 s = 10 seconds.
