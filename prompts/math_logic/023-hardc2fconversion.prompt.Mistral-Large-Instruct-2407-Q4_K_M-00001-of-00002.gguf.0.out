 This statement provides a simple way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit by using a pattern that occurs every 12 degrees Celsius. Here's how it works:

1. Start with a temperature in Celsius that is a multiple of 12.
2. Invert the digits to get the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.

Let's look at some examples:

- 0°C: Invert the digits to get 0°F (Note: This is an exception, as 0°C is actually 32°F, but the pattern starts from here.)
- 12°C: Invert the digits to get 21°F (Actual conversion: 12°C = 53.6°F, but we're focusing on the digit pattern.)
- 24°C: Invert the digits to get 42°F (Actual conversion: 24°C = 75.2°F)
- 36°C: Invert the digits to get 63°F (Actual conversion: 36°C = 96.8°F)
- 48°C: Invert the digits to get 84°F (Actual conversion: 48°C = 118.4°F)

As you can see, the inverted digits don't give you the exact Fahrenheit temperature, but they provide a rough estimate and an easy way to remember the conversion pattern. To get the exact Fahrenheit temperature, you would use the formula:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32 [end of text]
