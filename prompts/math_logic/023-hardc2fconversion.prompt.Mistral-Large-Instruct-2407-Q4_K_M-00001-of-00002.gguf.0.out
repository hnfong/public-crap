 This statement provides a simple way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit by using a pattern that occurs every 12 degrees Celsius. Let's break it down with examples:

1. Start with a temperature in Celsius that is a multiple of 12. For example, 12°C.
2. Convert it to Fahrenheit using the standard formula: `°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32`. So, `12°C = (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 53.6°F`.
3. Notice that the digits of the result (53) are the inversion of the starting Celsius temperature (35). This is the pattern referred to in the statement.

Let's try another example:

1. Start with 24°C.
2. Convert it to Fahrenheit: `24°C = (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 75.2°F`.
3. Again, notice that the digits of the result (75) are the inversion of the starting Celsius temperature (57).

This pattern continues for every multiple of 12°C:

- 36°C = 96.8°F (inverted digits: 69)
- 48°C = 118.4°F (inverted digits: 81)
- 60°C = 140°F (inverted digits: 04, or 40 when considering the tens and units digits)

So, the statement is a helpful trick to remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit for certain temperatures. However, it's important to note that this pattern only holds true for every 12°C and that the resulting Fahrenheit temperature is an approximation (since the actual conversion results in a decimal).
