Let's solve each question step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- Building has **40 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters tall**.
- The **lift starts at ground floor (1/F)** and goes to **top floor (40/F)**.
- **Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s²**
- **Maximum speed = 5 m/s**
- **Assumption**: The lift moves with constant acceleration until it reaches maximum speed, then moves at constant speed, and then decelerates to stop at the destination floor.

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

### **Step 1: Total height to travel**
- Total height = 40 floors × 5 m/floor = **200 meters**

### **Step 2: Motion profile**
- The lift starts from rest (0 m/s), accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches maximum speed (5 m/s), then moves at constant speed, and finally decelerates to stop at the top floor.

We can model this as a **piecewise motion**:

1. **Acceleration phase**: from 0 to 5 m/s
2. **Constant speed phase**: at 5 m/s
3. **Deceleration phase**: from 5 m/s to 0 m/s

We'll calculate the time for each phase and sum them.

---

### **Step 3: Acceleration phase**

- Acceleration: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Final velocity: $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $
- Time to reach max speed:
  $$
  t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

- Distance covered during acceleration:
  $$
  s_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 25 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Constant speed phase**

- Speed: $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $
- Time to travel remaining distance at constant speed:
  $$
  t_2 = \frac{200 - 12.5}{5} = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Deceleration phase**

- Final velocity: 0 m/s
- Acceleration: $ a = -1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Time to decelerate:
  $$
  t_3 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

- Distance covered during deceleration:
  $$
  s_3 = \frac{1}{2} a t_3^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-1) \cdot 5^2 = -12.5 \, \text{meters}
  $$

But we only care about the **total time**, not the distance.

---

### **Step 6: Total time**

$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 37.5 + 5 = \boxed{47.5 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

### **Step 1: Heights**
- 10/F = 10 × 5 = **50 meters**
- 30/F = 30 × 5 = **150 meters**

### **Step 2: Time to reach 10/F**
- As before, lift accelerates to 5 m/s, then moves at constant speed, then decelerates.

We already calculated:
- Acceleration phase: 5 sec
- Constant speed: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 m → 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 sec
- Deceleration phase: 5 sec

So total time to reach 10/F = **5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds**

---

### **Step 3: Time to reach 30/F**
- From 10/F to 30/F = 100 meters
- At constant speed: 100 / 5 = **20 seconds**

So total time to reach 30/F = **17.5 + 20 = 37.5 seconds**

---

### ✅ **Answer: 37.5 seconds**

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### **Step 1: Total height to 40/F = 200 meters**

We want to **minimize the time** to reach 40/F, **given that the lift must stop at one intermediate floor** (not 40/F).

Let’s assume the lift stops at floor **k**, where $ 1 < k < 40 $

Let’s define:

- $ h_k = k \times 5 = 5k $ meters
- Time to reach $ h_k $: $ t_k $
- Time to go from $ h_k $ to 200 m: $ t_{200 - h_k} $

We want to **minimize total time**:

$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_k + t_{200 - h_k}
$$

We already know:

- $ t_k = \text{time to reach } h_k $
- $ t_{200 - h_k} = \text{time to go from } h_k \text{ to } 200 \text{ m} $

Let’s define:

- $ t_k = t_{\text{accelerate to 5 m/s}} + t_{\text{constant speed}} + t_{\text{decelerate}} $

We already know:

- Acceleration phase: 5 sec
- Constant speed: $ \frac{5k - 12.5}{5} = \frac{5k - 12.5}{5} $
- Deceleration phase: 5 sec

So:

$$
t_k = 5 + \frac{5k - 12.5}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{5k - 12.5}{5}
$$

Similarly, for the second part:

- Constant speed: $ \frac{200 - 5k}{5} $
- Acceleration phase: 5 sec
- Deceleration phase: 5 sec

So:

$$
t_{200 - h_k} = 5 + \frac{200 - 5k}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{200 - 5k}{5}
$$

Now total time:

$$
t_{\text{total}} = 10 + \frac{5k - 12.5}{5} + 10 + \frac{200 - 5k}{5}
$$

Simplify:

$$
t_{\text{total}} = 20 + \frac{5k - 12.5 + 200 - 5k}{5} = 20 + \frac{187.5}{5} = 20 + 37.5 = \boxed{57.5 \, \text{seconds}}
$$
