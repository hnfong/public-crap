**Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.**  
Subtract 7 from both sides:  
3x = 15  
Divide by 3:  
x = 5  
The answer is **5**.

**Q7: What is 25% of 80?**  
25% of 80 is **20**.

**Q instruction: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the total amount I gave her?**  
You gave her:  
2 × $20 = $40  
Plus $5 = $45  
Total given: **$45**.  
But the question asks for the **final change** the shopkeeper should give you.  
You paid $45 for a $15 book, so the change is:  
$45 - $15 = **$30**.

**Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.**  
Perimeter = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = **20 units**.

**Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?**  
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = **4 children**.

**Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1**  
Following order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):  
12 ÷ 4 = 3  
Then: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5  
The answer is **5**.

**Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?**  
This is ambiguous. If we assume each guest (including Tom) gets one slice, then:  
Tom + 5 guests = 6 people → **6 slices**.  
But if only guests get cake, then **5 slices**.  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is **6 slices** (assuming Tom also eats cake).

**Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?**  
20% of $25 = $5  
Sale price = $25 - $5 = **$20**.

**Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?**  
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM:  
- From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours = 180 minutes  
- But we only go until 6:30, which is 15 minutes before 6:45  
So: 180 - 15 = **165 minutes**.

**Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?**  
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5 → Since you can't have half a taxi, you need **6 taxis**.

**Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?**  
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°  
Third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = **87°**.</think>Here are the answers to your questions:

3x = 15  
Divide by 3:  
x = 5  
The answer is **5**.

**Q7: What is 25% of 80?**  
25% of 80 is **20**.

**Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?**  
Total paid: (2 × $20) + $5 = $45  
Change: $45 - $15 = **$30**.

**Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.**  
Perimeter = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = **20 units**.

**Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?**  
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = **4 children**.

**Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1**  
Order of operations (division first):  
12 ÷ 4 = 3  
Then: 3 + 3 - 1 = **5**.

**Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is **6 slices** (assuming Tom and the 5 guests each get one slice).

**Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?**  
Discount: 20% of $25 = $5  
Sale price: $25 - $5 = **$20**.

**Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?**  
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM:  
- 3:45 to 6:45 = 3 hours (180 minutes)  
- Subtract 15 minutes (since 6:30 is 15 minutes before 6:45)  
Total: 180 - 15 = **165 minutes**.

**Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?**  
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5 → Round up to **6 taxis** (since partial taxis aren't allowed).

**Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?**  
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°  
Third angle: 180 - 31 - 62 = **87°**.
