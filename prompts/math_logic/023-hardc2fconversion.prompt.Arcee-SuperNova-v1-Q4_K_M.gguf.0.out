I think I see what's being claimed here, but I'm not sure it's entirely accurate. Let me break it down and provide examples to clarify.

The claim is that to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, every 12°C, the digits are inverted. This means that if you have a temperature in Celsius, you can add 12 to it, and the resulting Fahrenheit temperature will have its digits reversed.

Here are a few examples to test this claim:

1. 0°C + 12 = 12°C. The corresponding Fahrenheit temperature is 32°F. The digits are not exactly inverted, but rather, 32 is not a simple reversal of 12.
2. 12°C + 12 = 24°C. The corresponding Fahrenheit temperature is 75.2°F. Again, the digits are not inverted.
3. 24°C + 12 = 36°C. The corresponding Fahrenheit temperature is 96.8°F. No inversion here either.

It seems that the claim "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not a reliable method for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complex, and this rule of thumb doesn't hold up.

A more accurate way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to use the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.

If you have any further clarification or context about this claim, I'd be happy to revisit it. [end of text]
