Q8: The shopkeeper initially has two $20 bills, which is $40. She needs to give back $15 (the cost of the book). She gives an additional $5, so she has $45. She needs to give back $40 - $15 = $25. She has $45, so she gives back $45 - $25 = $20.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 2 brothers + 1 sister + 1 Katherine = 4 children.
Q11: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: If 5 guests have arrived, they need 5 slices of birthday cake.
Q13: The original price of the shirt is $25. A 20% discount means the discount amount is 0.20 * 25 = $5. The sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes. Adding the 45 minutes gives 165 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 165 minutes is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes. Subtracting the 45 minutes from 6:30 PM gives 3:45 PM + 2 hours and 45 minutes = 6:30 PM - 45 minutes = 6:15 PM. So, there are 45 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
Q15: To carry 22 people, with each taxi holding 4 passengers, we need 22 / 4 = 5.5 taxis. Since we can't have half a taxi, we need 6 taxis.
Q16: The sum of the two angles is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, the third angle is 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
