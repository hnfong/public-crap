### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

#### **Given:**
- Total height of the building = $40 \times 5 = 200 \, \text{m}$
- Acceleration = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$
- Deceleration = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$
- Maximum speed = $5 \, \text{m/s}$

#### **Steps:**

1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - The lift accelerates at $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ until it reaches its maximum speed of $5 \, \text{m/s}$.
   - Using the equation $v = u + at$, where $u = 0$, $v = 5$, and $a = 1$:
     $$
     5 = 0 + 1t \implies t = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
$$
   - Distance covered during acceleration:
     Using $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, where $u = 0$, $a = 1$, and $t = 5$:
     $$
     s = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(1)(5^2) = \frac{1}{2}(25) = 12.5 \, \text{m}.
$$

2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - The lift decelerates at $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ until it stops at the top floor.
   - The deceleration phase is symmetrical to the acceleration phase, so it also takes $5 \, \text{seconds}$ and covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$.

3. **Constant speed phase:**
   - The remaining distance is covered at the maximum speed of $5 \, \text{m/s}$.
   - Remaining distance:
     $$
     200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 \, \text{m}.
$$
   - Time to cover this distance at $5 \, \text{m/s}$:
     $$
     t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = $5 + 5 + 35 = 45 \, \text{seconds}$.

#### **Answer for Question 1:**
$$
\boxed{45 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

#### **Given:**
- Height of 10/F = $10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{m}$
- Height of 30/F = $30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m}$
- The lift must stop at both 10/F and 30/F.

#### **Steps:**

1. **First leg: Ground floor to 10/F:**
   - This is the same as Question 1, but the total height is now $50 \, \text{m}$.
   - Acceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Deceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Remaining distance: $50 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}$.
   - Time to cover this distance at $5 \, \text{m/s}$:
     $$
     t = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
$$
   - Total time for the first leg: $5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{seconds}$.

2. **Second leg: 10/F to 30/F:**
   - The lift starts at 10/F (50 m) and must reach 30/F (150 m).
   - Distance to cover: $150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
   - Acceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Deceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Remaining distance: $100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 \, \text{m}$.
   - Time to cover this distance at $5 \, \text{m/s}$:
     $$
     t = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{seconds}.
$$
   - Total time for the second leg: $5 + 5 + 15 = 25 \, \text{seconds}$.

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time = $15 + 25 = 40 \, \text{seconds}$.

#### **Answer for Question 2:**
$$
\boxed{40 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

#### **Given:**
- The lift must stop at one intermediate floor before reaching 40/F.
- The goal is to minimize the total time.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Key observation:**
   - To minimize the total time, the lift should stop at a floor such that the time spent accelerating, decelerating, and traveling at constant speed is minimized.
   - The optimal stopping point is halfway between the ground floor and the top floor, i.e., 20/F.

2. **First leg: Ground floor to 20/F:**
   - Height of 20/F = $20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
   - Acceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Deceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Remaining distance: $100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 \, \text{m}$.
   - Time to cover this distance at $5 \, \text{m/s}$:
     $$
     t = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{seconds}.
$$
   - Total time for the first leg: $5 + 5 + 15 = 25 \, \text{seconds}$.

3. **Second leg: 20/F to 40/F:**
   - The lift starts at 20/F (100 m) and must reach 40/F (200 m).
   - Distance to cover: $200 - 100 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
   - Acceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Deceleration phase: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ in $5 \, \text{seconds}$.
   - Remaining distance: $100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 \, \text{m}$.
   - Time to cover this distance at $5 \
