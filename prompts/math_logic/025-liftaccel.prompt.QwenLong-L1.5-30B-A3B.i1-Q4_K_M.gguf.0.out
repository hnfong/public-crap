Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. First, I need to remember how to calculate the time for an elevator that accelerates, moves at constant speed, and then decelerates. The key here is to figure out the distance covered during acceleration, the distance covered at constant speed, and the distance covered during deceleration. Since the elevator starts from rest and ends at rest (assuming it stops at the top floor), the acceleration and deceleration phases should be symmetric, right? Wait, but the problem says acceleration/deceleration is 1 m/s², so the magnitude is the same for both. So the time to accelerate to max speed should be the same as the time to decelerate from max speed to rest.

First, let's confirm the total height. The building has 40 stories, each 5 meters tall. So the total height from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F is 39 intervals, right? Wait, ground floor is 1/F, so to get to 40/F, you go up 39 floors. Wait, no: 1/F to 2/F is 5 meters, so 1/F to 40/F is 39*5 meters. Let me check that. If each floor is 5 meters tall, then the height from 1/F to 2/F is 5m, so from 1/F to n/F is (n-1)*5 meters. So 40/F is (40-1)*5 = 39*5 = 195 meters. Wait, but sometimes people might think 40 floors mean 40*5, but no, because the ground floor is 1/F, so the top floor is 40/F, so the number of intervals between floors is 39. So total distance is 39*5 = 195 meters. Let me confirm that. For example, 1/F to 2/F is 5m, so 1/F to 3/F is 10m, so yes, 1/F to n/F is (n-1)*5. So 40/F is 39*5 = 195 meters. Got that.

Now, the elevator has acceleration a = 1 m/s², maximum speed v_max = 5 m/s. So first, we need to find out if the elevator reaches its maximum speed during the trip. To do that, we can calculate the distance required to accelerate to v_max and then decelerate back to 0.

The time to accelerate to v_max is t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds. The distance covered during acceleration is s_acc = 0.5 * a * t_acc² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters. Similarly, the distance covered during deceleration is the same, s_dec = 12.5 meters. So total distance for acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. If the total distance (195 meters) is more than 25 meters, then the elevator will have a constant speed phase. Let's check: 195 > 25, so yes, there is a constant speed phase.

The distance covered at constant speed is total distance minus acceleration and deceleration distances: s_const = 195 - 25 = 170 meters. The time at constant speed is t_const = s_const / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds. Then total time is t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's verify the acceleration and deceleration distances again.

Acceleration phase: starting from 0, accelerating at 1 m/s² for 5 seconds, so final speed is 5 m/s. Distance is (v_initial + v_final)/2 * t = (0 + 5)/2 * 5 = 12.5 meters. Correct. Deceleration phase: same, from 5 m/s to 0, so distance is also 12.5 meters. So total for acceleration and deceleration is 25 meters. Total distance is 195, so 195 - 25 = 170 meters at 5 m/s, which takes 170 / 5 = 34 seconds. So total time is 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds. So question 1 should be 44 seconds. Wait, but let me check if the total distance is indeed 195. Wait, 40 stories, each 5 meters. Wait, sometimes the ground floor is considered 0, but the problem says ground floor is 1/F, so 1/F to 40/F is 39 floors up, so 39*5=195. That seems right.

Wait, but let me confirm with a smaller example. If it's a 2-story building, ground floor (1/F) to 2/F, that's 5 meters. So 1/F to 2/F is 5 meters. So 40/F is 39*5=195. Correct.

So question 1: 44 seconds. Let me note that down.

Now question 2: Two people get on the lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F, second to 30/F. How long does it take? Wait, the lift has to go to both floors, so it will go from 1/F to 10/F, then from 10/F to 30/F. Wait, but the problem says "how long does it take?" So the total time from ground floor to 30/F, since the second person is going to 30/F, so the lift has to stop at 10/F first, then go to 30/F. So we need to calculate the time for 1/F to 10/F, then 10/F to 30/F, and sum them up.

First, let's find the distance for 1/F to 10/F: that's (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45 meters.

Then, 10/F to 30/F: (30-10)*5 = 20*5 = 100 meters.

Now, for each segment, we need to calculate the time, considering acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.

First segment: 45 meters.

Check if the elevator reaches max speed. Acceleration distance: 12.5 meters, deceleration distance: 12.5 meters, total 25 meters. 45 meters is more than 25, so yes, it will have a constant speed phase.

So distance at constant speed: 45 - 25 = 20 meters. Time at constant speed: 20 / 5 = 4 seconds. Time for acceleration: 5 seconds, deceleration: 5 seconds. So total time for first segment: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 seconds.

Wait, but let's confirm. Acceleration phase: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds. Then constant speed: 20 meters at 5 m/s is 4 seconds. Then deceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds. Total 5+4+5=14 seconds. Correct.

Second segment: 10/F to 30/F, which is 100 meters.

Check if it reaches max speed. Acceleration and deceleration distance: 25 meters. 100 > 25, so yes.

Distance at constant speed: 100 - 25 = 75 meters. Time at constant speed: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds. So total time for second segment: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds.

Wait, but hold on: when the elevator is going from 10/F to 30/F, does it start from rest? Yes, because it stops at 10/F, so it has to accelerate from rest again. So the time for the second segment is indeed 25 seconds.

Therefore, total time is time for first segment plus time for second segment: 14 + 25 = 39 seconds.

Wait, but let me check if the distance for the second segment is correct. 10/F to 30/F is 20 floors, so 20*5=100 meters. Correct. So 100 meters. Acceleration and deceleration: 25 meters, so 75 meters at 5 m/s, which is 15 seconds. So 5+15+5=25. Correct. So total time 14+25=39 seconds. So question 2 is 39 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no overlap or something. The lift goes from 1/F to 10/F (14 seconds), stops, then goes from 10/F to 30/F (25 seconds), so total 39 seconds. That seems right.

Now question 3: Two people get on the lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Second person does not go to 40/F, so the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. We need to find the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F, considering it has to stop at another floor (so the second person gets off at some floor k/F, where k is between 2/F and 39/F, since it can't be 40/F). Wait, the problem says "the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor", so the second person gets off at some floor m/F where m ≠ 40, so m is from 1/F to 39/F. But since they get on at ground floor (1/F), the second person must get off at a floor above 1/F, so m is from 2/F to 39/F.

The lift has to go from 1/F to 40/F, but it must stop at m/F (the second person's floor) on the way. So the total trip is 1/F → m/F → 40/F. We need to find the value of m (between 2 and 39) that minimizes the total time for 1/F → m/F → 40/F.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the lift must stop at some floor other than 40/F, so the second person gets off at m/F, m ≠ 40, so m is 2 to 39. So we need to compute the total time for 1/F to m/F to 40/F, and find the m that minimizes this total time.

First, let's denote the distance from 1/F to m/F as d1 = (m - 1)*5 meters.

The distance from m/F to 40/F is d2 = (40 - m)*5 meters.

Total distance is d1 + d2 = 39*5 = 195 meters, which matches the first question.

Now, the total time is the time to go from 1/F to m/F plus the time to go from m/F to 40/F.

We need to compute T(m) = T1(m) + T2(m), where T1(m) is the time for 1/F to m/F, and T2(m) is the time for m/F to 40/F.

We need to find m (integer from 2 to 39) that minimizes T(m).

First, let's recall how to compute T(d) for a distance d: the time to travel distance d with acceleration a=1 m/s², max speed v=5 m/s.

As before, the critical distance is when the elevator can reach max speed. The distance needed to accelerate to max speed and decelerate is 2*(0.5*a*(v/a)²) = 2*(0.5*1*(5/1)²) = 2*(12.5) = 25 meters. So if d ≤ 25 meters, the elevator doesn't reach max speed; it accelerates for t1, then decelerates for t2, with t1 = t2, and total time 2*t1, where d = 0.5*a*t1² + 0.5*a*t2² = a*t1² (since t1 = t2). So d = a*t1², so t1 = sqrt(d/a), so total time T = 2*sqrt(d/a).

Wait, let's verify. If d ≤ 25 meters, then the elevator accelerates for t1, reaches some speed v1 < 5 m/s, then decelerates for t1 (since it has to stop at the destination), so total time 2*t1. The distance covered is s = 0.5*a*t1² + 0.5*a*t1² = a*t1². So t1 = sqrt(s/a), so total time T = 2*sqrt(s/a).

If d > 25 meters, then the elevator accelerates to 5 m/s (taking 5 seconds, 12.5 meters), then travels at 5 m/s for (d - 25) meters, then decelerates for 5 seconds (12.5 meters). So total time T = 5 + (d - 25)/5 + 5 = (d - 25)/5 + 10.

So for d ≤ 25, T = 2*sqrt(d/1) = 2*sqrt(d).

For d > 25, T = (d - 25)/5 + 10.

Wait, let's check with d=25: T = (25 - 25)/5 + 10 = 10 seconds. Alternatively, 2*sqrt(25) = 10 seconds. So that's consistent. Good.

So now, for T1(m), the distance d1 = (m - 1)*5. So d1 = 5(m - 1).

Similarly, d2 = (40 - m)*5 = 5(40 - m).

We need to compute T1(m) and T2(m) based on whether d1 and d2 are greater than 25 meters.

First, let's find the ranges for m where d1 ≤ 25 and d1 > 25.

d1 = 5(m - 1) ≤ 25 ⇒ m - 1 ≤ 5 ⇒ m ≤ 6. So for m ≤ 6, d1 ≤ 25, so T1(m) = 2*sqrt(d1) = 2*sqrt(5(m - 1)).

For m ≥ 7, d1 > 25, so T1(m) = (d1 - 25)/5 + 10 = (5(m - 1) - 25)/5 + 10 = (5m - 5 - 25)/5 + 10 = (5m - 30)/5 + 10 = (m - 6) + 10 = m + 4.

Wait, let's check that algebra:

(d1 - 25)/5 + 10 = (5(m - 1) - 25)/5 + 10 = (5m - 5 - 25)/5 + 10 = (5m - 30)/5 + 10 = m - 6 + 10 = m + 4. Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for d2 = 5(40 - m).

d2 ≤ 25 ⇒ 5(40 - m) ≤ 25 ⇒ 40 - m ≤ 5 ⇒ m ≥ 35. So for m ≥ 35, d2 ≤ 25, so T2(m) = 2*sqrt(d2) = 2*sqrt(5(40 - m)).

For m ≤ 34, d2 > 25, so T2(m) = (d2 - 25)/5 + 10 = (5(40 - m) - 25)/5 + 10 = (200 - 5m - 25)/5 + 10 = (175 - 5m)/5 + 10 = 35 - m + 10 = 45 - m.

Wait, let's verify:

(5(40 - m) - 25)/5 + 10 = (200 - 5m - 25)/5 + 10 = (175 - 5m)/5 + 10 = 35 - m + 10 = 45 - m. Correct.

So now, we can break down T(m) into different cases based on m.

Case 1: m ≤ 6 (so d1 ≤ 25, and d2 = 5(40 - m) ≥ 5(40 - 6) = 5*34 = 170 > 25, so T2(m) = 45 - m).

Thus, T(m) = 2*sqrt(5(m - 1)) + (45 - m).

Case 2: 7 ≤ m ≤ 34 (so d1 > 25, d2 > 25).

Thus, T(m) = (m + 4) + (45 - m) = 49 seconds. Wait, that's interesting. Let's check: T1(m) = m + 4, T2(m) = 45 - m, so T(m) = (m + 4) + (45 - m) = 49. So for all m from 7 to 34, the total time is 49 seconds.

Case 3: m ≥ 35 (so d1 = 5(m - 1) ≥ 5(35 - 1) = 5*34 = 170 > 25, so T1(m) = m + 4; d2 ≤ 25, so T2(m) = 2*sqrt(5(40 - m))).

Thus, T(m) = (m + 4) + 2*sqrt(5(40 - m)).

Now, we need to check if there's a minimum in Case 1 or Case 3, because in Case 2, the time is constant 49 seconds. So we need to see if Case 1 or Case 3 has a time less than 49.

First, let's check Case 1: m ≤ 6. Let's compute T(m) for m=2,3,4,5,6.

m=2: d1=5(2-1)=5 meters. T1=2*sqrt(5*1)=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 seconds. d2=5(40-2)=190 meters. T2=45 - 2=43 seconds. Total T≈4.472 + 43≈47.472 seconds.

Wait, but hold on: d2=190 meters, which is greater than 25, so T2=45 - m=45 - 2=43. Correct. So total≈47.472.

m=3: d1=5(3-1)=10 meters. T1=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324 seconds. T2=45 - 3=42. Total≈6.324 + 42≈48.324.

m=4: d1=15 meters. T1=2*sqrt(15)≈7.746. T2=45 - 4=41. Total≈7.746 + 41≈48.746.

m=5: d1=20 meters. T1=2*sqrt(20)=2*4.472≈8.944. T2=45 - 5=40. Total≈8.944 + 40≈48.944.

m=6: d1=25 meters. T1=2*sqrt(25)=10 seconds. T2=45 - 6=39. Total=10 + 39=49 seconds.

Wait, so for m=2, T≈47.472; m=3,≈48.324; m=4,≈48.746; m=5,≈48.944; m=6,49.

Now, Case 3: m ≥35. Let's check m=35,36,37,38,39.

m=35: d1=5(35-1)=170 meters. T1=35 + 4=39 seconds. d2=5(40-35)=25 meters. T2=2*sqrt(25)=10 seconds. Total=39 + 10=49 seconds.

m=36: d1=5(36-1)=175 meters. T1=36 + 4=40 seconds. d2=5(40-36)=20 meters. T2=2*sqrt(20)≈8.944. Total≈40 + 8.944≈48.944.

m=37: d1=5(37-1)=180 meters. T1=37 + 4=41 seconds. d2=5(40-37)=15 meters. T2=2*sqrt(15)≈7.746. Total≈41 + 7.746≈48.746.

m=38: d1=5(38-1)=185 meters. T1=38 + 4=42 seconds. d2=5(40-38)=10 meters. T2=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324. Total≈42 + 6.324≈48.324.

m=39: d1=5(39-1)=190 meters. T1=39 + 4=43 seconds. d2=5(40-39)=5 meters. T2=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472. Total≈43 + 4.472≈47.472.

So in Case 3, m=39 gives T≈47.472, same as m=2 in Case 1.

Wait, so the minimum time in Case 1 and Case 3 is approximately 47.472 seconds, achieved at m=2 and m=39.

But wait, the problem says "the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor", so m can be 2 to 39. So m=2 and m=39 are both valid (since 2/F and 39/F are between 1/F and 40/F).

But let's confirm if these are indeed the minima.

In Case 1, as m increases from 2 to 6, T(m) increases from ~47.472 to 49.

In Case 3, as m decreases from 39 to 35, T(m) decreases from ~47.472 to 49.

Wait, for m=39, T≈47.472; m=38,≈48.324; m=37,≈48.746; m=36,≈48.944; m=35,49. So yes, the minimum in Case 3 is at m=39.

Similarly, in Case 1, the minimum is at m=2.

So the minimum time is approximately 47.472 seconds. But we need to check if this is exact.

Wait, for m=2: d1=5 meters. T1=2*sqrt(5*1)=2*sqrt(5). d2=190 meters. T2=45 - 2=43. So total T=2*sqrt(5) + 43.

Similarly, for m=39: d1=190 meters, T1=39 + 4=43. d2=5 meters, T2=2*sqrt(5). So total T=43 + 2*sqrt(5), same as m=2.

Now, 2*sqrt(5) is approximately 4.472135955, so total time≈43 + 4.472135955≈47.472135955 seconds.

But the problem says "what is the minimum time", so we need to present the exact value or the approximate? The problem says "answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps." So probably we need to give the exact value, but maybe they want a decimal. Let's check.

Wait, but let's confirm if the calculation for T1 when d1=5 meters is correct. For d=5 meters, which is less than 25 meters, so the elevator accelerates and then decelerates. The time to accelerate to some speed v, then decelerate to 0. The distance is 5 meters. So s = 0.5*a*t1² + 0.5*a*t2². Since it's symmetric, t1 = t2 = t. So s = a*t². So 5 = 1*t² ⇒ t = sqrt(5). So total time is 2*t = 2*sqrt(5). Correct. So T1=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 seconds.

Then, for d2=190 meters, which is greater than 25, so T2=(190 - 25)/5 + 10 = 165/5 + 10 = 33 + 10 = 43 seconds. Correct. So total time=2*sqrt(5) + 43≈47.472 seconds.

Similarly, for m=39, T1=43 seconds (since d1=190 meters, T1=190/5 - 5 + 5? Wait, no, earlier we had T1(m)=m + 4 when m ≥7. For m=39, T1=39 + 4=43. Let's verify: d1=190 meters. Acceleration distance 12.5, deceleration 12.5, so constant speed distance=190 - 25=165 meters. Time at constant speed=165/5=33 seconds. Total time=5 + 33 + 5=43 seconds. Correct. Then d2=5 meters, T2=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472. So total time=43 + 2*sqrt(5)≈47.472.

Now, is there a possibility of a lower time? Let's check if m=1 is allowed, but m=1 is the ground floor, but the second person gets on at ground floor, so they can't get off at ground floor (since they're already there). So m must be at least 2. Similarly, m=40 is not allowed, so m=39 is the highest possible.

Wait, but the problem says "the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor", so m can be 2 to 39, which we considered.

Now, is there a case where the elevator doesn't reach max speed in both segments, but maybe the total time is less? Wait, but in Case 1, when m=2, the first segment is 5 meters (no max speed), and the second segment is 190 meters (reaches max speed). In Case 3, the first segment is 190 meters (reaches max speed), and the second segment is 5 meters (no max speed). So those are the two extremes.

Wait, but let's check if there's a value of m where both segments are less than 25 meters. But d1 + d2=195 meters, so if both d1 ≤25 and d2 ≤25, then d1 + d2 ≤50, but 195 >50, so that's impossible. So at least one of the segments must be greater than 25 meters. In fact, since 195 >50, both segments can't be ≤25. So the only possibilities are:

- d1 ≤25 and d2 >25 (Case 1)

- d1 >25 and d2 ≤25 (Case 3)

- d1 >25 and d2 >25 (Case 2)

In Case 2, the total time is 49 seconds, which is higher than the Case 1 and Case 3 minima.

So the minimum time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds, which is approximately 47.472 seconds.

But let's confirm with m=2:

1/F to 2/F: 5 meters. Time: 2*sqrt(5) ≈4.472 seconds.

2/F to 40/F: 38 floors, so 38*5=190 meters. Time: (190 -25)/5 +10=165/5 +10=33 +10=43 seconds.

Total: 4.472 +43=47.472 seconds.

Similarly, m=39:

1/F to 39/F: 38 floors, 190 meters. Time:43 seconds.

39/F to 40/F:5 meters. Time:2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 seconds.

Total:43 +4.472=47.472 seconds.

So that's correct.

Now, the problem says "the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the minimum time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds. But let's see if we need to write it as a decimal or exact value. The problem says "answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps." So probably we can present the exact value, but maybe they want a numerical value. Let's check the problem statement. It doesn't specify, but in math problems like this, sometimes exact form is preferred, but sometimes they want a decimal. Let's see.

Wait, but let's check if 2*sqrt(5) is the exact value. Yes, because for the 5-meter segment, the time is 2*sqrt(5) seconds. So the total time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds. Let's compute that numerically: sqrt(5)≈2.23607, so 2*sqrt(5)≈4.47214, so total≈47.47214 seconds.

But let's confirm if there's a mistake in assuming that for d2=190 meters, T2=43 seconds. Let's recalculate T2 for d2=190 meters.

d2=190 meters. Acceleration: 12.5 meters, 5 seconds. Deceleration:12.5 meters, 5 seconds. Constant speed:190 -25=165 meters. Time at constant speed:165/5=33 seconds. Total time:5+33+5=43 seconds. Correct.

Similarly, for d1=5 meters: acceleration and deceleration. Distance=5 meters. So 0.5*a*t² +0.5*a*t²= a*t²=5 ⇒ t²=5 ⇒ t=sqrt(5). Total time=2*sqrt(5). Correct.

So the minimum time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds, approximately 47.47 seconds.

Wait, but let's check if m=2 is allowed. The second person gets on at ground floor (1/F) and gets off at 2/F. That's a valid stop. Similarly, m=39 is valid (gets off at 39/F). So both are acceptable.

Is there a possibility of a lower time with a different m? Let's check m=2.5, but m has to be an integer floor, right? The problem says "another floor between 1/F and 40/F", so floors are integer, so m must be integer. So m=2 and m=39 are the only ones that give the minimum.

Wait, but let's check m=2: 2/F is the second floor, which is between 1/F and 40/F, so it's valid. Similarly, 39/F is valid.

So the minimum time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds, which is approximately 47.47 seconds.

Wait, but let's make sure we didn't make a mistake in the Case 2. For m=7 to 34, T(m)=49 seconds. Let's check m=7.

m=7: d1=5*(7-1)=30 meters. T1=(30 -25)/5 +10=5/5 +10=1 +10=11 seconds. Wait, earlier we had T1(m)=m +4. For m=7, 7 +4=11. Correct. d2=5*(40-7)=5*33=165 meters. T2=(165 -25)/5 +10=140/5 +10=28 +10=38 seconds. 45 - m=45 -7=38. Correct. So T(m)=11 +38=49 seconds. Correct.

m=34: d1=5*(34-1)=165 meters. T1=34 +4=38 seconds. d2=5*(40-34)=30 meters. T2=45 -34=11 seconds. Total=38 +11=49 seconds. Correct.

So Case 2 is indeed 49 seconds, which is higher than the Case 1 and 3 minima.

Therefore, the minimum time is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds, approximately 47.47 seconds.

Wait, but let's check if the problem says "the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the lift must stop at another floor, so it can't go directly from 1/F to 40/F (which would be 44 seconds, as in question 1). So the minimum time with a stop is approximately 47.47 seconds, which is longer than 44 seconds, which makes sense because stopping adds time.

Wait, but in question 1, the time is 44 seconds (no stops), and with a stop, it's longer, which matches. So 47.47 is longer than 44, which is correct.

Wait, but let's confirm question 1 again. Total distance 195 meters. Acceleration:12.5, deceleration:12.5, constant speed:170. Time:5 + 34 +5=44. Correct. So 44 seconds.

So question 3's minimum time is approximately 47.47 seconds.

Now, let's summarize:

1. 44 seconds.

2. 39 seconds.

3. 43 + 2√5 seconds (≈47.47 seconds).

Wait, but let's check question 2 again. The first person goes to 10/F, second to 30/F. So the lift goes 1/F to 10/F (45 meters), then 10/F to 30/F (100 meters).

For 1/F to 10/F: 45 meters. Acceleration and deceleration:25 meters, so constant speed:20 meters. Time:5 + 4 +5=14 seconds. Correct.

10/F to 30/F:100 meters. Acceleration and deceleration:25 meters, constant speed:75 meters. Time:5 +15 +5=25 seconds. Total:14 +25=39 seconds. Correct.

Yes, that's right.

So the answers are:

1. 44 seconds.

2. 39 seconds.

3. 43 + 2√5 seconds (or approximately 47.47 seconds).

But let's make sure the problem says "the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F". So the lift must stop at another floor, so the minimum time is indeed the one we calculated.

Wait, but is there a case where the elevator doesn't stop at the intermediate floor, but the problem says "it has to stop at another floor", so it must stop, so we can't have the direct trip. So the minimum time with a stop is 43 + 2√5.

I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Question 1: Total distance 195 meters. Acceleration/deceleration 25 meters, constant speed 170 meters. Time:5+34+5=44. Correct.

Question 2: Two stops: 45 meters (14s) and 100 meters (25s). Total 39s. Correct.

Question 3: Minimum time with a stop is when the stop is at the very first or very last possible floor (2/F or 39/F), giving total time 43 + 2√5 ≈47.47s.

Yes, that seems right.

### **Question 1: Time to travel from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

**Total Distance:**  
The building has 40 stories, with each floor being 5 meters tall. The distance from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) is:  
$$
(40 - 1) \times 5 = 39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
$$

**Acceleration and Deceleration Phases:**  
- Acceleration/deceleration rate: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $  
- Maximum speed: $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $  
- Time to accelerate to max speed:  
  $$
  t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
  $$  
- Distance covered during acceleration:  
  $$
  s_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}
  $$  
- Similarly, distance during deceleration: $ s_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $  
- Total distance for acceleration and deceleration:  
  $$
  s_{\text{acc}} + s_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}
  $$

**Constant Speed Phase:**  
- Remaining distance:
