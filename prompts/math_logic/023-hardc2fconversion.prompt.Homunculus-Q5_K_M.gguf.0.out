Let's break this down and explain it clearly.

### **The Statement:**
> "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This is a **memory trick** to help you convert **Celsius to Fahrenheit** more easily.

---

### **What does "digits are inverted" mean?**

Inverting digits means **swapping the tens and units digits** of a number.

For example:
- If you have the number **12**, and you invert the digits, you get **21**.
- If you have the number **34**, and you invert the digits, you get **43**.

---

### **What does "every 12°C" mean?**

This is the key part of the trick. It means that **every time the Celsius temperature increases by 12°C**, the **Fahrenheit temperature increases by 18°F** (because 12°C × 1.8 = 21.6°F, but we're rounding to 18°F for simplicity).

So, **every 12°C**, the **digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted**.

---

### **How to Use the Trick:**

Let’s walk through an example.

#### **Example 1: 24°C to Fahrenheit**

1. **Start with 24°C.**
2. **Multiply by 1.8:**  
   $ 24 \times 1.8 = 43.2°F $
3. **Now, apply the trick:**  
   Since 24 is a multiple of 12 (24 ÷ 12 = 2), we invert the digits of the Fahrenheit result:  
   $ 43.2°F \rightarrow 34.2°F $

✅ **Final Answer:** **34.2°F**

---

#### **Example 2: 36°C to Fahrenheit**

1. **Start with 36°C.**
2. **Multiply by 1.8:**  
   $ 36 \times 1.8 = 64.8°F $
3. **Apply the trick:**  
   Since 36 is a multiple of 12 (36 ÷ 12 = 3), invert the digits:  
   $ 64.8°F \rightarrow 46.8°F $

✅ **Final Answer:** **46.8°F**

---

### **Why This Works:**

The trick is based on the fact that:

- **12°C × 1.8 = 21.6°F**
- So, **every 12°C increase in Celsius** corresponds to **a 21.6°F increase in Fahrenheit**.
- But since we're dealing with whole numbers, we **round 21.6 to 18°F** for simplicity.
- So, **every 12°C**, the **Fahrenheit temperature increases by 18°F**, and the **digits are inverted**.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Every 12°C**, the **Fahrenheit temperature increases by 18°F**.
- **At the same time**, the **digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted**.
- This helps you **remember** the conversion without doing the full math.

### **Another Example: 48°C to Fahrenheit**

1. **Start with 48°C.**
2. **Multiply by 1.8:**  
   $ 48 \times 1.8 = 86.4°F $
3. **Apply the trick:**  
   Since 48 is a multiple of 12 (48 ÷ 12 = 4), invert the digits:  
   $ 86.4°F \rightarrow 68.4°F $

✅ **Final Answer:** **68.4°F**

---

### **Final Tip:**

This trick works **only for whole numbers** (like 12, 24, 36, 48, etc.).  
For non-multiples of 12, you can still use the trick **by rounding** or **using the full formula**:

$$
°F = (°C \times 1.8) + 32
$$
