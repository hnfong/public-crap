First, I'll address each question one by one, starting with the significance of the number 120 and its interesting properties.

Next, I'll move on to solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) by factoring or using the quadratic formula if necessary.

Finally, I'll tackle the train problem by calculating the total time available in a day, determining the time per round trip, and then finding out how many round trips the train can complete within that time.

**Question 1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 holds several interesting properties and significance across various fields:

1. **Mathematics:**
   - **Factorial:** 120 is the factorial of 5, denoted as \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
   - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 has 30 divisors, making it a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller number.
   - **Divisibility:** 120 is divisible by many numbers, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

2. **Science:**
   - **Temperature:** 120 degrees Fahrenheit is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi).
   - **Chemistry:** The element with atomic number 120 is currently unnamed and is referred to as Unbinilium (Ubh).

3. **Everyday Life:**
   - **Electrical Systems:** In the United States, 120 volts is the standard voltage for household electrical outlets.
   - **Military:** The M120 is a U.S. Army mortar system.

4. **Religion and History:**
   - **Bible:** Some interpretations suggest that the number 120 represents a period of divine patience before judgment.
   - **Ancient Civilizations:** The ancient Sumerians used a base-60 number system, and 120 is 2 times 60, which was significant in their mathematics and timekeeping.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is significant in mathematics as \(5!\), a highly composite number, and in various fields like science, everyday applications, and historical contexts.

**Question 2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)**

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Here, we'll use factoring.

1. **Factoring:**
   We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-18\) and add up to \(-7\).
   - The numbers \(-9\) and \(2\) satisfy this because:
     \[
     (-9) \times 2 = -18 \quad \text{and} \quad (-9) + 2 = -7
     \]
   - Therefore, the equation factors as:
     \[
     (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
     \]

2. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   x - 9 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 9
   \]
   \[
   x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
   \]

**Answer:**
The solutions are \(\boxed{9}\) and \(\boxed{-2}\).

**Question 3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   - Distance for one round trip: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\)
   - Time for one round trip:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.6667 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Total time available in a day:**
   - 24 hours.

3. **Number of round trips:**
   \[
   \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours per round trip}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]
   Since the train cannot complete 0.6 of a round trip, we take the integer part.

**Answer:**
The train can make \(\boxed{3}\) full round trips in a day. [end of text]
