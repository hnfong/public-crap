There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?
 1. To calculate the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration, deceleration, and constant speed phases of the journey.

   - The total height to be covered is \( 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \).

   - The lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s and then decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration can be calculated using the formula for distance under constant acceleration:
     \[
     d = \frac{v^2}{2a}
     \]
     where \( v = 5 \text{ m/s} \) and \( a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \).

     \[
     d = \frac{5^2}{2 \times 1} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - The total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is \( 2 \times 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).

   - The remaining distance covered at constant speed is:
     \[
     200 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - The time taken to cover the distance at constant speed is:
     \[
     t_{\text{constant}} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The time taken to accelerate and decelerate is:
     \[
     t_{\text{acc/dec}} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The total time taken is:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = 2 \times 5 \text{ seconds} + 35 \text{ seconds} = 45 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   Therefore, it takes 45 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. For the second question, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the 10th floor and then to the 30th floor.

   - The lift first goes to the 10th floor, which is \( 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \).

   - The lift accelerates to 5 m/s and then decelerates to 0 m/s. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is \( 2 \times 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).

   - The remaining distance covered at constant speed is:
     \[
     50 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - The time taken to cover the distance at constant speed is:
     \[
     t_{\text{constant}} = \frac{25 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The time taken to accelerate and decelerate is:
     \[
     t_{\text{acc/dec}} = 2 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 10 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The total time to reach the 10th floor is:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = 10 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - Next, the lift goes from the 10th floor to the 30th floor, which is \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \).

   - The lift accelerates to 5 m/s and then decelerates to 0 m/s. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is \( 2 \times 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).

   - The remaining distance covered at constant speed is:
     \[
     100 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 75 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - The time taken to cover the distance at constant speed is:
     \[
     t_{\text{constant}} = \frac{75 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 15 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The time taken to accelerate and decelerate is:
     \[
     t_{\text{acc/dec}} = 2 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 10 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The total time to reach the 30th floor from the 10th floor is:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = 10 \text{ seconds} + 15 \text{ seconds} = 25 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The total time for the entire journey is:
     \[
     15 \text{ seconds} + 25 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   Therefore, it takes 40 seconds for the lift to go from the ground floor to the 10th floor and then to the 30th floor.

3. For the third question, we need to find the minimum time it takes for the lift to get to the 40th floor if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F.

   - The lift must stop at another floor, so let's consider the optimal stopping floor that minimizes the total time. The optimal stopping floor would be the one that minimizes the additional distance covered.

   - If the lift stops at the 20th floor, it will cover \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \) to the 20th floor and then \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \) to the 40th floor.

   - The lift accelerates to 5 m/s and then decelerates to 0 m/s. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is \( 2 \times 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).

   - The remaining distance covered at constant speed to the 20th floor is:
     \[
     100 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 75 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - The time taken to cover the distance at constant speed is:
     \[
     t_{\text{constant}} = \frac{75 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 15 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The time taken to accelerate and decelerate is:
     \[
     t_{\text{acc/dec}} = 2 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 10 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The total time to reach the 20th floor is:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = 10 \text{ seconds} + 15 \text{ seconds} = 25 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - The lift then goes from the 20th floor to the 40th floor, which is \( 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \).

   - The lift accelerates to 5 m/s and then decelerates to 0 m/s. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is \( 2 \times 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).

   - The remaining distance covered at constant speed is:
     \[
     100 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{
