Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 / 1) = 24
Double checking: (8 * 3) - (4 / 1) = 24 - 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 8) - (3 - 1) = 32 - 2 = 30, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: (8 * 3) + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 3) + (8 - 1) = 12 + 7 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 - 1) = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (3 + 8) - 1 = 4 * 11 - 1 = 44 - 1 = 43, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (3 * 8) / 1 = 4 * 24 / 1 = 96, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 3) + (8 - 1) = 12 + 7 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
 Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 - 1 * 1) = 24 - (4 - 1) = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
 Attempt: (4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 4 * 4 + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24
 Double checking: (4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8), which is correct.
```

The correct mathematical expression is `(4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 24`.
