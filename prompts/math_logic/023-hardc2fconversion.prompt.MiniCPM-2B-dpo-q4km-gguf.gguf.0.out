"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

<AI> This is a mnemonic device or a memory aid used to remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The mnemonic "Celsius to Fahrenheit" is an example of a mnemonic device that helps people remember the formula:

Celsius to Fahrenheit:

F = (C * 1.8) + 32

In this mnemonic, "Celsius" represents "Celsius," "to" represents the conversion operator (to), "Fahrenheit" represents "Fahrenheit" (a German word for the same, but the spelling is different), and the parentheses and numbers are used to create a catchy and memorable phrase:

Every 12°C (Celsius) is equivalent to 54°F (Fahrenheit).

This mnemonic device helps you recall the conversion by associating the Celsius and Fahrenheit symbols with the numbers 12 and 54, respectively, in the phrase "Celsius to Fahrenheit." By remembering this phrase, it becomes easier to recall the formula (F = (C * 1.8) + 32), and you can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit quickly without having to look up the conversion factor each time.

For example, if you want to convert 20°C to Fahrenheit, you would use the mnemonic "Celsius to Fahrenheit":

F = (20 * 1.8) + 32
F = 36 + 32
F = 68°F

So, 20°C is equivalent to 68°F.
