The phrase "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help people remember how to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It suggests that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the temperature in Fahrenheit are reversed.

Let's break this down with an example:

1. Start with a temperature in Celsius, say 12°C.
2. According to the mnemonic, you invert the digits of the Celsius temperature to get the Fahrenheit temperature.
3. Inverting the digits of 12 gives you 21.

Now, let's verify this with the actual conversion formula:
- The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
- Plugging in 12°C: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6 \)

So, 12°C is approximately 53.6°F, and when you invert the digits of 12, you get 21, which is close to 53.6. This mnemonic works well for small increments of 12°C, but it becomes less accurate as the Celsius temperature increases.

For example:
- 24°C (inverting digits gives 42)
  - Actual conversion: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2 \)
  - Inverted digits: 42 (which is close to 75.2)

- 36°C (inverting digits gives 63)
  - Actual conversion: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8 \)
  - Inverted digits: 63 (which is close to 96.8)

While this mnemonic is a fun and simple way to remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit, it is not perfectly accurate for all temperatures. For precise conversions, it's best to use the formula or a calculator. [end of text]
