Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), but the input set is (4, 3, 1, 8). I used '4' twice and missed '1'. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) * 1 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 1, 1). I used '1' twice and missed '3'. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) was 16. Let's try division. 8 / (1 - 3/4)? No, fractions might be messy. Let's try simple multiplication.
Attempt: 8 * 3 * (4 - 3)? No, need to use 1.
Attempt: 8 * 3 * 1 * (4/4)? No, need to use specific numbers.
Let's re-evaluate: 8, 4, 3, 1.
How about $8 \times 3 \times (4 - 3)$? That uses 8, 3, 4, 3. Incorrect.
How about $(8 - 4) \times (3 + 1)$? That is $4 \times 4 = 16$.
How about $8 \times (4 - 1) \times 1$? Uses 8, 4, 1, 1. Missing 3.
How about $8 \times 3 \times 1 \times (4-3)$? Uses 8, 3, 1, 4, 3. Too many numbers.
Let's try: $8 \times (4 - 1) = 24$. Then multiply by something that equals 1 using the remaining number 3? No, I have used 8, 4, 1. Remaining is 3. I need to incorporate 3 to make 1? No, I need to use all numbers exactly once.
Numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8.
Try: $8 \times 3 \times (4 - 3)$? No, that uses 3 twice.
Try: $8 \times 3 \times 1^{(4)}$? No exponentiation usually allowed unless specified, and $1^4=1$. $8 \times 3 \times 1 = 24$. But I haven't used 4.
Wait, $8 \times 3 = 24$. I have 4 and 1 left. Can I make 1 from 4 and 1? No, $4-1=3$, $4/1=4$, $4+1=5$.
Can I make 0 from 4 and 1 to add? No.
Maybe the structure is different.
$(8 - 4) \times (3 + 1) = 16$.
$(8 + 4) \times (3 - 1) = 12 \times 2 = 24$.
Let's check the numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1.
Expression: $(8 + 4) \times (3 - 1)$.
Calculation: $8 + 4 = 12$. $3 - 1 = 2$. $12 \times 2 = 24$.
Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1. All present exactly once.

Double checking: $(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). This matches the input set (4, 3, 1, 8). Success.

Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect (used 4 twice, missed 1). Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 * 1 + (4 - 4)? No, only one 4. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). The set matches the input (4, 3, 1, 8). Correct.
