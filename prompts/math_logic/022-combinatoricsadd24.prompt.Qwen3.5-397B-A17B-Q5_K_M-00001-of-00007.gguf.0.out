Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect (used 4 twice, missed 1). Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) was 16. Let's try division. 8 / (1 - 3/4)? No, fractions might be messy. Let's try simple multiplication.
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) * 1? No, need to use 3.
Attempt: 8 * 3 * (4 - 3)? No, need to use 1.
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 16.
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24.
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1. All numbers from (4, 3, 1, 8) are used exactly once. The result is 24.

Final Answer: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24 [end of text]
