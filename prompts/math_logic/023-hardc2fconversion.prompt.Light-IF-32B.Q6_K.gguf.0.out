Got it, let's tackle this question. First, I need to understand what the statement means: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted." Then, I need to explain it with examples and make sure I'm not making mistakes.

First, let's recall the standard formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit:  
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.  

The statement is saying there's a shortcut or pattern where, for every 12°C, the digits of the Celsius and Fahrenheit values are "inverted" (i.e., swapped). So, if Celsius is a two-digit number, Fahrenheit would be the same digits but reversed.  

Let's test this with examples to see if it works.  

**Example 1: 12°C**  
Using the formula:  
°F = (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F.  
Wait, 12°C converts to 53.6°F. The digits of 12 are 1 and 2, and the Fahrenheit is 53.6. That's not an inversion. So maybe I misunderstood the "every 12°C" part.  

Wait, maybe the statement means that for certain Celsius values (not necessarily every 12°C, but at intervals of 12°C), the Fahrenheit value has inverted digits. Let's try another example.  

**Example 2: 21°C**  
°F = (21 × 9/5) + 32 = 37.8 + 32 = 69.8°F.  
21°C converts to 69.8°F. The digits of 21 are 2 and 1, and the Fahrenheit is 69.8. That's not an inversion.  

Wait, maybe the statement is referring to specific Celsius values where the Fahrenheit is the reverse of the Celsius digits. Let's think of numbers where Celsius and Fahrenheit are two-digit numbers with reversed digits.  

For example:  
- 12°C → 53.6°F (no)  
- 21°C → 69.8°F (no)  
- 13°C → 55.4°F (no)  
- 31°C → 87.8°F (31 and 87.8: 31 reversed is 13, not 87.8)  

Hmm, maybe I need to find a Celsius value where the Fahrenheit is the reverse of the Celsius digits. Let's try:  

Let’s say Celsius is "ab" (two digits: 10a + b). Then Fahrenheit should be "ba" (10b + a).  

Using the formula:  
10b + a = (10a + b) × 9/5 + 32.  

Let’s solve this equation for integers a and b (digits 0-9).  

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:  
5(10b + a) = 9(10a + b) + 160  
50b + 5a = 90a + 9b + 160  
50b - 9b + 5a - 90a = 160  
41b - 85a = 160  

Now, we need to find integers a and b (0-9) that satisfy this equation.  

Let’s rearrange:  
41b = 85a + 160  
b = (85a + 160)/41  

Try a = 1:  
b = (85 + 160)/41 = 245/41 ≈ 5.975 → Not an integer.  

a = 2:  
b = (170 + 160)/41 = 330/41 ≈ 8.048 → Close to 8.  

Check if 8 is an integer: 330 ÷ 41 = 8.048... No.  

a = 3:  
b = (255 + 160)/41 = 415/41 = 10.12 → Too big (b must be ≤9).  

a = 0:  
b = (0 + 160)/41 ≈ 3.9 → Not integer.  

Wait, maybe there's no such integer solution? That would mean the statement is not accurate, or maybe it's referring to approximate values or specific examples.  

Wait, let's go back to the original statement: "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." Maybe it's not about exact inversion, but about a pattern where adding 12°C leads to a Fahrenheit value with digits swapped?  

For example:  

Let’s say 12°C → 53.6°F. If we add 12°C to 12°C, we get 24°C.  

24°C → (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F.  

Wait, 24°C → 75.2°F. The digits of 24 are 2 and 4, and 75.2 is close to 75. That's not an inversion.  

Another example: 36°C → (36 × 9/5) + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8°F.  

36°C → 96.8°F. The digits of 36 are 3 and 6, and 96.8 is close to 96. That's an inversion! 36 reversed is 63, but 96 is not 63. Wait, no.  

Wait, but maybe the statement is referring to approximate values or specific cases where the digits are swapped. For example:  

Let’s try 12°C → 53.6°F. If we round to the nearest whole number: 54°F. 12 and 54: no.  

21°C → 69.8°F → 70°F. 21 and 70: no.  

But wait, let's think of 13°C → 55.4°F → 55°F. 13 and 55: no.  

Wait, maybe the statement is a mnemonic, not an exact rule. For example, if you remember that 12°C is about 54°F, and then every 12°C added, you add 21.6°F (since 12°C × 9/5 = 21.6°F). So, 12°C → 54°F, 24°C → 54 + 21.6 = 75.6°F, 36°C → 75.6 + 21.6 = 97.2°F.  

Now, let's see if these Fahrenheit values have digits that are "inverted" relative to the Celsius values:  

- 12°C → 54°F: 12 and 54. The digits are not reversed, but maybe the first digit of Celsius is the second digit of Fahrenheit? 12 → 54: 1 is the first digit of Celsius, 4 is the second digit of Fahrenheit. Not exactly.  

- 24°C → 75.6°F: 24 and 75.6. 24 reversed is 42, 75 is not 42.  

- 36°C → 97.2°F: 36 reversed is 63, 97 is not 63.  

Hmm, maybe the statement is referring to a specific case where the digits are inverted. Let's try to find such a case.  

For example: 13°C → 55.4°F. Wait, no.  

Wait, let's try 15°C → 59°F. 15 and 59: no.  

Wait, maybe the statement is a misinterpretation or a rough approximation. For example, if you remember that 12°C is about 54°F, and then every 12°C added, you add 21.6°F, so 24°C is about 75.6°F, 36°C is about 97.2°F. These are approximate values, and maybe the "digits are inverted" is a way to remember that the Fahrenheit value is higher than Celsius, and the digits are in a different order.  

But wait, let's think of a case where the digits are exactly inverted. For example: 12°C → 53.6°F. If we take 12 and 53.6, maybe the first digit of Celsius is the second digit of Fahrenheit? 12 → 53.6: 1 is the first digit of Celsius, 3 is the
