The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic that helps to quickly convert between the two temperature scales. Let's break it down with an example to illustrate how it works:

1. **Understanding the Scale**: Celsius and Fahrenheit are both temperature scales used to measure temperature. Celsius is a scale where water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C, while Fahrenheit uses water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F.

2. **Conversion Process**: To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you need to subtract 32 from the Celsius temperature and then multiply by 1.8. For example, if you have a temperature of 25°C, you would convert it to Fahrenheit as follows:
   \[
   25°C - 32 = -7°C
   \]
   \[
   -7°C \times 1.8 = -12.6°F
   \]

3. **Inverting the Digits**: The statement suggests that every 12°C, the digits are inverted. This means that if you have a temperature of 25°C, the inverted digits would be 25°F. Let's verify this:
   \[
   25°C \rightarrow 25°F
   \]
   \[
   25°F \rightarrow 25°C
   \]
   This confirms that the statement is correct.

4. **Example Conversion**: To convert 25°C to Fahrenheit using the inverted digits method:
   \[
   25°C \rightarrow 25°F
   \]
   \[
   25°F \rightarrow 25°C
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The statement is a mnemonic that helps to quickly remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit by using the inverted digits method. It is a useful tool for quick conversions in temperature measurements.

The final answer is: The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted. [end of text]
