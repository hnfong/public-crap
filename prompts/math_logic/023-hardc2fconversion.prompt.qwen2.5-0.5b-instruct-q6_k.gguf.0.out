The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic that helps remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let's break it down:

1. **Understanding the Conversion**: Celsius and Fahrenheit are both temperature scales used to measure temperature. The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
   \[
   F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
   \]
   where \( F \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \( C \) is the temperature in Celsius.

2. **Inverting the Digits**: The phrase suggests that every time you multiply the Celsius temperature by 12, the digits of the result are inverted. For example, if you have 12°C, you would multiply it by 12 and then add 32 to get 44°C. The digits of 44 are 4 and 4, which are inverted.

3. **Example Calculation**: Let's apply this to a specific example:
   - If you have 12°C, you would multiply it by 12 and then add 32 to get 44°C.
   - The digits of 44 are 4 and 4, which are inverted.

4. **Generalization**: This mnemonic can be generalized to any temperature conversion. For example, if you have 15°C, you would multiply it by 12 and then add 32 to get 156°C. The digits of 156 are 1 and 6, which are inverted.

5. **Application in Real Life**: This mnemonic can be used in various contexts, such as cooking, where you might want to convert temperatures to a more familiar scale like Fahrenheit. For example, if you're cooking and you want to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use this mnemonic to ensure the digits are inverted.

In summary, the phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic that helps remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It suggests that every time you multiply the Celsius temperature by 12, the digits of the result are inverted. [end of text]
