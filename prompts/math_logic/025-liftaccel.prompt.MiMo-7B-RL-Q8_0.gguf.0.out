Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. Hmm, starting with the first question: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) if the elevator accelerates/decelerates at 1 m/sÂ² and has a maximum speed of 5 m/s. 

So, the building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. That means the total height to climb is 40 floors * 5 m/floor = 200 meters. Wait, but actually, if it's from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F, that's 39 stories above ground, right? Because the ground floor is 1/F, so 40/F would be 39 floors up. Wait, hold on. Wait, sometimes in buildings, the ground floor is considered 1/F, and the next floor is 2/F, up to 40/F. So the total number of stories between ground and 40/F would be 39 floors? Or is it 40 floors? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall." So if it's a 40-story building, does that mean there are 40 floors above ground? Or is the ground floor considered one of the 40? Hmm. The wording says "a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between ground and top is 39 floors? Because from 1/F to 2/F is one floor, so 1/F to 40/F would be 39 floors. Each floor is 5 meters, so total height is 39 * 5 = 195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem counts the ground floor as 1/F, and each floor is 5m, so the height from ground to 1/F is 5m? Wait, that might not make sense. Usually, the ground floor is at ground level, and the first floor is 5m up. So from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F would be 39 floors above ground, each 5m, so 39*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the ground floor as 1/F, and each floor is 5m tall, so the height from 1/F to 2/F is 5m, so from 1/F to 40/F is 39 intervals of 5m, so 195m. But maybe the problem is different. Let me check again. The problem says: "Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So perhaps the ground floor is 1/F, and each subsequent floor is 5m higher. So the total height from ground (1/F) to 40/F is (40 - 1) * 5 m = 39*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the ground floor is considered 0/F, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different numbering. Let me confirm. If the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F), then the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so total height is 195 meters. Alternatively, maybe the ground floor is 0, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. So perhaps the total height is (40 - 1) * 5 = 195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that each floor is 5m, so from ground to 1/F is 5m, then 1/F to 2/F is another 5m, etc., so from 1/F to 40/F is 39 floors, each 5m, so 195m. So total distance is 195 meters. 

But wait, maybe the problem is simpler. If it's a 40-story building, each floor is 5m tall, so the total height from ground to the top is 40*5=200 meters. Wait, but that would be if the ground is considered 0/F, and each floor is 5m. But the problem says the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F. So maybe the ground floor is 1/F, and the next floors go up to 40/F. So the number of floors between 1/F and 40/F is 39 floors, each 5m, so 195m. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me check again. If the building has 40 stories, each floor is 5m tall. So the total height from the ground to the top floor is 40*5=200 meters. But if the ground floor is 1/F, then the height from 1/F to 40/F would be (40 - 1)*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the ground floor is considered as 1/F, so the first floor is at 5m, second at 10m, ..., 40/F at 195m? Wait, 40 floors *5m=200m. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the building has 40 floors above ground, each 5m. So from ground to 40/F is 40*5=200m. But the problem says "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)", which would imply that the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so 195m. Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to have 40 floors, each 5m, so total height is 200m. But the lift goes from 1/F to 40/F, which would be 39 floors, 195m. But maybe the problem is considering that the ground floor is 0/F, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different system where the ground floor is 1/F, and each floor is 5m. So the height from 1/F to 40/F is (40 -1)*5=195m. But perhaps the problem is intended to have 40 floors, each 5m, so total height is 200m. Maybe the problem is phrased as "a 40 story building", meaning that there are 40 stories, each 5m tall. So the total height from ground to the top is 40*5=200m. Then, if the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F, that's 40 stories, but each story is 5m. Wait, perhaps the problem is using "story" as the same as floor. So a 40-story building has 40 floors, each 5m tall. So the total height from ground to top is 40*5=200m. But if the lift starts at ground floor (1/F), then to get to 40/F, it's 39 stories up? Because from 1/F to 2/F is one story, so 1/F to 40/F is 39 stories. So 39*5=195m. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so 195m. But maybe the problem counts
