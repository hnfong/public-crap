Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. Hmm, starting with the first question: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) if the elevator accelerates/decelerates at 1 m/s² and has a maximum speed of 5 m/s. 

So, the building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. That means the total height to climb is 40 floors * 5 m/floor = 200 meters. Wait, but actually, if it's from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F, that's 39 stories above ground, right? Because the ground floor is 1/F, so 40/F would be 39 floors up. Wait, hold on. Wait, sometimes in buildings, the ground floor is considered 1/F, and the next floor is 2/F, up to 40/F. So the total number of stories between ground and 40/F would be 39 floors? Or is it 40 floors? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall." So if it's a 40-story building, does that mean there are 40 floors above ground? Or is the ground floor considered one of the 40? Hmm. The wording says "a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between ground and top is 39 floors? Because from 1/F to 2/F is one floor, so 1/F to 40/F would be 39 floors. Each floor is 5 meters, so total height is 39 * 5 = 195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem counts the ground floor as 1/F, and each floor is 5m, so the height from ground to 1/F is 5m? Wait, that might not make sense. Usually, the ground floor is at ground level, and the first floor is 5m up. So from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F would be 39 floors above ground, each 5m, so 39*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the ground floor as 1/F, and each floor is 5m tall, so the height from 1/F to 2/F is 5m, so from 1/F to 40/F is 39 intervals of 5m, so 195m. But maybe the problem is different. Let me check again. The problem says: "Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So perhaps the ground floor is 1/F, and each subsequent floor is 5m higher. So the total height from ground (1/F) to 40/F is (40 - 1) * 5 m = 39*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the ground floor is considered 0/F, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different numbering. Let me confirm. If the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F), then the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so total height is 195 meters. Alternatively, maybe the ground floor is 0, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. So perhaps the total height is (40 - 1) * 5 = 195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that each floor is 5m, so from ground to 1/F is 5m, then 1/F to 2/F is another 5m, etc., so from 1/F to 40/F is 39 floors, each 5m, so 195m. So total distance is 195 meters. 

But wait, maybe the problem is simpler. If it's a 40-story building, each floor is 5m tall, so the total height from ground to the top is 40*5=200 meters. Wait, but that would be if the ground is considered 0/F, and each floor is 5m. But the problem says the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F. So maybe the ground floor is 1/F, and the next floors go up to 40/F. So the number of floors between 1/F and 40/F is 39 floors, each 5m, so 195m. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me check again. If the building has 40 stories, each floor is 5m tall. So the total height from the ground to the top floor is 40*5=200 meters. But if the ground floor is 1/F, then the height from 1/F to 40/F would be (40 - 1)*5=195 meters. Wait, but maybe the ground floor is considered as 1/F, so the first floor is at 5m, second at 10m, ..., 40/F at 195m? Wait, 40 floors *5m=200m. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the building has 40 floors above ground, each 5m. So from ground to 40/F is 40*5=200m. But the problem says "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)", which would imply that the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so 195m. Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to have 40 floors, each 5m, so total height is 200m. But the lift goes from 1/F to 40/F, which would be 39 floors, 195m. But maybe the problem is considering that the ground floor is 0/F, and 1/F is the first floor. But the problem says ground floor is 1/F. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different system where the ground floor is 1/F, and each floor is 5m. So the height from 1/F to 40/F is (40 -1)*5=195m. But perhaps the problem is intended to have 40 floors, each 5m, so total height is 200m. Maybe the problem is phrased as "a 40 story building", meaning that there are 40 stories, each 5m tall. So the total height from ground to the top is 40*5=200m. Then, if the lift goes from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F, that's 40 stories, but each story is 5m. Wait, perhaps the problem is using "story" as the same as floor. So a 40-story building has 40 floors, each 5m tall. So the total height from ground to top is 40*5=200m. But if the lift starts at ground floor (1/F), then to get to 40/F, it's 39 stories up? Because from 1/F to 2/F is one story, so 1/F to 40/F is 39 stories. So 39*5=195m. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So the ground floor is 1/F, and the top is 40/F. So the number of floors between them is 39, each 5m, so 195m. But maybe the problem counts the ground floor as 1/F, and each subsequent floor is 5m higher. So the height from 1/F to 40/F is (40 -1)*5=195m. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the ground floor is at 0m, and each floor is 5m, so 1/F is at 5m, ..., 40/F is at 40*5=200m. Then the lift goes from 0m (ground) to 200m. Wait, but the problem says the ground floor is 1/F. So perhaps the height from 1/F to 40/F is (40-1)*5=195m. But maybe the problem is intended to have 40 floors, each 5m, so total height 200m, and the lift goes from 1/F to 40/F, which is 39 stories of 5m each, so 195m. Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting 200m. Let me proceed with that assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler: if each floor is 5m tall, then the total height from ground to 40/F is 40*5=200m. Because the building has 40 stories, each 5m tall. So regardless of the floor numbering, the total height is 40*5=200m. So maybe the answer expects 200m. Let's go with that for now. 

So, the elevator needs to travel 200 meters. The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s², decelerates at 1 m/s², and has a maximum speed of 5 m/s. So the elevator will accelerate until it reaches the maximum speed, then cruise at that speed, then decelerate to stop. 

First, we need to determine if the elevator can reach the maximum speed before needing to decelerate. The total distance is 200m. Let's calculate the time it takes to accelerate to 5 m/s. Using the kinematic equation: v = u + a*t. Starting from rest (u=0), so 5 = 0 + 1*t => t=5 seconds. In that time, the distance covered during acceleration is (1/2)*a*t² = 0.5*1*25=12.5 meters. Then, if it continues at 5 m/s, but eventually needs to decelerate. The deceleration is also 1 m/s². The time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 is t=5 seconds (same as acceleration phase), and the distance during deceleration is (1/2)*a*t²=12.5 meters. 

So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 +12.5=25 meters. The remaining distance is 200 -25=175 meters. This must be covered at the cruising speed of 5 m/s. Time taken for cruising is distance/speed=175/5=35 seconds. 

Total time is acceleration time + cruising time + deceleration time=5+35+5=45 seconds. 

Wait, but let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe the elevator can't reach the maximum speed because the distance required to accelerate and decelerate is more than the total distance. Wait, in this case, the total distance is 200m. The elevator accelerates for t1 seconds to reach 5 m/s, then cruises for t2 seconds, then decelerates for t3 seconds. The total distance is (1/2)*a*t1² + 5*t2 + (1/2)*a*t3². Since acceleration and deceleration are both 1 m/s², t1 = t3 = 5 seconds (since 5=0+1*t). The distance during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 +12.5=25m. Then the cruising distance is 200-25=175m, which at 5 m/s takes 35 seconds. So total time is 5+35+5=45 seconds. That seems correct. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's use the formula for distance covered during acceleration and deceleration. If the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches max speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s², the total distance during acceleration and deceleration phases is (v²)/(2a) + (v²)/(2a) = v²/a. Since v=5 m/s, then (25)/1=25 meters. Which matches the previous calculation. Then the remaining distance is 200-25=175 meters at 5 m/s, time=35s. Total time=25/(5) +35? Wait, no. Wait, the time to accelerate is t1=5s, time to decelerate t3=5s, and time to cruise t2=35s. So total time=5+35+5=45s. Yes. 

So the answer to question 1 is 45 seconds. 

Now question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take? 

Assuming the lift has to stop at both 10/F and 30/F. Wait, but maybe the lift will first go to 10/F, then to 30/F. But the problem says "how long does it take". So perhaps the lift will go up, stop at 10/F, then continue to 30/F. But depending on the order, maybe the lift goes to the higher floor first. Wait, but usually, when multiple people get on, the elevator goes to the highest floor first, then comes back down. But in this case, the two people are getting on at the ground floor, and one wants 10/F, the other 30/F. So the elevator would go to 30/F first, then stop at 10/F on the way down? Or does it go to 10/F first, then to 30/F? The problem says "how long does it take", so we need to assume the path. 

But perhaps the elevator will go to the highest floor first, which is 30/F, then on the way down, stop at 10/F. But the problem says "the lift goes from the ground floor to the top floor", but in this case, the passengers are going to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator needs to stop at both 10/F and 30/F. 

Wait, but the problem says "the lift goes from the ground floor to the top floor (40/F)". So maybe the elevator's default is to go to the top floor, but in this case, two people are getting on and going to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator will have to go to both floors. 

Assuming that the elevator will first go to the highest floor requested, which is 30/F, then on the way down, stop at 10/F. But the problem says "how long does it take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F" in question 3. Wait, question 3 is separate. For question 2, the two people are going to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator needs to stop at both 10/F and 30/F. 

So the total distance the elevator needs to travel is from ground (1/F) to 30/F, then down to 10/F, then back down to ground? Or wait, no. Wait, the passengers are getting on at ground floor, and each wants to go to their respective floors. So the elevator will take them both. So the elevator will go up to 30/F, stop there, then go down to 10/F, stop there, then go back down to ground? Or maybe the elevator goes up to 10/F first, then up to 30/F. But usually, elevators go to the highest floor first. 

Assuming the elevator goes to 30/F first. So from ground (1/F) to 30/F. Then from 30/F down to 10/F, then from 10/F down to ground. But the problem says "how long does it take". So the total time would be the time to go from 1/F to 30/F, then from 30/F to 10/F, then from 10/F back to 1/F. But wait, the passengers are getting on at ground floor (1/F), and they want to go to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator will take them both. So the elevator will go to 30/F, then on the way down, pick up the person going to 10/F, then continue to ground. Wait, but once the elevator goes to 30/F, both passengers would have reached their destinations? No, because one is going to 10/F and the other to 30/F. So when the elevator goes to 30/F, the second passenger gets off, then the elevator needs to go back down to 10/F to drop off the first passenger. Then back to ground. But that seems inefficient. Alternatively, maybe the elevator goes to 10/F first, then to 30/F. But in reality, elevators typically go to the highest floor first. 

But the problem might be simplified. Let's assume that the elevator will stop at both 10/F and 30/F on the way up. Wait, but if both passengers are getting on at the ground floor, and the elevator is going to take them to their floors, then the elevator would need to go to 30/F, then on the way down, go to 10/F. But the total time would be the time to go from 1/F to 30/F, then from 30/F to 10/F, then from 10/F back to 1/F. But the passengers only need to go to their respective floors. So once the elevator reaches 30/F, the second passenger gets off, then the elevator needs to go back down to 10/F to drop off the first passenger, then back to ground. But that would involve a lot of back and forth. Alternatively, maybe the elevator goes to 10/F first, then to 30/F. But in that case, the elevator would go up to 10/F, stop, then continue up to 30/F. Then return to ground. But the problem says "how long does it take", so we need to calculate the total time for the elevator to complete the trip to both floors and return to ground? Or just the time until both passengers are delivered. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler: the elevator is taking both passengers to their floors. So the elevator will go to the higher floor (30/F), then on the way down, stop at 10/F. So the total time is the time to go from 1/F to 30/F, then from 30/F to 10/F, and then from 10/F back to 1/F? Or maybe not. Let's think. The passengers board at 1/F. The elevator needs to take them to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator will go to 30/F first, taking that passenger there, then on the way down, stop at 10/F for the other passenger, then continue to ground. So the total distance is from 1/F to 30/F (height difference of 30-1=29 floors? Wait, each floor is 5m, so 29*5=145m. Wait, but earlier we considered the total height to 40/F as 200m. So from 1/F to 30/F is (30-1)*5=145m. Then from 30/F down to 10/F is (30-10)*5=100m. Then from 10/F down to 1/F is (10-1)*5=45m. So total distance traveled is 145+100+45=290m. But wait, the elevator is moving in different directions. But the problem is about time, not distance. 

But we need to model the elevator's movement with acceleration and deceleration. Let's break it down into segments: 

1. Accelerating from 1/F to 30/F. 
2. Decelerating at 30/F to stop. 
3. Then accelerating down from 30/F to 10/F (since it needs to go down to 10/F). 
4. Decelerating at 10/F to stop. 
5. Then accelerating down from 10/F to 1/F. 
6. Decelerating at 1/F to stop (ground). 

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the elevator goes up to 30/F, then goes down to 10/F, then back down to 1/F. Each segment involves acceleration and deceleration. 

But perhaps we can calculate the time for each segment. Let's start with the first segment: from 1/F to 30/F. The height difference is 29 floors (since from 1/F to 30/F is 29 intervals of 5m, so 145m). 

The elevator needs to travel 145m upwards. It accelerates at 1 m/s², reaches max speed of 5 m/s, then cruises, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at 30/F. 

First, check if it can reach the maximum speed before needing to decelerate. 

The distance required to accelerate to 5 m/s is (v²)/(2a) = 25/2 =12.5m. Then the distance required to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 is also 12.5m. So total distance for acceleration and deceleration is 25m. The remaining distance is 145 -25=120m, which is covered at cruising speed. Time cruising: 120/5=24s. Total time for 1/F to 30/F: acceleration time (5s) + cruising (24s) + deceleration (5s)=34s. 

Then, the elevator needs to go down from 30/F to 10/F. That's 20 floors down, 100m. Now, going down, the elevator will decelerate, possibly reach max speed (but since it's descending, maybe it's moving downward, so acceleration would be in the downward direction? Wait, the problem says "acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s²". So when going down, the elevator would decelerate (brake) at 1 m/s². Wait, perhaps when going down, the elevator accelerates downward at 1 m/s², but that's not typical. Usually, elevators when going down can have a different profile, but the problem states acceleration/deceleration is 1 m/s². So perhaps when going down, the elevator accelerates downward at 1 m/s² until it reaches the maximum speed (5 m/s downward?), then cruises, then decelerates. But the problem says maximum speed is 5 m/s. So maybe the elevator can't go down faster than 5 m/s. 

Wait, the problem says "its maximum speed is 5m/s". So regardless of direction, the maximum speed is 5 m/s. So when going down, the elevator can't exceed 5 m/s downward. 

So for the downward trip from 30/F to 10/F (100m), the elevator will start from rest (at 30/F), accelerate downward at 1 m/s² until it reaches 5 m/s, then cruise, then decelerate at 1 m/s² to stop at 10/F. 

Calculating the distance required to accelerate to 5 m/s downward: same as before, (v²)/(2a) =25/2=12.5m. Then deceleration distance 12.5m. So total acceleration/deceleration distance 25m. The remaining distance is 100-25=75m. Time cruising:75/5=15s. Total time for 30/F to 10/F: acceleration (5s) + cruising (15s) + deceleration (5s)=25s. 

Then, the elevator needs to go back down from 10/F to 1/F (ground floor). That's 9 floors, 45m. Again, starting from rest, accelerating downward. Distance to reach 5 m/s:12.5m. Then decelerate:12.5m. Total 25m. But the distance is only 45m. So the elevator can't reach the maximum speed. So we need to calculate the time for this 45m drop. 

Let's use the equation: s = (1/2)*a*t², since it starts from rest. Here, a=1 m/s² downward, s=45m. So 45=0.5*1*t² => t²=90 => t=√90≈9.4868s. But wait, the elevator can't exceed 5 m/s. Let's check if during this 45m drop, the elevator reaches 5 m/s. The time to reach 5 m/s is t=5/1=5s. In that time, the distance covered is 0.5*1*25=12.5m. Then remaining distance is 45-12.5=32.5m. But the elevator needs to decelerate to stop at 1/F. The deceleration is 1 m/s². The time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 is 5s, distance=12.5m. But we only have 32.5m left. So the elevator can't reach the maximum speed because after accelerating for 5s (12.5m), it still has 32.5m to go. But it needs to decelerate. So perhaps it accelerates for some time t1, then decelerates. 

Let me model this. The elevator needs to cover 45m with acceleration and deceleration. Let's denote t1 as time accelerating, t2 as time decelerating. The total distance is 0.5*a*t1² + v*t2 +0.5*a*t2² =45m. But the final velocity after acceleration is v= a*t1=1*t1. Then during deceleration, the velocity decreases from v to 0, so t2=v/a= t1/1= t1. Wait, no. If the elevator accelerates for t1 seconds, reaching speed v=1*t1, then decelerates at 1 m/s² for t2 seconds, ending at 0. The distance during acceleration is 0.5*1*t1². The distance during deceleration is v*t2 -0.5*1*t2² = t1*t2 -0.5*t2². But since the final velocity is 0, we have v -a*t2=0 => t1 -1*t2=0 => t2=t1. So total distance is 0.5*t1² + t1*t1 -0.5*t1²= t1². Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's do it properly. 

During acceleration phase: starts at 0, accelerates at 1 m/s² for t1 seconds. Velocity at end of acceleration: v=1*t1. Distance covered: 0.5*1*t1². 

Then decelerate at 1 m/s² for t2 seconds, ending at 0. The distance during deceleration is (v^2)/(2a) = (t1²)/(2*1)=0.5*t1². Wait, no. The distance during deceleration is (v²)/(2a) = (t1²)/(2*1)=0.5*t1². So total distance is 0.5*t1² +0.5*t1²= t1². We need t1²=45m => t1=√45≈6.708s. But wait, this would mean that the elevator doesn't reach the maximum speed of 5 m/s. Because if t1=6.708s, then the velocity would be 6.708 m/s, which exceeds the maximum speed of 5 m/s. So this is a problem. 

Therefore, the elevator cannot accelerate for the entire time. It must reach the maximum speed of 5 m/s. So let's check if the elevator can reach 5 m/s before needing to decelerate. 

If the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches 5 m/s, which takes t=5s, covering 0.5*1*25=12.5m. Then it needs to decelerate. The remaining distance is 45-12.5=32.5m. During deceleration, the distance covered is (v²)/(2a)=25/2=12.5m. But 12.5m >32.5m? No, 12.5m is less than 32.5m. Wait, no. Wait, during deceleration from 5 m/s to 0, the distance is 12.5m. So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5+12.5=25m. But we have 45m to cover. So the elevator can accelerate to 5 m/s, cruise for some time, then decelerate. 

Wait, but in this case, the elevator is going from 10/F to 1/F, which is descending. So the total distance is 45m. Let's model it properly. 

The elevator starts at rest, accelerates downward at 1 m/s² until it reaches 5 m/s (which takes 5s), then cruises at 5 m/s for t seconds, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at 1/F. 

The total distance is: acceleration distance + cruising distance + deceleration distance. 

Acceleration distance: 0.5*1*(5)^2=12.5m. 

Deceleration distance: same as acceleration, 12.5m. 

Cruising distance:5*t. 

Total distance:12.5 +5t +12.5=25 +5t=45 =>5t=20 =>t=4s. 

So cruising time is 4s. 

Total time:5s (accel) +4s (cruise) +5s (decel)=14s. 

But wait, during cruising, the elevator is moving downward at 5 m/s for 4s, covering 20m. Then decelerates for 5s, covering 12.5m. Total distance:12.5+20+12.5=45m. Correct. 

So the time for the 10/F to 1/F trip is 14s. 

Now, summing up all the times: 

1. 1/F to 30/F:34s 

2. 30/F to 10/F:25s 

3. 10/F to 1/F:14s 

Total time=34+25+14=73s. 

But wait, the problem says "how long does it take". Does this include the time until both passengers are delivered? Once the elevator reaches 30/F, the second passenger is dropped off. Then the elevator goes down to 10/F (25s), drops off the first passenger, then goes back down to 1/F (14s). So the total time from when they board until both are at their floors is 34+25+14=73s. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the elevator only needs to go to the highest floor (30/F), then the other passenger will get off on the way down. But the first passenger is going to 10/F, so the elevator must stop there. So the total time is the time to go to 30/F, then to 10/F, then back to ground. But the passengers only need to go to their floors, so once they are dropped off, they don't need to stay on the elevator. So the total time is the time until both are delivered. So yes, 34+25+14=73 seconds. 

But let me verify the calculations again. 

First segment: 1/F to 30/F (145m). 

Acceleration phase: t1=5s, distance=12.5m. 

Cruising distance:145-12.5-12.5=120m. Time=120/5=24s. 

Deceleration phase:5s. 

Total time:5+24+5=34s. Correct. 

Second segment:30/F to 10/F (100m). 

Acceleration phase:5s, 12.5m. 

Cruising:100-12.5-12.5=75m. Time=15s. 

Deceleration:5s. 

Total time:5+15+5=25s. Correct. 

Third segment:10/F to 1/F (45m). 

Acceleration to 5m/s:5s, 12.5m. 

Cruising:45-12.5-12.5=20m. Time=4s. 

Deceleration:5s. 

Total time:5+4+5=14s. Correct. 

Total time=34+25+14=73s=1min13s. 

But maybe there's a different approach. Suppose the elevator goes to 10/F first, then to 30/F. Let's calculate that. 

First segment:1/F to 10/F (9 floors, 45m). 

Acceleration:5s, 12.5m. 

Cruising:45-12.5-12.5=20m. Time=4s. 

Deceleration:5s. 

Total time:5+4+5=14s. 

Then from 10/F to 30/F (20 floors, 100m). 

Acceleration:5s, 12.5m. 

Cruising:100-12.5-12.5=75m. Time=15s. 

Deceleration:5s. 

Total time:5+15+5=25s. 

Then from 30/F back to 1/F: same as before, 14s. 

Total time=14+25+14=53s. Wait, this is different. 

Wait, this depends on the order in which the elevator visits the floors. If it goes to 10/F first, then to 30/F, then back to ground, the total time is 14+25+14=53s. But which order is correct? 

In reality, elevators typically go to the highest floor first. So the 30/F passenger would be dropped off first, then the elevator goes down to 10/F. So total time 73s. But maybe the problem assumes that the elevator goes to both floors on the way up, but that's not possible unless it stops at both on the way up. But if both passengers are getting on at the ground floor, the elevator would need to stop at both 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator would go to 30/F, then on the way down, stop at 10/F. So the total time is 73s. 

But perhaps the problem is simpler, assuming that the elevator goes to the highest floor (30/F) first, then the lower floor (10/F) on the way down, and the total time is the time to reach 30/F plus the time to reach 10/F from 30/F. But the passengers board at ground floor, so once the elevator reaches 30/F, the second passenger gets off, then the elevator goes down to 10/F, drops off the first passenger, then continues to ground. So the total time is the time to 30/F plus time from 30/F to 10/F plus time from 10/F to 1/F. Which is 34+25+14=73s. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the elevator only needs to go to the highest floor (30/F), and the other passenger will get off on the way down, but the problem says two people go to 10/F and 30/F. So the elevator must stop at both. Therefore, the answer is 73 seconds. 

But let's check if there's a different way. Maybe the elevator can combine the trips more efficiently. For example, going to 30/F, then to 10/F, then back to ground. But the calculation remains the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate the time to go to 30/F and then to 10/F, ignoring the return trip. But the problem says "how long does it take", implying until both passengers are delivered. Once they are delivered, the elevator's further movements might not be considered. But usually, the elevator would return to ground, but the problem might not require that. 

Wait, the problem says "how long does it take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F" in question 3. But for question 2, it's about the two people getting on and going to 10/F and 30/F. The lift's total time to take them both would be until both have reached their floors. So once the elevator reaches 30/F and then 10/F, the total time is the time until the elevator has stopped at both floors. So the elevator starts at 1/F, goes to 30/F (34s), then goes to 10/F (25s). So total time is 34+25=59s. But wait, after dropping off the 30/F passenger, it needs to go to 10/F. The time from 30/F to 10/F is 25s. So total time is 34+25=59s. Then, once it drops off the 10/F passenger, does it need to return to ground? The problem says "how long does it take", which might mean from when the passengers board until they have reached their floors. So once the elevator has dropped off both passengers, the time is 34+25=59s. Because after dropping off the 10/F passenger, the passengers can get off, and the elevator's further movement is irrelevant. 

Wait, that makes sense. The passengers are getting on at ground floor, and the time it takes for them to reach their respective floors. So the first passenger goes to 10/F, the second to 30/F. The elevator will first go to 30/F, taking 34s, then on the way down, stop at 10/F, taking 25s. So the total time from when they board until the last passenger (the one to 30/F) has reached their floor is 34s. But the passenger to 10/F would reach their floor at 34+25=59s. But the problem says "how long does it take", which might mean the total time until both passengers have been dropped off. So the answer would be 59s. 

But this depends on interpretation. If the elevator is serving both passengers, the time until both have been dropped off is 59s. Because the passenger to 30
