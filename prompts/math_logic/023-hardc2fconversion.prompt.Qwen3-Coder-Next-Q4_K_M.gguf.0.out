Let’s carefully analyze the claim:

> **“The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted.”**

At first glance, this sounds like a mnemonic or pattern for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit — specifically, that when the Celsius temperature increases by 12°C, the Fahrenheit temperature’s *digits are inverted* (e.g., 21°F ↔ 12°F, or 32°F ↔ 23°F, etc.).

But let’s test this with actual conversions.

---

### 🔁 First, recall the exact conversion formula:

\[
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
\]

So for a given Celsius temperature \(C\), compute \(F\), and see if increasing \(C\) by 12 causes the *digits of F* to invert.

Let’s try some values:

| C (°C) | F = (9/5)C + 32 | F value | Digits of F | Next C = C+12 | Next F | Digits of next F | Is it digit-inverted? |
|--------|------------------|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| 0      | 32               | 32      | 3, 2        | 12             | 53.6   | 5, 3.6           | ❌ (53.6 ≠ 23)         |
| 10     | 50               | 50      | 5, 0        | 22             | 71.6   | 7, 1.6           | ❌                     |
| 20     | 68               | 68      | 6, 8        | 32             | 89.6   | 8, 9.6           | ❌                     |
| 25     | 77               | 77      | 7, 7        | 37             | 98.6   | 9, 8.6           | ❌                     |
| 30     | 86               | 86      | 8, 6        | 42             | 107.6  | 1, 0, 7.6        | ❌ (3-digit now)       |

No clear digit inversion.

But wait — maybe the claim is about *approximate* conversions? A common rough rule is:

> **°F ≈ 2×°C + 30**

Let’s test that:

| C | Approx F = 2C + 30 | Exact F = 1.8C + 32 |
|---|--------------------|---------------------|
| 10 | 50 | 50 ✅ |
| 15 | 60 | 59 ✅ |
| 20 | 70 | 68 ❌ (off by 2) |
| 25 | 80 | 77 ❌ (off by 3) |
| 30 | 90 | 86 ❌ |

Still no digit inversion.

---

### 🧠 Maybe the claim is misphrased — could it be about *specific pairs* where digits invert?

Let’s search for Celsius–Fahrenheit pairs where the numbers are digit reverses.

Suppose:
- \(C = ab\) (two-digit number, e.g., 12), and  
- \(F = ba\) (e.g., 21), or vice versa.

Try solving:
\[
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
\]
and suppose \(F = \text{reverse}(C)\), for two-digit integers.

Let \(C = 10a + b\), so \(F = 10b + a\). Then:

\[
10b + a = \frac{9}{5}(10a + b) + 32
\]

Multiply both sides by 5:

\[
50b + 5a = 9(10a + b) + 160 = 90a + 9b + 160
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
50b + 5a - 90a - 9b - 160 = 0 \\
(50b - 9b) + (5a - 90a) - 160 = 0 \\
41b - 85a - 160 = 0
\]

So:
\[
41b = 85a + 160 \\
b = \frac{85a + 160}{41}
\]

Try integer \(a = 1\) to \(9\):

- \(a = 1\): \(b = (85 + 160)/41 = 245/41 ≈ 5.975\) ❌  
- \(a = 2\): \(b = (170 + 160)/41 = 330/41 ≈ 8.05\) ❌  
- \(a = 3\): \(b = (255 + 160)/41 = 415/41 = 10.12\) ❌ (b must be ≤9)  
- \(a = 0\): \(b = 160/41 ≈ 3.9\) → C = 03 = 3, F = 33? But F(3°C) = 37.4 ❌

No integer solution.

What about *Fahrenheit to Celsius* digit reversal? Try known pairs:

- 32°F = 0°C  
- 50°F = 10°C  
- 68°F = 20°C  
- 86°F = 30°C  
- 104°F = 40°C  
- 122°F = 50°C  

Notice:  
- 32°F ↔ 0°C  
- 50°F ↔ 10°C  
- 68°F ↔ 20°C  
- 86°F ↔ 30°C  
- 104°F ↔ 40°C  
- 122°F ↔ 50°C  

Look at the **Fahrenheit values**: 32, 50, 68, 86, 104, 122  
The tens digit increases by ~2 each time, but no digit inversion.

Wait — here’s something interesting:

- **12°C = 53.6°F**  
- **21°C = 69.8°F**  
No inversion.

But what about **-12°C**?  
- \(-12°C = 10.4°F\)  
- \(-21°C = -5.8°F\)  
No.

Hold on — maybe the claim is *about the difference*?

Let’s compute ΔF for ΔC = 12:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot \Delta C = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 12 = 21.6
\]

So every +12°C → +21.6°F.

21.6 is *close to* 22 — and 22 reversed is 22. Not helpful.

But 21.6 ≈ 22, and 12 reversed is 21 — aha!

**12°C → +21.6°F**, and **12 reversed is 21**, which is *very close* to 21.6.

So perhaps the idea is:

> When Celsius increases by **12**, Fahrenheit increases by **≈21.6**, and **12 ↔ 21** are digit reverses.

That’s the *only* sense in which “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” makes sense — but it’s not about the *actual temperatures*, it’s about the *change*.

Let’s verify:

| Start C | Start F | ΔC = +12 | New C | ΔF = +21.6 | New F | New F = Old F + 21.6? |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|------------|-------|------------------------|
| 0       | 32      | +12      | 12    | +21.6      | 53.6  | ✅ (32 + 21.6 = 53.6) |
| 10      | 50      | +12      | 22    | +21.6      | 71.6  | ✅ (50 + 21.6 = 71.6) |
| 25      | 77      | +12      | 37    | +21.6      | 98.6  | ✅ (77 + 21.6 = 98.6) |

So the *increment* is always **+21.6°F**, and **12°C ↔ 21.6°F** — and 12 and 21 are digit reverses (ignoring the .6).

That’s likely the intended (though poorly worded) mnemonic.

But is it *useful*? Not really — because:
- 21.6 is not exactly 21 (just close),
- You still need the base formula,
- And digit reversal is only approximate and coincidental.

A better, *actual* easy approximation is:

> **°F ≈ °C × 2 + 30**  
> (e.g., 20°C ≈ 70°F; actual = 68°F — close enough for weather)

Or for quick mental math:
- Subtract 30 from °F, then halve → approx °C.

### ✅ Summary:

The statement **“every 12°C, the digits are inverted”** is **not literally true** for temperature values, but it *hints* at the fact that:

- A change of **12°C** corresponds to
