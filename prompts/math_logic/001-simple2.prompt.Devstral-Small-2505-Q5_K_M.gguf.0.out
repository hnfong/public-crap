Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance:

1. **Factorial**: It is the product of the first five positive integers (1*2*3*4*5), which is denoted as 5!.
2. **Highly Composite Number**: It is the smallest number with 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).
3. **Pentagonal Number**: It is the 10th pentagonal number, which is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the pentagon.
4. **Significance in Time**: There are 120 minutes in 2 hours, and 120 seconds in 2 minutes.
5. **Significance in Religion**: In Christianity, there are 120 disciples of Jesus in the New Testament (Acts 1:15).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
x = [7 ± 11] / 2

So, the solutions are:
x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make in a day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. So, the time taken for one trip is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours

Since a round trip involves going to the other city and coming back, the time taken for a round trip is:

Time for round trip = 2 * Time for one trip = 2 * 3.33 hours = 6.66 hours

Now, there are 24 hours in a day, so the number of round trips the train can make in a day is:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.66 hours ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips in a day. [end of text]
