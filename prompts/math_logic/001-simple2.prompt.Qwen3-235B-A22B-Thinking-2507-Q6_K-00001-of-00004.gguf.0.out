Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Interesting properties.

First, I know 120 is a composite number. Let me think about its factors. 120 divided by 2 is 60, then 3 is 40, 4 is 30, 5 is 24, 6 is 20, 8 is 15, 10 is 12. So it has a lot of factors. Maybe it's a highly composite number? I think 120 is a highly composite number because it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me check: numbers like 60 have 12 divisors, 120 has 16? Wait, divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors. Yes, so it's highly composite.

Also, 120 is 5 factorial (5!) because 5×4×3×2×1=120. That's a key point. Factorials are significant in combinatorics.

Another thing: 120 is a triangular number? Wait, triangular numbers are n(n+1)/2. Let's see: 15×16/2=120. Yes! 15th triangular number. So 1+2+...+15=120.

Also, 120 is a tetrahedral number, which is the sum of triangular numbers. The formula is n(n+1)(n+2)/6. Let's check for n=8: 8×9×10/6=720/6=120. So yes, 8th tetrahedral number.

In geometry, a regular dodecahedron has 120 symmetries? Wait, no, the order of the icosahedral group is 120, which is the symmetry group of the dodecahedron and icosahedron. Yes, that's right.

Also, 120 is a Harshad number in base 10 because it's divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0=3, 120/3=40).

In music, there are 120 beats per minute as a tempo, but that's more cultural. Maybe not as mathematical.

So significance includes factorial, highly composite, triangular, tetrahedral, symmetry group order, Harshad number.

Q2: Solve x² -7x -18=0.

Quadratic equation. Use quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2. Because discriminant D = b²-4ac = (-7)^2 -4*1*(-18)=49 +72=121. sqrt(121)=11. So x=(7±11)/2. So two solutions: (7+11)/2=18/2=9, and (7-11)/2=-4/2=-2. So x=9 and x=-2.

Alternatively, factorizing: looking for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Wait, the equation is x² -7x -18, so factors would be (x - a)(x + b) where a*b=18 and a - b=7. Let's see: 9 and 2: 9*2=18, 9-2=7. So (x -9)(x +2)=x² -7x -18. Yes, so roots at 9 and -2.

Q3: Train speed 60 km/h, distance 200 km apart. Round trip is 400 km. Time for one round trip: distance/speed = 400/60 = 6.666... hours, which is 6 hours 40 minutes.

Full day is 24 hours. How many round trips in 24 hours?

Number of trips = 24 / (400/60) = 24 * (60/400) = (24*60)/400 = 1440/400 = 3.6. But since you can't do a fraction of a round trip, it's 3 full round trips. Wait, but need to check if 3.6 means 3 full trips and part of a 4th. But the question says "how many round trips can it make", so only complete ones.

Wait, let's calculate time for one way: 200 km /60 km/h = 3.333... hours (3h20m). Round trip is 6h40m, which is 20/3 hours (since 6 + 2/3 = 20/3).

24 hours divided by (20/3) hours per round trip = 24 * 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6. So 3 full round trips, as 3*20/3=20 hours, leaving 4 hours, which isn't enough for another round trip (needs 6h40m).

Wait, 3 round trips take 3*(400/60)= 1200/60=20 hours. 24-20=4 hours left. In 4 hours, the train can go 60*4=240 km, which is more than 200 km one way, but a round trip needs 400 km. So 240 km is only one way (200) plus 40 km back, which isn't a full round trip. So yes, only 3 round trips.

Wait, but maybe the question allows partial trips? But it says "how many round trips", which implies complete ones. So answer is 3.

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**  
The number **120** has several notable mathematical and cultural significances:

#### **Steps to Identify Properties:**
1. **Factorial (5!):**  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $. This makes it significant in combinatorics for permutations and combinations.

2. **Highly Composite Number:**  
   - Divisors of 120: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 $ (16 total).  
   - It has more divisors than any smaller positive integer, making it a *highly composite number*.

3. **Triangular Number:**  
   - The $ n $-th triangular number is $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $.  
   - For $ n = 15 $: $ \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120 $.  
   - So, 120 is the **15th triangular number**.

4. **Tetrahedral Number:**  
   - The $ n $-th tetrahedral number is $ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} $.  
   - For $ n = 8 $: $ \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6} = 120 $.  
   - Thus, 120 is the **8th tetrahedral number**.

5. **Symmetry in Geometry:**  
   - The symmetry group of the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron (icosahedral group) has **120 elements**, representing all rotational symmetries.

6. **Harshad Number:**  
   - A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits.  
   - Sum of digits: $ 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 $, and $ 120 \div 3 = 40 $.  
   - Hence, 120 is a **Harshad number** in base 10.

7. **C
