"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12Â°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is referring to a pattern in the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales. Specifically, it means that every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted, meaning the ones digit and the tens digit switch places. However, it's important to note that this is an approximate conversion and not entirely accurate.

Let's take a look at a few examples to illustrate this pattern:

- At 0 degrees Celsius, the temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
- At 12 degrees Celsius, the temperature is approximately 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The digits are not exactly inverted, but if you round to the nearest whole number, you get 54 degrees Fahrenheit.
- At 24 degrees Celsius, the temperature is approximately 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Again, the digits are not exactly inverted, but if you round to the nearest whole number, you get 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
- At 36 degrees Celsius, the temperature is approximately 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit. If you round to the nearest whole number, you get 97 degrees Fahrenheit, which does have inverted digits.

So, while this pattern can be a useful mnemonic to remember the general relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures, it's not an entirely accurate conversion method. For precise conversions, it's best to use a formula or a conversion chart. The exact formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is: F = (9/5)C + 32.
