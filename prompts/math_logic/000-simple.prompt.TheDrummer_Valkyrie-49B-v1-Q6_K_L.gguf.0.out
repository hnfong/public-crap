Q4: 349*683=238,627

Q5: 6043*7489=45,245,127

Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20.

Q8: The total amount given to the shopkeeper is 2*20 + 5 = $45. The cost of the book is $15. The change should be 45 - 15 = $30.

Q9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So, 4 * 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so in total, there are 1 (Katherine) + 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) = 4 children.

Q11: Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), first perform the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

Q12: The number of slices needed depends on how many slices each guest will have. Assuming each guest has one slice, 5 slices are needed.

Q13: 20% of $25 is 0.20 * 25 = $5. The sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which equals 135 minutes. From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is an additional 30 minutes. So, in total, there are 135 + 30 = 165 minutes until 6:30 PM.

Q15: To find out how many taxis are needed for 22 people, divide the total number of people by the capacity of one taxi: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you cannot have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis.

Q16: In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Given two angles are 31 degrees and 62 degrees, their sum is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. The third angle is 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
