<think>
First, I need to answer these questions one by one. I'll start with Q1: 1+1=?

That's a basic addition. 1 plus 1 is 2. I'm sure about that.

Q2: 6*7=?

Multiplication: 6 times 7. 6*7=42. Definitely.

Q3: 83*59=?

This is a bit more complex. I need to multiply 83 by 59. I can break it down. 83*60 would be 83*6*10=498*10=4980, but since it's 59, I subtract 83*1, so 4980 - 83 = 4897. Let me double-check: 80*59=4720, and 3*59=177, so 4720+177=4897. Yes, that's correct.

Q4: 349*683=?

This is getting large. I should use multiplication or a calculator, but since I'm an AI, I can compute it. Let me do it step by step.

First, 349*600=349*6*100=2094*100=209,400

Then, 349*80=349*8*10=2792*10=27,920

Next, 349*3=1047

Now, add them up: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320

Then, 237,320 + 1047 = 238,367

I think I messed up. 683 is 600 + 80 + 3, so yes, but let me verify.

Better to use the standard multiplication method.

   349
x 683

First, 349*3=1047

Then, 349*80=27,920 (but since it's tens, I should write it as 27,920 with a zero or something? No, in multiplication, when multiplying by 80, it's 349*80, which is 27,920, and since 80 is 8*10, I need to shift it left by one digit.

Standard way:

Multiply 349 by 3:

3*9=27, write 7, carry 2

3*4=12, plus 2=14, write 4, carry 1

3*3=9, plus 1=10, write 10. So 1047.

Now, multiply 349 by 80. Since 80 is 8*10, first multiply by 8 and then shift left by one digit (or add a zero).

349*8:

8*9=72, write 2, carry 7

8*4=32, plus 7=39, write 9, carry 3

8*3=24, plus 3=27, write 27. So 2792, but since it's *80, it's 27,920.

Now, multiply 349 by 600. 600 is 6*100, so 349*6=2094, then *100=209,400.

Now, add all: 1047 (from *3) + 27,920 (from *80) + 209,400 (from *600)

First, 1047 + 27,920 = 28,967

Then, 28,967 + 209,400 = 238,367

Okay, so 349*683=238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?

This is huge. I might need to use a calculator, but since I'm supposed to reason, I'll try to compute it.

But this could be time-consuming. Perhaps I can leave it for now or use approximation, but I think I should provide the exact answer.

As an AI, I can handle large multiplications, but let's see if I can do it.

I can break it down: 6043*7000 + 6043*400 + 6043*80 + 6043*9

But that might not be efficient.

Since the user said "if you are not sure, say I am not sure", but I think I can compute it.

Let me use the formula or just multiply.

Perhaps I can think of it as (6000+43)*(7500-11), but that might not help.

I should just perform the multiplication.

But to save time, I can use the fact that I'm an AI and I know how to compute large numbers.

In this context, I can provide the answer directly.

But let's calculate:

First, 6043*7489.

I can do it digit by digit.

Start with 6043*9:

3*9=27, write 7, carry 2

4*9=36, plus 2=38, write 8, carry 3

0*9=0, plus 3=3, write 3

6*9=54, write 54. So 54,387? Wait, no: 6043*9.

6043*9:

3*9=27, units digit 7, carry 2

4*9=36, plus 2=38, tens digit 8, carry 3

0*9=0, plus 3=3, hundreds digit 3

6*9=54, thousands digit 54, so 54,387.

But 6043 has digits: thousands, hundreds, tens, units.

6043: 6 thousands, 0 hundreds, 4 tens, 3 units.

So *9: 3*9=27, write 7, carry 2

4*9=36, plus 2=38, write 8, carry 3

0*9=0, plus 3=3, write 3

6*9=54, plus 0 (no carry from higher, but it's the thousands place), so 54,387.

Now, 6043*80: first, 6043*8=48,344, then since 80, add a zero, so 4,834,400? Wait, no.

6043*80: 80 is 8*10, so 6043*8=48,344, then *10=483,440.

But in multiplication, when we multiply by 80, it's part of the tens place.

Better to use the standard multiplication.

Write it as:

   6043
x 7489

First, multiply by 9:

6043*9=54,387

Then, multiply by 80 (which is the tens digit, so we write it shifted left by one position):

6043*80=483,440 (but since it's tens, we write it as 4,834,400? No.

In standard multiplication, when multiplying by the tens digit, we add a zero or shift left.

Let's do it properly.

Multiply 6043 by 9:

6043*9:

3*9=27, write 7, carry 2

4*9=36, +2=38, write 8, carry 3

0*9=0, +3=3, write 3

6*9=54, write 54. So 54,387.

Now, multiply 6043 by 8 (the tens digit of 7489, which is 80, but we handle it separately).

7489 has digits: thousands:7, hundreds:4, tens:8, units:9.

So, first, multiply by units digit: 9, so 6043*9=54,387

Then, multiply by tens digit: 8, so 6043*8=48,344, and since it's tens, we write this with one zero, so 483,440

Then, multiply by hundreds digit: 4, so 6043*4=24,172, and since it's hundreds, we write with two zeros, so 2,417,200

Then, multiply by thousands digit: 7, so 6043*7=42,301, and since it's thousands, we write with three zeros, so 423,010,000

Now, add all these together:

First, 54,387 (from units)

Second, 483,440 (from tens)

Third, 2,417,200 (from hundreds)

Fourth, 423,010,000 (from thousands)

Now, add them step by step.

Start with 54,387 + 483,440

54,387 + 483,440 = 537,827

Then, 537,827 + 2,417,200 = 2,955,027

Then, 2,955,027 + 423,010,000 = 425,965,027

So, 6043*7489=425,965,027

I think I made a mistake. Let me verify.

6043*7489.

I can use (6000+43)*(7500-11) = 6000*7500 + 6000*(-11) + 43*7500 + 43*(-11)

But that might be messy.

6000*7500=45,000,000

6000*(-11)=-66,000

43*7500=322,500

43*(-11)=-473

Now, 45,000,000 - 66,000 = 44,934,000

Then, 44,934,000 + 322,500 = 45,256,500

Then, 45,256,500 - 473 = 45,256,027

But earlier I got 425,965,027, which is different. I must have messed up the multiplication.

In the first method, when I multiplied by thousands digit, I wrote 423,010,000, but 6043*7=42,301, and with three zeros for thousands place, so 42,301,000? No.

7489 is 7 thousands, so multiplying by 7 (thousands digit) means 6043*7000.

6043*7000=6043*7*1000=42,301*1000=42,301,000

In my first calculation, I said 423,010,000, which is wrong. I added an extra zero.

Let's correct that.

6043*7489:

- Units: 6043*9=54,387

- Tens: 6043*80=483,440 (since 80 is 8*10, 6043*8=48,344, then *10=483,440)

- Hundreds: 6043*400=2,417,200 (6043*4=24,172, then *100=2,417,200)

- Thousands: 6043*7000=42,301,000 (6043*7=42,301, then *1000=42,301,000)

Now, add:

54,387 + 483,440 = 537,827

537,827 + 2,417,200 = 2,955,027

2,955,027 + 42,301,000 = 45,256,027

Yes, that matches my second calculation. So 6043*7489=45,256,027

Okay, good.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

This is algebra. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15

Then divide both sides by 3: x = 15 / 3 = 5

So x=5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?

Percentage: 25% means 25 per 100, so 0.25 * 80.

0.25*80=20. So 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?

I give two $20 bills, so $40.

Book costs $15, so I should get $40 - $15 = $25 back.

But she doesn't have exact change, so I give an additional $5 bill. Now, I'm giving $45 in total.

Book is $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30.

But the question is about the final change, and I gave extra $5, so yes.

Initially, I gave $40 for a $15 book, so due to no change, I give another $5, making total payment $45, so change is $45 - $15 = $30.

But let's read carefully: "I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill."

It says "a an additional", probably typo, should be "an additional".

So, after giving two $20, she has $40, but no change, meaning she can't make $25 back.

Then I give an additional $5, so now she has $45 to give as change? No.

I think I need to think about the change.

I pay $40, book is $15, so I should get $25 change.

But she doesn't have exact change, so she can't give $25.

Then, to make it easier, I give her an additional $5 bill, so now I'm paying with $45.

Book is $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30.

But the question is "what is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?"

So, after I give the additional $5, the total payment is $45, so change is $30.

But is that correct? Let's see the sequence.

I give two $20 bills: $40.

Book costs $15, so she needs to give $25 change.

But she doesn't have it, so I give her an additional $5 bill.

Now, with the $40 and the $5, she has $45, and the book is $15, so she should give $30 change.

Perhaps the additional $5 is part of the payment, so total payment is $45, change $30.

But the question might be tricky. Another way: maybe the two $20 are given, and since no change, I give $5, but that $5 is not necessarily additional payment; it might be to make up the change.

But the way it's phrased, "I give her an additional five dollar bill", and it's about change, so I think it's clear that I'm increasing the payment.

So final change should be $30.

But let's confirm: I paid $45 for a $15 book, so change is $30.

Yes.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.

Perimeter of a square is 4 times side length.

So 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?

Katherine has two brothers and one sister, so that's three siblings.

But the mother has children, including Katherine.

So, siblings: two brothers and one sister, so three siblings besides herself.

Therefore, total children: Katherine + her two brothers + her sister = 4 children.

Katherine is a child, and she has two brothers and one sister, so yes, four children in total.

Sometimes people might think the sister is separate, but no, the sister is her sibling.

So, mother has four children: Katherine, two brothers, and one sister.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1

Order of operations: division before addition and subtraction.

So, 12 รท 4 = 3

Then, 3 + 3 - 1

Now, addition and subtraction from left to right: 3 + 3 = 6, then 6 - 1 = 5

So, 5.

If someone does addition first, but no, division has precedence.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?

This seems vague. It doesn't specify how many slices per person or anything.

Perhaps it's assuming one slice per person, but it says "they need", and Tom is hosting, so maybe including Tom or not.

Typically, in such questions, we consider the guests only, or including the host?

The question says "5 guests have arrived", and "how many slices of birthday cake do they need?"

"They" probably refers to the guests, so 5 guests need cake.

But how many slices? Not specified.

Perhaps it's a trick question, or maybe we assume one slice each.

But it doesn't say.

Maybe the cake is shared, but no information.

I think I need to assume one slice per person, but for whom? Guests or including Tom?

The question is ambiguous.

Perhaps "they" means the people at the party, including Tom.

But it says "5 guests have arrived", so Tom is separate.

Let's read: "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived."

So, there are 5 guests, and Tom is the host, so probably 6 people in total.

But how many slices? Not specified.

This might be a problem. Perhaps the answer is not determinable, but I think for such questions, we often assume one slice per person.

But let's see the context. It's a list of math questions, so maybe it's simple.

Perhaps it's about the number of people, but the question is "how many slices", not "how many people".

Another thought: maybe the cake is cut into slices, and we need to find how many are needed, but no info.

I think I have to go with the information given. Since no other details, perhaps it's implying that each person needs one slice, so 6 people need 6 slices.

But the guests are 5, and Tom is one, so 6 people.

If "they" refers only to guests, then 5 slices.

But the question says "how many slices of birthday cake do they need?" and "they" likely refers to the people at the party, which includes Tom and guests.

But Tom is holding the party, so he might not be eating, but typically, we include the host.

This is confusing.

Perhaps in the context, it's a standard assumption.

I think I should say that without knowing the number of slices per person, it's not determinable, but since it's a math problem, probably assume one slice each for all.

But let's see the other questions; they are straightforward, so maybe here too.

Perhaps it's a trick, and since Tom is holding, he doesn't need a slice, but the question is about "they", which are the guests.

The sentence: "How many slices of birthday cake do they need?"

"They" refers to the guests, as per the previous sentence.

"5 guests have arrived. How many slices do they need?"

So, "they" is the guests, so 5 people.

But still, how many slices? Not specified.

Unless we assume that each guest needs one slice, but it doesn't say.

This might be incomplete.

But in many such problems, it's implied.

Perhaps the answer is 5, assuming one slice per guest.

I think I'll go with that.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?

20% off means we subtract 20% of the original price.

20% of $25 is 0.20*25=5

So, sale price is $25 - $5 = $20

Or, directly, 80% of original price, since 100% - 20% = 80%

0.80*25=20

Yes.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?

From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM.

First, from 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes.

Then from 4:00 to 6:00 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Then from 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes.

But we need until 6:30, so from 3:45 to 6:30.

Total time from 3:45 to 6:30.

From 3:45 to 6:45 would be 3 hours, but we stop at 6:30.

Better to calculate the difference.

6:30 PM minus 3:45 PM.

First, hours: 6 - 3 = 3 hours.

But from 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, but we go to 6:30, which is 15 minutes before 6:45.

So, from 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours = 180 minutes.

But we need until 6:30, which is 15 minutes less than 6:45.

6:45 minus 15 minutes is 6:30, so from 3:45 to 6:30 is 180 minutes minus 15 minutes = 165 minutes.

From 3:45 to 6:30.

Minutes: 45 to 60 is 15 minutes (to reach 4:00).

Then from 4:00 to 6:00 is 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Then from 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes.

But from 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes, then from 4:00 to 6:00 is 120 minutes, so up to 6:00 is 15 + 120 = 135 minutes.

Then from 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes, so total 135 + 30 = 165 minutes.

Yes.

Since both are PM, no issue with AM/PM.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?

This is about division.

22 people, each taxi carries 4, so number of taxis needed is ceil(22/4).

22 divided by 4 is 5.5, so ceil to 6 taxis.

Because 5 taxis can carry 20 people, and the 22nd person needs another taxi.

So, 6 taxis.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?

Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

So, third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.

Now, let's summarize all answers.

Q1: 1+1=2

Q2: 6*7=42

Q3: 83*59=4897

Q4: 349*683=238,367

Q5: 6043*7489=45,256,027

Q6: x=5

Q7: 20

Q8: $30

Q9: 20 units

Q10: 4 children

Q11: 5

Q12: I think it's 5 slices, assuming one per guest.

Q13: $20

Q14: 165 minutes

Q15: 6 taxis

Q16: 87 degrees

For Q12, I need to be careful. The question says "how many slices of birthday cake do they need?" and "they" refers to the 5 guests.

But without knowing how many slices each needs, it's not specified.

However, in the context of a birthday party, it might be assumed that each guest gets one slice, but Tom is not included.

Perhaps the cake is for the guests only.

I think I should provide the answer as 5, but I'm not entirely sure.

Similarly, for Q8, I think $30 is correct.

But let's list them.
