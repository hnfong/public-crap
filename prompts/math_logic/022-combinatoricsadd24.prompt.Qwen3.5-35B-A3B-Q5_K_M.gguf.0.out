Attempt: 8 * 3 * 1 / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * (5 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which matches the set (4, 3, 1, 8). Success.

Final Answer: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 24 [end of text]
