### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**

The number **120** is significant in mathematics and has several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial of 5**:  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $.  
   So, 120 is the factorial of 5.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   120 has many divisors, making it a highly composite number. It has **16 divisors**:  
   $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 $.

3. **Triangular Number**:  
   120 is the **15th triangular number**, meaning it can be represented as the sum of the first 15 natural numbers:  
   $ 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 15 = 120 $.

4. **Tetrahedral Number**:  
   120 is also a **tetrahedral number**, which means it can be represented as the sum of the first 8 triangular numbers.

5. **Used in Time and Angles**:  
   In some contexts, 120 is used in time (e.g., 120 seconds = 2 minutes) and in geometry (e.g., angles in polygons).

6. **Perfect Number?**  
   120 is **not** a perfect number, but it is **abundant**, meaning the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step-by-step solution:**

We are given the quadratic equation:  
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
$$

We can solve this using the **quadratic formula**:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
Where:
- $ a = 1 $
- $ b = -7 $
- $ c = -18 $

**Step 1: Plug in the values into the formula:**
$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)}
$$

**Step 2: Simplify the expression:**
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}
$$
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

**Step 3: Take the square root:**
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

**Step 4: Solve for both values:**
- $ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $
- $ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $

**Final Answer:**
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate the time for one one-way trip.**  
Distance = 200 km  
Speed = 60 km/h  
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 2: Calculate the time for one round trip.**  
One round trip = 2 Ã— one-way trip  
$$
\text{Time for round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 3: Calculate how many round trips can be made in 24 hours.**  
$$
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train can only complete **whole round trips**, we take the **floor** of 3.6.

**Final Answer:**
$$
\text{The train can make 3 full round trips in a day.}
$$

- **Q1:** 120 is the factorial of 5, a highly composite number, a triangular number, and has many divisors.
- **Q2:** The solutions to the equation are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.
- **Q3:** The train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.
