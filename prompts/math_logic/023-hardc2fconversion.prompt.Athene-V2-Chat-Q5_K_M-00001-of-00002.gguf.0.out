Certainly! The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember certain temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit. However, it's important to note that this is not a general rule for all conversions, but rather a specific pattern that occurs at certain intervals.

### Explanation:
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion Formula**: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
- **Pattern**: Every 12°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

### Examples:
1. **12°C**:
   - Convert 12°C to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 53.6 \)
   - The digits of 53.6 are not exactly the reverse of 12, but if we round to the nearest whole number, 54, the digits are reversed (45 is close to 54).

2. **24°C**:
   - Convert 24°C to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 75.2 \)
   - The digits of 75.2 are not exactly the reverse of 24, but if we round to the nearest whole number, 75, the digits are reversed (57 is close to 75).

3. **36°C**:
   - Convert 36°C to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 96.8 \)
   - The digits of 96.8 are not exactly the reverse of 36, but if we round to the nearest whole number, 97, the digits are reversed (63 is close to 97).

### Clarification:
- The pattern is more of a coincidence and works best when rounded to the nearest whole number.
- The exact conversion does not always result in a perfect digit reversal, but it can be a helpful mnemonic for remembering certain key conversions.

### Corrected Statement:
A more accurate way to phrase this mnemonic might be:
"Every 12°C, the Fahrenheit temperature is close to the reverse of the Celsius temperature when rounded to the nearest whole number."

### Summary:
- **12°C ≈ 54°F** (45 is close to 54)
- **24°C ≈ 75°F** (57 is close to 75)
- **36°C ≈ 97°F** (63 is close to 97)

This pattern can help you remember these specific conversions, but it's not a general rule for all Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions. [end of text]
