Alright, let me try to figure out these questions step by step. I have three questions here, so I'll take them one by one.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

Okay, so I need to explain the significance and some interesting properties of the number 120. Hmm. I know 120 is a factorial number. Specifically, 5 factorial is 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. So maybe it's significant because it's a factorial number. Also, 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. It's also the smallest number with 16 divisors? Or maybe not exactly, but it's known for having many factors.

Additionally, 120 is the number of permutations of 5 distinct objects. So it's related to permutations and combinations. It's also the sum of the first 11 natural numbers: 1+2+3+...+11? Wait, let me calculate: 1+2=3, +3=6, +4=10, +5=15, +6=21, +7=28, +8=36, +9=45, +10=55, +11=66. No, that's not 120. Maybe another formula? Or perhaps it's 5 factorial.

Also, 120 is the smallest number divisible by numbers 1 through 5. So it's a highly composite number. It's also the number of minutes in 2 hours? No, 2 hours is 120 minutes? Wait, 60 minutes in an hour, so 2*60=120. So yes, 120 minutes is 2 hours. So that's another property.

So perhaps the significance includes it being a factorial number, highly composite, relates to time (120 minutes), and also in geometry maybe?

Interesting properties: 120 is the smallest number divisible by 1 through 5, it's the sum of the first 11 natural numbers? Wait, 1+2+...+11 is 66. Not 120. Maybe 1+2+...+15 is 120? Let me calculate: n(n+1)/2. So n=15: 15*16/2=120. Yes! So 15*16/2=120. So 120 is the 15th triangular number. So that's another interesting property.

Also, 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 objects in order, which is 5! So that's a factorial property.

So perhaps I can list these properties:

- 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 120)
- It is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: 1+2+...+15=120
- It is the number of permutations of 5 distinct objects
- It is the number of minutes in 2 hours
- It is the smallest number divisible by 1 through 5
- It is the 15th triangular number
- It has a lot of divisors, making it highly composite

I think that covers some interesting properties.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

Alright, quadratic equation. Let me solve for x.

The equation is x² -7x -18 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2

Because discriminant D = b² -4ac. Here a=1, b=-7, c=-18.

So D = (-7)² -4*1*(-18) = 49 +72= 121

So sqrt(121)=11

Thus x = [7 ±11]/2

So two solutions:

First solution: (7 +11)/2=18/2=9

Second solution: (7 -11)/2= (-4)/2= -2

So solutions are x=9 and x=-2

Let me verify:

Plug x=9: 81 - 63 -18= 81-81=0. Correct.

Plug x=-2: 4 +14 -18= 18-18=0. Correct.

So yes, solutions are 9 and -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Alright, let's parse this.

The train travels between two cities 200 km apart at 60 km/h. Time for one way?

First, one way distance is 200 km.

Time taken for one way: distance/speed = 200 /60 hours.

Simplify: 200/60 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 hours.

So one way is 10/3 hours.

A round trip would be going and coming back, so 2*(10/3) = 20/3 hours per round trip.

Now, how many round trips can it make in a full day?

A full day is 24 hours.

So number of round trips = total time available / time per round trip

So 24 / (20/3) = 24 * (3/20) = (24*3)/20 = 72/20 = 3.6

But since you can't make a fraction of a round trip, so it can make 3 complete round trips.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait the question says "how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?"

So each round trip is going and coming back, so yes, 200 km each way.

So time per round trip: 2*(200/60) = 400/60 = 20/3 hours ≈6.666 hours.

So total time available is 24 hours.

Number of round trips = 24 / (20/3) = 24 * (3/20) = (24*3)/20 = 72/20= 3.6

So since you can't have 0.6 of a round trip, it's 3 complete round trips.

But wait, let me confirm:

Time per round trip: going from A to B is 200/60 hours, and coming back is another 200/60. So total 2*(200/60)= 400/60= 20/3 ≈6.6667 hours.

So in 24 hours, number of round trips is 24 / (20/3) = 24*(3/20)= (24*3)/20=72/20=3.6

So since you can't have a fraction of a trip, it's 3 round trips.

But wait another thing: Maybe the question is about how many round trips can be made in a day, considering each round trip is one round? So perhaps it's 3.

But let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the train goes from city A to B and back as a round trip. So each round trip is 200*2=400 km? Wait no, the distance between two cities is 200 km. So one way is 200 km. So round trip is 200*2=400 km? But the speed is given as 60 km/h. So time per round trip is 400 /60 hours.

Wait wait, perhaps I misread the question.

The question says: "A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?"

So "round trips" between the two cities. So a round trip is going from city A to B and back to A. So distance is 200*2=400 km.

So time per round trip is 400 /60 hours.

So time per round trip: 400 /60 = 20/3 ≈6.6667 hours
