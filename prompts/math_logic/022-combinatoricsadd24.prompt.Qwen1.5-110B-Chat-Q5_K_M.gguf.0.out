Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 * 1) + 4 = 4 * 3 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 - 3) + 1 * 4 = 8 * 1 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 / 4) * (3 + 1) + 1 = 2 * 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 + (4 * 3) - 1 = 8 + 12 - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4) / (3 - 1) * 1 = 12 / 2 * 1 = 6 * 1 = 6, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) / 4 = 8 * 4 / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (4 * 8) - (3 * 1) = 32 - 3 = 29, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (4 * (8 - 1)) - 3 = (4 * 7) - 3 = 28 - 3 = 25, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - (4 / 1)) * 3 = (8 - 4) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 - ((3 - 4) * 1) + 3 = 8 - (-1) * 1 + 3 = 8 + 1 + 3 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (4 * 3) + (8 - 1) = 12 + 7 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: ((8 - 4) * 3) + 1 = (4 * 3) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 * (8 - 2) = 4 * 6 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
