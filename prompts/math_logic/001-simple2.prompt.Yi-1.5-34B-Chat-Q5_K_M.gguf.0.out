Q1: The significance of the number 120 and some of its interesting properties:

120 is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any number less than it. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

120 is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61).

It is also the product of the first four prime numbers (2 x 3 x 5 x 7), making it a primorial.

120 is the smallest number that is the sum of six consecutive primes (11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29).

In Roman numerals, 120 is represented as CXX, and it has historical significance in various contexts, such as being a round number used in measurements and medieval currency exchange rates.

In measurement, 120 can refer to inches in feet (10 feet), degrees in a circle (60 degrees), and other traditional measurements.

In sports, 120 can symbolize a high achievement, such as a 120-stroke performance in golf indicating a very good game.

In video games, level 120 often represents a high level that requires significant effort to achieve.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula, where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. The quadratic formula is given by:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

Plugging in the values, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))] / 2(1)
x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
x = [7 ± 11] / 2

This gives us two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible; how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To find out how many round trips the train can make, we first calculate the time it takes to make one trip from one city to the other. The formula to calculate time is:

Time = Distance / Speed

For one trip, the time taken is:

Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.333 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes)

For a round trip, the train has to travel the distance twice, so the total time for a round trip is:

Total Time = 2 * 3.333 hours = 6.666 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes)

A full day has 24 hours. To find out how many round trips the train can make, we divide the total available hours by the time taken for one round trip:

Number of Round Trips = 24 hours / 6.666 hours per round trip ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day, given that the time it spends stationed in the cities is negligible.<|im_end|>
