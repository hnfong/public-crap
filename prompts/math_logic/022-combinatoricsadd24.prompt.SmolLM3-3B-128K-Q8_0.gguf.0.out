Let's try again:

Attempt: 4 * (8 - (3 + 1)) = 4 * (8 - 4) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.

So, the correct expression is: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24 [end of text]
