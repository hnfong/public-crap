We are asked: "Give the answer for these questions. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ...""

We have 16 questions. Let's list them:

Q1: 1+1=?
Answer: 2.

Q2: 6*7=?
Answer: 42.

Q3: 83*59=?
We need to compute 83*59. Let's compute: 83*59 = 83*60 - 83 = 4980 - 83 = 4897. Wait check: 83*60 = 4980, subtract 83 gives 4897. So answer: 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?
We need to compute 349*683. Let's compute: 349*683 = 349*600 + 349*83. Let's compute: 349*600 = 209400, then 349*83 = 349*80 + 349*3 = 27920 + 1047 = 28967. Sum: 209400 + 28967 = 238367. Wait check: 209400 + 28967 = 238367. Alternatively, we can do multiplication: 683*349 = 683*300 + 683*49 = 204900 + 33467 = 238367. Yes. So answer: 238367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
We need to compute 6043*7489. Let's compute: 6043*7489 = 6043*7000 + 6043*489. Let's compute: 6043*7000 = 42,301,000? Wait recalc: 6043*7000 = 6043*7*1000 = 42,301*1000? Let's recalc: 6043*7 = 42,301, then times 1000 equals 42,301,000. Then 6043*489 = 6043*500 - 6043*11 = 3,021,500 - 66,473 = 2,955,027. Wait check: 6043*500 = 3,021,500, 6043*11 = 66,473, so difference = 2,955,027. Then sum: 42,301,000 + 2,955,027 = 45,256,027. Let's check: 42,301,000 + 2,955,027 = 45,256,027. Alternatively, we can do: 6043*7489 = 6043*7500 - 6043*11 = 45,322,500 - 66,473 = 45,256,027. Yes. So answer: 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
Solve: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15, so x = 15/3 = 5. So answer: x = 5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% of 80 = 0.25*80 = 20. So answer: 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
Let's parse: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. Wait, what's the scenario? Possibly the scenario is: I pay with two $20 bills, but the shopkeeper doesn't have change, so I give an extra $5 bill to help her make change? Let's re-read: "I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?" Let's analyze: I gave two $20 bills, that's $40, plus an additional $5 bill, that's $45 total given. The cost is $15, so the change should be $45 - $15 = $30. But wait, the wording "but she does not have exact change" might be a trick. Let me re-read: "I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill." Possibly the scenario is: I intended to pay with two $20 bills, but she doesn't have change, so I give her an extra $5 bill to help her break the $20 bills? But then the final change is computed as: I gave $45, cost is $15, so change is $30. But wait, maybe the trick is: The shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so she gives me change in a different form? Let's re-read: "I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?" Possibly the answer is $30. But let me check: If I gave two $20 bills, that's $40, but she doesn't have change, so I give her an extra $5 bill to help her break the $20 bills? But then the total amount I gave is $45, so the change is $45 - $15 = $30. But wait, maybe the trick is: The shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so she gives me change in a different form? Let me re-read the question carefully: "I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?" Possibly the answer is $30. But wait, maybe the trick is: The shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so she gives me change in a different form? Let me re-read: "I give her an additional five dollar bill." That means I gave her $20 + $20 + $5 = $45. The cost is $15, so the change is $45 - $15 = $30. So answer: $30.

However, let me check if there's any trick: Possibly the trick is that the shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so she gives me change in a different form. But the question is: "What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?" It is $30. So answer: $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter = 4 * side = 4*5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine has two brothers and a sister. That means Katherine is one child, plus two brothers and one sister equals 1+2+1 = 4 children. But wait, check: "Katherine has two brothers and a sister." That means she has three siblings. But the question "How many children does her mother have?" might be ambiguous: It might be 4 children if Katherine is included. But sometimes people might think that Katherine's mother has 3 children. But careful: "Katherine has two brothers and a sister" means she has three siblings. But the question "How many children does her mother have?" includes Katherine as well. So
