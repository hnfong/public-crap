Okay, so I need to figure out what this statement means and provide an example. The statement says: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. I know the formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. But the statement is about a shortcut. It mentions Celsius to Fahrenheit and suggests that every 12°C, the digits are inverted. So maybe it's a rule of thumb or approximation?

Let me think. If every 12°C, digits are inverted. So perhaps when converting 12°C to Fahrenheit, it becomes 52°F? Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me check.

Wait, 12°C to Fahrenheit: Using the formula, F = (12 * 9/5) + 32. So 12 * 9/5 is 12*1.8=21.6, plus 32 is 53.6°F. So approximately 54°F. So maybe the statement is suggesting that the digits are inverted? So 12 becomes 21? But 12 is two digits, 1 and 2. Inverting digits would be 21? But 12°C is 54°F, not 21. So maybe not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about reversing the digits when converting. So for example, if you have a temperature like 12°C, converting to Fahrenheit gives 54°F, which is 5 and 4. So maybe reversing 1 and 2 gives 21? But 21°C is something else. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about adding 12 to Celsius and then reversing? Or subtracting?

Wait another approach: Maybe the statement is suggesting that adding 12 to Celsius gives a Fahrenheit where digits are inverted. Let me see.

For example, if Celsius is 10°C, then Fahrenheit is (10*9/5)+32= 18 +32=50°F. So 10°C is 50°F. Now, 10 and 50: digits reversed? 10 becomes 01 or 1? Not exactly. Or perhaps 10 becomes 50, which is 5 and 0, but 10 is 1 and 0. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the statement says every 12°C, digits are inverted. So for example, 12°C would be converted to Fahrenheit and the digits are inverted. So 12°C to F is 54°F, which is 54. So digits are 5 and 4. Inverting 12's digits (1 and 2) would be 21. But 21°F is not 54. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that when Celsius is a two-digit number, like XY, then Fahrenheit is YX. So for example, 12°C is 54°F, but 12 reversed is 21, which isn't 54. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps every time you add 12 to Celsius, the Fahrenheit digits are inverted. Let me test.

Take Celsius = 12: 12°C to F is 54°F. Now, 12 +12=24°C. 24°C to F is (24*9/5)+32=43.2 +32=75.2°F. Now, 24 reversed is 42. 75 is not 42. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps every 12°C, the Fahrenheit is the reverse of Celsius's digits. So 12°C is 54°F. 12 reversed is 21, but 54 isn't 21. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every time you add 12°C, the Fahrenheit temperature is the reverse of Celsius. So 12°C is 54°F. Now, 54°F converted back to Celsius is (54-32)*5/9= 22*5/9≈12.22°C. So 12°C converts to 54°F, and 54°F converts back to approximately 12°C. So perhaps every 12°C, the Fahrenheit is 54, which is 12 + 42? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps every 12 degrees Celsius, the Fahrenheit is 54? So 12°C is 54°F. Then 24°C is 75.2°F, which is not 66 or anything. So maybe not.

The statement says "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." So perhaps if Celsius is a two-digit number, like AB, then Fahrenheit is BA? Let me test.

Take 12°C: AB=12. So Fahrenheit would be 21°F? But 12°C is 54°F. So 21≠54. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the digits are reversed in the number when converted. So 12°C becomes 21°F? But 12°C is 54°F. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the digits are swapped in the number when converting. So 12°C is 21°F? But 12°C is 54°F. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is a rule of thumb where you invert the digits when adding or subtracting 12. So for example, if you have a temperature in Celsius, adding 12 gives a Fahrenheit where digits are inverted.

So for example, Celsius is 10°C: 10 +12=22°C? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Celsius is 12, Fahrenheit is 54. So 12 and 54: 12 reversed is 21, but 54 is not 21. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every time you add 12 to Celsius, the Fahrenheit is the reverse of the original number. So 12°C → 54°F. Now, 12 reversed is 21. 54 reversed is 45. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every 12°C increase, the Fahrenheit increase is 18°F? Because 12°C increase is 12*1.8=21.6°F increase. So not exactly 12, but close.

But the statement says "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." So perhaps when Celsius is 12, Fahrenheit is 21? But 12°C is 54°F. So 54 is not 21. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every time you add 12 to Celsius, the digits are inverted. So 12°C → 54°F. Now, 12 reversed is 21. 54 reversed is 45. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every 10°C, the digits are inverted? But the statement says 12.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a rule where you invert the digits when converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit when the temperature is between certain ranges. For example, temperatures between 0-32°F correspond to -17.78°C to 0°C. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simplified way to remember: for every 10°C increase, add 18°F. So 10°C is 50°F. So digits inverted? 10 becomes 01 or 1? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every time you have a two-digit Celsius number, you invert the digits when converting to Fahrenheit. So for example, 12°C is 54°F. So 12 becomes 21? But 21°F is not 54. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every 12°C, the digits are inverted in the Fahrenheit temperature. So 12°C is 54°F. So 12 and 54: 12 reversed is 21, which is not 54. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every time you add 12 to Celsius, the Fahrenheit is the previous digits reversed. So 12 +12=24°C → 24*9/5 +32=43.2 +32=75.2°F. Now, 24 reversed is 42. 75.2 reversed digits? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every 12°C, the digits in Fahrenheit are the reverse of Celsius. So 12°C is 54°F. So 12 reversed is 21, but 54≠21. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is that every 12°F, the digits are inverted. So 12°F is 5°C? Let me check: 12°F to C is (12-32)*5/9= (-20)*5/9≈-11.11°C. So not
