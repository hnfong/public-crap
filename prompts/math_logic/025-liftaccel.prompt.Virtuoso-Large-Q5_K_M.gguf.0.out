Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

1. **Total Distance:**
   - The building has 40 floors, and each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - Total distance \( d \) from the ground floor to the top floor:
     \[
     d = 40 \times 5 = 200 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Maximum Speed and Acceleration:**
   - Maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \text{ m/s} \)
   - Acceleration \( a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \)

3. **Time to Reach Maximum Speed:**
   - Time \( t_1 \) to reach maximum speed:
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Distance Covered During Acceleration:**
   - Distance \( d_1 \) covered during acceleration:
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Distance Covered During Deceleration:**
   - The deceleration phase is symmetrical to the acceleration phase, so the distance \( d_2 \) covered during deceleration is also:
     \[
     d_2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

6. **Distance Covered at Maximum Speed:**
   - Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration:
     \[
     d_1 + d_2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} + 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Distance \( d_3 \) covered at maximum speed:
     \[
     d_3 = d - (d_1 + d_2) = 200 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters}
     \]

7. **Time to Cover Distance at Maximum Speed:**
   - Time \( t_3 \) to cover \( d_3 \) at maximum speed:
     \[
     t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

8. **Total Time:**
   - Total time \( t \) to travel from the ground floor to the top floor:
     \[
     t = t_1 + t_3 + t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds} + 35 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 45 \text{ seconds}
     \]

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **Distance to 10/F:**
   - Distance \( d_1 \) to 10/F:
     \[
     d_1 = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Time to Reach 10/F:**
   - Time \( t_1 \) to reach 10/F:
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{50 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 10 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Distance from 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Distance \( d_2 \) from 10/F to 30/F:
     \[
     d_2 = (30 - 10) \times 5 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Time to Reach 30/F from 10/F:**
   - Time \( t_2 \) to reach 30/F from 10/F:
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{100 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total time \( t \) to reach 30/F:
     \[
     t = t_1 + t_2 = 10 \text{ seconds} + 20 \text{ seconds} = 30 \text{ seconds}
     \]

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **Minimum Time to Stop at Another Floor:**
   - The lift must decelerate to a stop at the intermediate floor and then accelerate again to reach 40/F.
   - Let's assume the intermediate floor is 20/F (the middle floor).

2. **Distance to 20/F:**
   - Distance \( d_1 \) to 20/F:
     \[
     d_1 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Time to Reach 20/F:**
   - Time \( t_1 \) to reach 20/F:
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{100 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Time to Stop at 20/F:**
   - Time \( t_{\text{stop}} \) to decelerate to a stop:
     \[
     t_{\text{stop}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Distance from 20/F to 40/F:**
   - Distance \( d_2 \) from 20/F to 40/F:
     \[
     d_2 = (40 - 20) \times 5 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters}
     \]

6. **Time to Reach 40/F from 20/F:**
   - Time \( t_2 \) to reach 40/F from 20/F:
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{100 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
     \]

7. **Total Time:**
   - Total time \( t \) to reach 40/F with a stop at 20/F:
     \[
     t = t_1 + t_{\text{stop}} + t_2 = 20 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} + 20 \text{ seconds} = 45 \text{ seconds}
     \]

However, this is the same as the time calculated in Question 1, which is the minimum time without any stops. To find the minimum time with a stop, we need to consider the additional time for deceleration and acceleration at the intermediate floor.

- Additional time for deceleration and acceleration at the intermediate floor:
  \[
  t_{\text{additional}} = 2 \times t_{\text{stop}} = 2 \times 5 \
