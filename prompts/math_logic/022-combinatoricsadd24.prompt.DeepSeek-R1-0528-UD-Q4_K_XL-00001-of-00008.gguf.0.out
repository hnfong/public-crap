I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once each to make 24. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. Let me start trying different combinations.

First attempt: I know 8 times 3 is 24, but I have to use all four numbers. So maybe I can do something like (8 * 3) * (something with 4 and 1 that equals 1), but 4 and 1, if I do 4/1, that's 4, not 1. Or 1/4 is 0.25, which might not help. Let me think.

What if I do 8 * (4 - 1) * something, but 4-1 is 3, and 8*3 is 24, but I still have the 3 left? No, I used 4 and 1 for (4-1), and 8, but I have a 3 that I haven't used. The numbers are 4,3,1,8, so if I use 4 and 1 in (4-1), that's 3, then I have 8 and the original 3. So (4-1) is 3, and I have another 3, so 8 * 3 * 1, but I used 1 already? No, in (4-1), I used 4 and 1, so I have 3 and 8 left. So 8 * 3 * (4-1)? But (4-1) is 3, so 8*3*3=72, too big. Or 8*3 + something, but I need to use the 1.

Perhaps division. Like 8 / (1/3) or something. 1/3 is about 0.333, 8 divided by that is 24. Oh, that could work. But I have to use 4 as well. So maybe incorporate the 4.

Let me write it: 8 / (1/3) = 8 * 3 = 24, but I didn't use 4. So I need to use 4 in a way that doesn't change the value, like multiplying by 4/4 or something. But 4/4 is 1, so I can multiply by that.

So, [8 / (1/3)] * (4/4) = 24 * 1 = 24. But I used 1 twice? No: in 1/3, I used one 1, and in 4/4, I used two 4s? Let's see the numbers: I have 8, 1, 3, and 4. In [8 / (1/3)] * (4/4), I used 8, 1, 3, and then two 4s? 4/4 uses two 4s, but I only have one 4. Mistake.

I have only one 4. So I can't do 4/4. I need to use each number exactly once.

Perhaps (8 * 3) * (4 / 4) but again, 4/4 uses two 4s.

No, 4/4 is one expression using one 4 twice? No, in terms of numbers, 4/4 uses the number 4 two times. But I have only one 4 to use. So I need to use each of the four numbers: 4,3,1,8 exactly once.

So I can't use a number more than once.

Therefore, expressions like 4/4 are invalid because they use 4 twice.

Similarly, I can't do (8*3) *1, but that only uses three numbers, missing the 4.

So I need all four.

Another idea:  (8 - 4) * (3 * 2), but I don't have 2, I have 1. 3*1 is 3, not helpful.

(8 + 4) * something. 8+4=12, then 12 * 2 =24, but I have 3 and 1, 3-1=2, so (8+4) * (3-1) = 12 * 2 = 24.

Let me check: numbers used: 8,4,3,1. Perfect.

Expression: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1)

Compute: 8+4=12, 3-1=2, 12*2=24. Yes!

But let me double-check the format.

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 8,4,3,1. All present.

In the double-checking, I should show the calculation step by step as in the example.

In the example, they did: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is wrong.

So for this, it should be fine.

But let me write it properly.

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 4,3,1,8. Correct.

In the numbers used, it should be (4,3,1,8) as given.

In the expression, I used 8,4,3,1, which are the same numbers.

So this should work.

But in the initial problem, it says "construct a mathematical expression" and "result is 24", and I think this is correct.

But let me see if there are other ways, but this seems fine.

Perhaps I should confirm if subtraction and addition are allowed, which they are.

Another common way is to use multiplication and division.

For example, 8 * 3 = 24, and then multiply by 1 and add 0 or something, but I have to use 4.

(8 * 3) * (4 / 4) but again, 4/4 uses two 4s.

No, can't.

8 * (3 + 1) * something, 3+1=4, 8*4=32, too big, and I have 4 left? 32 divided by 4/3 or something messy.

Not necessary since I have a solution.

But in my solution, I used (3-1) which is subtraction, and (8+4) addition, and multiplication, all fine.

Perhaps division:  (8 / (1/3)) * something with 4.

8 / (1/3) = 8 * 3/1 = 24, but again, missing 4.

To include 4, I could do [8 / (1/3)] * (4/4) but again, two 4s.

No.

(6 * 4) = 24, but I don't have 6, I have 8,3,1. 8-2=6, but no 2.

(8 - 2) * 4, but no 2.

With 3 and 1, 3-1=2, so (8 - (3-1)) * something.

(8 - (3-1)) = (8 - 2) = 6, then 6 * 4 = 24, but I used 8,3,1,4, all numbers.

Expression: (8 - (3 - 1)) * 4

Compute: 3-1=2, 8-2=6, 6*4=24.

Numbers used: 8,3,1,4.

Same as before, just different order.

In terms of expression, it's fine.

But in this case, I have multiplication and subtraction.

In the first one, I had addition and subtraction.

Both work.

But let me write the first one as per the format.

In the double-checking, I need to show the calculation.

Also, in the example, they had a mistake and retried.

But I think mine is correct.

Perhaps I should write it as per the instruction.

So:

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 4,3,1,8. Correct.

But in the double checking, it says "which is not 24" if wrong, but here it is 24, so no need for retrying.

In the format, it should be fine.

To be thorough, let's see if there's an expression with division.

For example,  (4 * 8) / (1) * 3 / 1 or something, messy.

(4 * 6) = 24, but no 6.

8 * 3 = 24, same.

(48) / 2, but 48 from 4 and 8? 4*8=32, not 48.

(3 * 8) * (1) + 0, but no 0.

I think addition and subtraction is fine.

Another one: 4 * (3 + 3) but I have only one 3.

No.

8 / 1 * 3, but 24, missing 4.

(8 * 3 * 1) * (4/4) invalid.

So I think (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) is correct.

Perhaps exponentiation, but I think we stick to basic operations.

The problem says "mathematical expression" with operations, probably basic arithmetic.

So I think it's fine.

In the initial example, they had a mistake with numbers used, like using 4 twice.

In my case, all good.

So I should present it.
</think>
After several attempts, I found a valid expression that uses the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once to equal 24.

**Attempt:** (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
**Double checking:** (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8), which is correct.  
**Result:** 24, success.

This expression is correct and uses each number exactly once. [end of text]
