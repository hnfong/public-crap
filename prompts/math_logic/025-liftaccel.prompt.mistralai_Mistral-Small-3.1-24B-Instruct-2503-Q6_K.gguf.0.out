Let's solve each question step by step.

### 1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

First, we need to calculate the total distance the elevator travels:
- The building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall.
- Total distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The elevator's motion can be divided into three phases:
1. Acceleration phase
2. Constant speed phase
3. Deceleration phase

Let's denote:
- \( a \) = acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/sÂ²
- \( v \) = maximum speed = 5 m/s
- \( s \) = total distance = 200 meters

#### Acceleration Phase:
The distance covered during acceleration (\( s_a \)) can be found using the kinematic equation:
\[ s_a = \frac{v^2}{2a} \]
\[ s_a = \frac{5^2}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

#### Deceleration Phase:
The distance covered during deceleration (\( s_d \)) is the same as during acceleration:
\[ s_d = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

#### Constant Speed Phase:
The remaining distance covered at constant speed (\( s_c \)) is:
\[ s_c = s - (s_a + s_d) = 200 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 200 - 25 = 175 \text{ meters} \]

#### Time Calculation:
- Time to accelerate to maximum speed (\( t_a \)):
\[ v = at_a \]
\[ t_a = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to decelerate from maximum speed (\( t_d \)):
\[ t_d = t_a = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to travel at constant speed (\( t_c \)):
\[ t_c = \frac{s_c}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Total time (\( t \)) to travel from the ground floor to the top floor:
\[ t = t_a + t_c + t_d = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

### 2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

First, calculate the distances:
- Distance to 10/F: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters} \)
- Distance to 30/F: \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \text{ meters} \)

The elevator will first travel to 10/F and then to 30/F.

#### To 10/F:
- Acceleration phase distance: \( s_a = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
- Remaining distance at constant speed: \( s_c = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \text{ meters} \)

- Time to accelerate (\( t_a \)): \( 5 \text{ seconds} \)
- Time to travel at constant speed (\( t_c \)): \( \frac{37.5}{5} = 7.5 \text{ seconds} \)

Total time to 10/F:
\[ t_{10} = t_a + t_c = 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 \text{ seconds} \]

#### From 10/F to 30/F:
- Distance: \( 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ meters} \)

- Acceleration phase distance: \( s_a = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
- Remaining distance at constant speed: \( s_c = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \text{ meters} \)

- Time to accelerate (\( t_a \)): \( 5 \text{ seconds} \)
- Time to travel at constant speed (\( t_c \)): \( \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \text{ seconds} \)

Total time from 10/F to 30/F:
\[ t_{30} = t_a + t_c = 5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \text{ seconds} \]

Total time from the ground floor to 30/F:
\[ t_{total} = t_{10} + t_{30} = 12.5 + 22.5 = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

### 3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the ground floor. Let's assume the second person goes to the 2/F (the closest floor to the ground floor).

#### To 2/F:
- Distance to 2/F: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ meters} \)

- Acceleration phase distance: \( s_a = 10 \text{ meters} \) (since \( s_a \leq 10 \))
- Remaining distance at constant speed: \( s_c = 0 \text{ meters} \)

- Time to accelerate (\( t_a \)): \( \sqrt{\frac{2s_a}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10}{1}} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47 \text{ seconds} \)

Total time to 2/F:
\[ t_{2} = t_a = 4.47 \text{ seconds} \]

#### From 2/F to 40/F:
- Distance: \( 200 - 10 = 190 \text{ meters} \)

- Acceleration phase distance: \( s_a = 12.5 \text{ meters} \)
- Remaining distance at constant speed: \( s_c = 190 - 12.5 = 177.5 \text{ meters} \)

- Time to accelerate (\( t_a \)): \( 5 \text{ seconds} \)
- Time to travel at constant speed (\( t_c \)): \( \frac{177.5}{5} = 35.5 \text{ seconds} \)

Total time from 2/F to 40/F:
\[ t_{40} = t_a + t_c = 5 + 35.5 = 40.5 \text{ seconds} \]

Total time from the ground floor to 40/F with a stop at 2/F:
\[ t_{total} = t_{2} + t_{40} = 4.47 + 40.5 = 44.97 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is approximately 44.97 seconds. [end of text]
