Let's solve each question step by step.

### 1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by the lift.**

The building has 40 floors, and each floor is 5 meters tall. Therefore, the total height the lift needs to travel is:
\[ \text{Total height} = 40 \times 5 = 200 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 2: Determine the phases of motion.**

The lift will accelerate from rest to its maximum speed, travel at that speed, and then decelerate to rest.

Let:
- \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration/deceleration)
- \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) (maximum speed)

**Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration.**

The distance covered during acceleration (\( s_a \)) and deceleration (\( s_d \)) can be calculated using the kinematic equation:
\[ s = \frac{v^2}{2a} \]

For acceleration:
\[ s_a = \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{2a} = \frac{5^2}{2 \times 1} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

For deceleration:
\[ s_d = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the distance covered at maximum speed.**

The total distance covered at maximum speed (\( s_v \)) is:
\[ s_v = \text{Total height} - (s_a + s_d) = 200 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 200 - 25 = 175 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the time taken for each phase.**

- Time to accelerate to maximum speed (\( t_a \)):
\[ t_a = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to decelerate from maximum speed (\( t_d \)):
\[ t_d = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to travel at maximum speed (\( t_v \)):
\[ t_v = \frac{s_v}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total time.**

The total time (\( t_{\text{total}} \)) is the sum of the times for each phase:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_a + t_v + t_d = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it takes **45 seconds** for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### 2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Step 1: Calculate the distance to the 10th floor.**

The 10th floor is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance to the 30th floor.**

The 30th floor is:
\[ 30 \times 5 = 150 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the phases of motion to the 10th floor.**

- Distance covered during acceleration (\( s_a \)) and deceleration (\( s_d \)) remains the same: 12.5 meters each.
- Distance covered at maximum speed (\( s_v \)) to the 10th floor:
\[ s_v = 50 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the time taken for each phase to the 10th floor.**

- Time to accelerate to maximum speed (\( t_a \)):
\[ t_a = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to decelerate from maximum speed (\( t_d \)):
\[ t_d = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to travel at maximum speed (\( t_v \)) to the 10th floor:
\[ t_v = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total time to the 10th floor.**

The total time (\( t_{\text{total}} \)) to the 10th floor is:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_a + t_v + t_d = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 6: Determine the phases of motion from the 10th floor to the 30th floor.**

- Distance covered at maximum speed (\( s_v \)) from the 10th to the 30th floor:
\[ s_v = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 7: Calculate the time taken for each phase from the 10th to the 30th floor.**

- Time to travel at maximum speed (\( t_v \)) from the 10th to the 30th floor:
\[ t_v = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 8: Calculate the total time from the 10th to the 30th floor.**

The total time (\( t_{\text{total}} \)) from the 10th to the 30th floor is:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_v = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 9: Calculate the total time for both trips.**

The total time for both trips is:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = 15 + 20 = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it takes **35 seconds** for the lift to go from the ground floor to the 10th floor and then to the 30th floor.

### 3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Step 1: Determine the optimal stopping floor.**

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at a floor that is as close as possible to the midpoint between the ground floor and the 40th floor. The midpoint is at the 20th floor.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance to the 20th floor.**

The 20th floor is:
\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the distance from the 20th floor to the 40th floor.**

The distance from the 20th to the 40th floor is:
\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 4: Determine the phases of motion to the 20th floor.**

- Distance covered during acceleration (\( s_a \)) and deceleration (\( s_d \)) remains the same: 12.5 meters each.
- Distance covered at maximum speed (\( s_v \)) to the 20th floor:
\[ s_v = 100 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 100 - 25 = 75 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the time taken for each phase to the 20th floor.**

- Time to accelerate to maximum speed (\( t_a \)):
\[ t_a = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to decelerate from maximum speed (\( t_d \)):
\[ t_d = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

- Time to travel at maximum speed (\( t_v \)) to the 20th floor:
\[ t_v = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total time to the 20th floor.**

The total time (\( t_{\text{total}} \)) to
