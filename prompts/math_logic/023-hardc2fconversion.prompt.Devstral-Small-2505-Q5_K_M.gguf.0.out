The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. Let's break it down with examples.

### Explanation:
1. **Every 12°C**: This means we are looking at intervals of 12 degrees Celsius.
2. **The digits are inverted**: This suggests that if you take a temperature in Celsius, multiply it by 2, and then invert the digits, you will get a rough approximation of the temperature in Fahrenheit.

### Examples:
Let's use a few examples to illustrate this:

1. **0°C**:
   - Multiply by 2: 0 * 2 = 0
   - Invert the digits: 0 (remains the same)
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 32°F (actual Fahrenheit is 32°F)

2. **12°C**:
   - Multiply by 2: 12 * 2 = 24
   - Invert the digits: 24 becomes 42
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 54°F (actual Fahrenheit is 53.6°F)

3. **24°C**:
   - Multiply by 2: 24 * 2 = 48
   - Invert the digits: 48 becomes 84
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 84°F (actual Fahrenheit is 75.2°F)

4. **36°C**:
   - Multiply by 2: 36 * 2 = 72
   - Invert the digits: 72 becomes 27
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 97°F (actual Fahrenheit is 96.8°F)

### Important Notes:
- This method is a rough approximation and not exact.
- The actual formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \).
- The mnemonic helps with quick, approximate conversions, which can be useful in everyday situations where precise values are not critical.

By using this mnemonic, you can quickly estimate Fahrenheit temperatures from Celsius without needing to do the full calculation. [end of text]
