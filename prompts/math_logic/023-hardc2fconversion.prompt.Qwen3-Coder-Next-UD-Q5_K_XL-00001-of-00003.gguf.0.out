Let’s carefully analyze the claim:

> **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."**

At first glance, this sounds like a mnemonic or pattern for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit — specifically, that when the Celsius temperature increases by 12°, the Fahrenheit temperature’s *digits are inverted* (e.g., 21°F ↔ 12°F, or 32°F ↔ 23°F, etc.).

But is this true? Let’s test it.

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Recall the exact conversion formula

\[
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
\]

We’ll compute some Celsius values and see if adding 12°C ever leads to digit inversion in Fahrenheit.

---

### 🔢 Try concrete examples

| °C | °F = (9/5)C + 32 | Inverted digits? |
|----|------------------|------------------|
| 0  | 32               | —                |
| 12 | (9/5)(12) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = **53.6** | 32 → 53.6? Not inverted. |
| 24 | (9/5)(24) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = **75.2** | 53.6 → 75.2? Not inverted. |
| 36 | (9/5)(36) + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = **96.8** | Still no digit inversion. |

What if we look for *any* pair where Fahrenheit values are digit reverses?

Let’s search for integer °F values that are digit reverses (e.g., 12 ↔ 21, 13 ↔ 31, 14 ↔ 41, etc.), and see if their corresponding °C values differ by 12.

#### Example 1: 21°F and 12°F

- 21°F → \( C = \frac{5}{9}(21 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(-11) \approx -6.11°C \)
- 12°F → \( C = \frac{5}{9}(12 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(-20) \approx -11.11°C \)

Difference: ≈ 5°C — **not 12°C**

#### Example 2: 32°F and 23°F

- 32°F = 0°C  
- 23°F → \( \frac{5}{9}(23 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(-9) = -5°C \)  
Difference = 5°C — again, not 12°C.

#### Example 3: 41°F and 14°F

- 41°F → \( \frac{5}{9}(9) = 5°C \)  
- 14°F → \( \frac{5}{9}(-15) \approx -8.33°C \)  
Difference ≈ 13.33°C — close to 12, but not exact.

#### Try 50°F and 05°F = 5°F

- 50°F → \( \frac{5}{9}(18) = 10°C \)  
- 5°F → \( \frac{5}{9}(-27) = -15°C \)  
Difference = 25°C — no.

Wait — maybe the claim is about *specific* numbers? Let’s try known conversions:

- 10°C = 50°F  
- 22°C = 71.6°F  
- 34°C = 93.2°F  
No digit inversion.

Hold on — what about **-10°C = 14°F**, and **14°C = 57.2°F** — no.

Wait! There’s one famous pair:  
**-40°C = -40°F** — same number, so trivially “inverted” (palindrome), but not helpful.

Let’s try **21°C**:

- 21°C → \( \frac{9}{5}(21) + 32 = 37.8 + 32 = 69.8°F \)  
- 12°C → 53.6°F  
No.

What about **32°F = 0°C**, and **23°F ≈ -5°C** — difference 5°C.

Hmm.

Let’s search more systematically.

Suppose Fahrenheit values are digit reverses:  
Let \( F_1 = 10a + b \), \( F_2 = 10b + a \), where \( a, b \) are digits (0–9), and \( a \ne 0 \), \( b \ne 0 \) to avoid leading zeros.

Then their Celsius equivalents:

\[
C_1 = \frac{5}{9}(F_1 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(10a + b - 32) \\
C_2 = \frac{5}{9}(F_2 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(10b + a - 32)
\]

Difference:

\[
\Delta C = C_1 - C_2 = \frac{5}{9}[(10a + b) - (10b + a)] = \frac{5}{9}(9a - 9b) = 5(a - b)
\]

So the Celsius difference between two temperatures whose Fahrenheit values are digit reverses is always **5 × (difference of digits)**.

For this difference to be **12°C**, we’d need:

\[
5(a - b) = 12 \Rightarrow a - b = 12/5 = 2.4
\]

But \( a, b \) are integers → \( a - b \) must be integer → **impossible**.

✅ **Conclusion**:  
It is **mathematically impossible** for two temperatures whose Fahrenheit values are digit reverses to differ by exactly 12°C.

So the statement **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is **false** — or at best, a misleading or misremembered approximation.

---

### 🤔 Where might this idea come from?

Maybe confusion with the *approximate* rule:

> **"Double °C and add 30 ≈ °F"**

E.g.,  
- 10°C → 2×10 + 30 = 50°F (actual: 50°F — exact!)  
- 15°C → 2×15 + 30 = 60°F (actual: 59°F — close)  
- 20°C → 70°F (actual: 68°F)

But that’s unrelated to digit inversion.

Another possibility: mishearing **"every 5°C ≈ 9°F"** (since 9/5 = 1.8), and confusing it with digit patterns.

Or perhaps a folk mnemonic like:

> "21°C is about 70°F, and 12°C is about 54°F" — but 70 and 54 aren’t digit reverses.

Wait — 21 and 12 are digit reverses!  
But those are **Celsius** values, not Fahrenheit.

- 12°C = 53.6°F  
- 21°C = 69.8°F  
Not reverses.

Unless someone mistakenly thinks:  
"12°C ↔ 21°F"? Let’s check:  
21°F = −6.1°C — not 12°C.

So no.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The statement **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is **not accurate**.

- There is **no consistent pattern** where adding 12°C to a Celsius temperature causes the Fahrenheit value to have inverted digits.
- In fact, as shown above, if two Fahrenheit temperatures are digit reverses (e.g., 21 and 12), their Celsius difference is always a multiple of 5°C (specifically, 5×(a−b)), so **12°C difference is impossible**.

This may be a **misremembered or fabricated mnemonic** — perhaps confusing Celsius values (12 and 21) with Fahrenheit, or mixing up approximation rules.

✅ **Reliable conversion tip**:  
Use the exact formula:  
\[
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \quad \text{or} \quad C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)
\]  
For quick mental math:  
**°F ≈ 2×°C + 30** (good to within ~5°F for typical weather). [end of text]
