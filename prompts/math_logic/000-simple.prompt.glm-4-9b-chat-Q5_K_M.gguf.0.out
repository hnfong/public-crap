Sure, I can help with that. Here are the answers to the questions:

Q1: 1+1= 2
Q2: 6*7= 42
Q3: 83*59= 4897
Q4: 349*683= 239427
Q5: 6043*7489= 45001807
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to get x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is (25/100) * 80 = 20.
Q8: The cost of the book is $15. You gave $40 ($20 + $20) and received $5 as change, so the change should be $40 - $15 = $25.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so her mother has 3 + 1 = 4 children.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 as 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: If 5 guests have arrived, they need 5 slices of birthday cake.
Q13: If a shirt is on sale for 20% off, the sale price is $25 - (20/100) * $25 = $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes.
Q15: For a group of 22 people, you would need 22 / 4 = 5.5 taxis. Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis.
Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. If two angles are 31 and 62 degrees, the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.

Let me know if there's anything else you need!<|im_end|>
