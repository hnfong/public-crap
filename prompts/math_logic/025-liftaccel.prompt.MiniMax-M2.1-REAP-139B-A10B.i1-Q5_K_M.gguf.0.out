**Answer to all three questions**

### 1.  Time to go from floor 1 to floor 40  

**Given data**

* Height of each floor = 5 m  
* Number of floors = 40 → total distance \(d = 40 \times 5 = 200\) m  
* Lift acceleration (and deceleration) = \(a = 1\ \text{m/s}^2\)  
* Maximum speed = \(v_{\max}=5\ \text{m/s}\)

**Step‑by‑step**

1. **Find the distance needed to accelerate to \(v_{\max}\).**  
   Using \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\) with \(u=0\) and \(v=v_{\max}\):
   \[
   v_{\max}^2 = 2 a s_{\text{acc}} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad s_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\max}^2}{2a}
   = \frac{5^2}{2\cdot1}= \frac{25}{2}=12.5\ \text{m}
   \]

2. **Find the time to accelerate to \(v_{\max}\).**  
   Using \(v = u + at\):
   \[
   t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\max}}{a}= \frac{5}{1}=5\ \text{s}
   \]

3. **Find the distance needed to decelerate from \(v_{\max}\) to 0.**  
   By symmetry the deceleration distance is the same as the acceleration distance:
   \[
   s_{\text{dec}} = s_{\text{acc}} = 12.5\ \text{m}
   \]

4. **Find the time to decelerate.**  
   \[
   t_{\text{dec}} = \frac{v_{\max}}{a}=5\ \text{s}
   \]

5. **Find the distance travelled at constant speed.**  
   \[
   s_{\text{const}} = d - s_{\text{acc}} - s_{\text{dec}}
   = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175\ \text{m}
   \]

6. **Time at constant speed.**  
   \[
   t_{\text{const}} = \frac{s_{\text{const}}}{v_{\max}} = \frac{175}{5}=35\ \text{s}
   \]

7. **Total time.**  
   \[
   T_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{dec}}
   = 5 + 35 + 5 = \boxed{45\ \text{s}}
   \]

### 2.  Two people board at floor 1, one gets off at floor 10, the other at floor 30  

The lift must travel from floor 1 to floor 30 (the higher destination) and stop at floor 10 on the way.  
Thus the lift’s travel consists of two *separate* trips:

* **Trip A:** floor 1 → floor 10  
* **Trip B:** floor 10 → floor 30  

We compute the time for each trip using the same method as in Q1, but with the appropriate distances.

| Trip | Distance (m) | \(s_{\text{acc}}\) (m) | \(t_{\text{acc}}\) (s) | \(s_{\text{const}}\) (m) | \(t_{\text{const}}\) (s) | \(t_{\text{dec}}\) (s) | Total (s) |
|------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1→10 | \(10 \times 5 = 50\) | \(12.5\) | \(5\) | \(50-2\cdot12.5 = 25\) | \(25/5 = 5\) | \(5\) | \(5+5+5 = 15\) |
| 10→30| \(20 \times 5 = 100\) | \(12.5\) | \(5\) | \(100-2\cdot12.5 = 75\) | \(75/5 = 15\) | \(5\) | \(5+15+5 = 25\) |

**Total time** = time for Trip A + time for Trip B = \(15\ \text{s} + 25\ \text{s} = \boxed{40\ \text{s}}\).

*(Note: The lift does not need to stop at floor 1 again; the second passenger boards at floor 10 and the lift continues upward.)*

### 3.  One passenger goes to floor 40, the other to some *different* floor.  
**Goal:** Find the *minimum* possible time for the lift to reach floor 40 **while stopping at another floor** (any floor between 1 and 40, not floor 40 itself).  

Let the other passenger’s destination be floor \(k\) (where \(1 \le k \le 39\)).  
The lift must travel:

1. From floor 1 to floor \(k\) (stop there).  
2. From floor \(k\) to floor 40 (stop there).

Thus the total travel distance is the same as in Q1: \(200\) m.  
However, the lift must **decelerate to zero** at floor \(k\) and then **re‑accelerate** from zero to go to floor 40.  
These extra acceleration/deceleration phases increase the total time compared with the single‑trip case.

We need to choose \(k\) that **minimises** the total time.

---

#### General expression for total time when stopping at floor \(k\)

Let  

* \(d_1 = 5k\) m (distance from floor 1 to floor \(k\))  
* \(d_2 = 5(40-k) = 200 - 5k\) m (distance from floor \(k\) to floor 40)

For each segment we have the same acceleration/deceleration pattern as before:

* Acceleration distance: \(s_{\text{acc}} = 12.5\) m (provided the segment is long enough to reach \(v_{\max}\)).  
* Deceleration distance: also \(12.5\) m.

If a segment is **shorter** than \(2 s_{\text{acc}} = 25\) m, the lift cannot reach the maximum speed; it will accelerate for part of the distance and then immediately start decelerating.  
Thus we must treat two cases for each segment:

* **Long segment** (\(d \ge 25\) m): the lift accelerates to \(v_{\max}\), cruises, then decelerates.  
  Time for such a segment:  
  \[
  T_{\text{long}} = t_{\text{acc}} + \frac{d-2s_{\text{acc}}}{v_{\max}} + t_{\text{dec}}
  = 5 + \frac{d-25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{d-25}{5}
  \]

* **Short segment** (\(d < 25\) m): the lift accelerates for a distance \(s\) and then decelerates for the remaining distance, never reaching \(v_{\max}\).  
  For a symmetric triangular speed profile, the distance covered while accelerating from 0 to \(v\) and then decelerating back to 0 is \(s_{\text{acc}} = v^2/(2a)\).  
  Here the total distance is \(d\); the peak speed \(v_{\text{peak}}\) satisfies  
  \[
  d = \frac{v_{\text{peak}}^2}{a} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad v_{\text{peak}} = \sqrt{a d}
  \]
  The time to accelerate from 0 to \(v_{\text{peak}}\) is \(t_{\text{acc}}' = v_{\text{peak}}/a = \sqrt{d/a}\).  
  The deceleration time is the same, so the total time for a short segment is  
  \[
  T_{\text{short}} = 2\,\frac{\sqrt{d}}{a^{1/2}} = 2\sqrt{d}
  \]
  (since \(a=1\) m/s²).

Now we compute the total time for a given \(k\):

\[
T_{\text{total}}(k) = T_{\text{segment1}}(d_1) + T_{\text{segment2}}(d_2)
\]

where \(d_1 = 5k\) and \(d_2 = 200-5k\).

---

#### Determine which segments are long or short

* \(d_1 = 5k\) m.  
  It is **short** if \(5k < 25\) → \(k < 5\).  
  It is **long** if \(k \ge 5\).

* \(d_2 = 200-5k\) m.  
  It is **short** if \(200-5k < 25\) → \(5k > 175\) → \(k > 35\).  
  It is **long** if \(k \le 35\).

Thus we have three regimes for \(k\):

| Regime | \(k\) range | Segment 1 | Segment 2 |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| A | \(1 \le k \le 4\) | short | long |
| B | \(5 \le k \le 35\) | long | long |
| C | \(36 \le k \le 39\) | long | short |

We can compute \(T_{\text{total}}(k)\) in each regime.
