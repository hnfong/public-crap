This statement is a mnemonic or a memory aid, but it's not universally accurate for all temperatures. It's suggesting a pattern that appears in a few specific instances when converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, where the digits of the temperature in degrees Celsius seem to "flip" or invert when converted to Fahrenheit, or vice versa. 

To clarify, the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is done using the formula: 
\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

The "every 12°C" part is a bit misleading, as it's not a consistent mathematical relationship. It's more about observing a pattern in a few coincidental cases. 

For example:
- 0°C is 32°F (not inverted, but a starting point)
- 12°C is 53.6°F (12 and 53.6 are not inverted, but close to 53)
- 24°C is 75.2°F (24 and 75 are not inverted, but 24 and 57 would be inverted)
- 36°C is 96.8°F (36 and 96 are not inverted, but 36 and 69 would be inverted)

The pattern breaks down after this, as the next step would be 48°C, which converts to 118.4°F, and clearly, 48 and 118 are not inverted.

It's important to note that this is a coincidence and not a reliable method for conversion, as it only works for a very specific set of temperatures and doesn't hold true for most conversions. 

In summary, the statement is a simplification or a misinterpretation of a coincidental pattern in a few temperature conversions, and it's not a rule or a method to be used for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 

I hope this explanation clarifies the misunderstanding and provides a correct understanding of the conversion between these two temperature scales. If there's any part of this explanation that seems unclear, feel free to ask for further clarification. [end of text]
