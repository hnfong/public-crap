We need to produce a solution to the 24 game: given numbers 4,3,1,8, find an expression using each exactly once, with allowed operations (presumably +, -, *, /, parentheses) that yields 24. The user wants us to "double and triple check the result in the following format" and repeat attempts until we find a correct expression that uses exactly those numbers and yields 24.

We need to produce a series of attempts, each with a double-check, and keep trying until we find a correct expression. The user gave examples of attempts and double checks. We need to produce a final answer that is correct.

We need to ensure we use each number exactly once: 4,3,1,8. The allowed operations are typical: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses. Usually exponentiation is not allowed unless specified. So we need to find an expression that yields 24.

Let's think: 8 * 3 = 24, but we need to incorporate 4 and 1 in a way that doesn't change the result. For example, (8 * 3) * (4/4) = 24 * 1 = 24, but we need to use 1 as well. Could do (8 * 3) * (4/4) * 1 = 24. But we need to use each number exactly once, not twice. So we can't use 4 twice. We need to incorporate 1 and 4 in a neutral way. For example, (8 * 3) + (4 - 4) = 24 + 0 = 24, but that uses 4 twice. Not allowed.

We could do (8 * 3) + (4 - 1 - 3) = 24 + 0 = 24, but that uses 3 twice. Not allowed.

We could do (8 * 3) + (4 - 1) - 4 = 24 + 3 - 4 = 23. Not correct.
