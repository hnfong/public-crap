Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 - (4 - 1)) = 8 * (3 - 3) = 8 * 0 = 0, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 3) + (8 - 1) = 12 + 7 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * (3 - 1)) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.
