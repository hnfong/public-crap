### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Mathematical Properties:**
   - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are:  
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 → 16 divisors.
   - **Factorial:** 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. So it's the factorial of 5.
   - **Triangular Number:** The sum of the first 15 natural numbers:  
     1+2+...+15 = (15×16)/2 = 120.
   - **Octahedral Number:** It represents the number of spheres in a octahedral packing of a certain size.
   - **Abundant Number:** The sum of its proper divisors (1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 240) is greater than 120.
   - **Harshad Number:** 120 is divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0=3), and 120 ÷ 3 = 40.

2. **Scientific and Cultural Significance:**
   - **Degrees in a Triangle:** The sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180°, but 120° is a common angle in equilateral triangle subdivisions.
   - **Atomic Number:** Unbinilium (a synthetic element, symbol Ubn) has atomic number 120, though it hasn't been confirmed yet.
   - **Time:** 120 seconds = 2 minutes; 120 minutes = 2 hours.
   - **Sports:** In basketball, a "120-second violation" might refer to timeouts or shot clocks in some leagues.
   - **Religion:** In Christianity, 120 is associated with the number of disciples of Jesus (after the ascension of Jesus, before Pentecost).

**Answer:**  
The number 120 is significant because:
- It is **5! (factorial of 5)**.
- It is a **highly composite number** with 16 divisors.
- It is a **triangular number** (sum of 1 to 15).
- It is an **abundant number** (sum of proper divisors = 240).
- It is a **Harshad number** (divisible by sum of its digits).
- It appears in science (potential atomic number 120), time (2 minutes), and religion (120 disciples of Jesus).

### **Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

We solve the quadratic equation:
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
$$

**Method 1: Factoring**

We look for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Factors of -18:
- (1, -18) → sum = -17
- (-1, 18) → sum = 17
- (2, -9) → sum = -7 ✅

So:
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0
$$

Set each factor to zero:
- $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$
- $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$

**Method 2: Quadratic Formula**

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
Here, a = 1, b = -7, c = -18

$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$
$$
= \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
\Rightarrow x = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
$$

**Answer:**  
The solutions are $x = -2$ and $x = 9$.

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Distance for one round trip:**
   - One way = 200 km
   - Round trip = 2 × 200 = 400 km

2. **Time for one round trip:**
   - Speed = 60 km/h
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.666... hours = 6 hours 40 minutes = $6\frac{2}{3}$ hours

3. **Total time available:**
   - One full day = 24 hours

4. **Number of round trips:**
   - Number = Total time / Time per round trip = 24 ÷ (20/3) = 24 × (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

Since the train can't complete a partial round trip, we take the **integer part**.

**Answer:**  
The train can complete **3 full round trips** in a day.

(It would have completed 3.6 trips, but only 3 full ones.)
