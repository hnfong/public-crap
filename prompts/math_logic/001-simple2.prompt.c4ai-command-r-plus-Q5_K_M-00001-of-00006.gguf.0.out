Q1: The number 120 has several interesting mathematical properties and significance:

1. It is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller number. It has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This also makes it a very handy number in everyday life, as it can be divided evenly in many ways for measuring and counting purposes.

2. 120 is an abundant number, meaning the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself. The sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240.

3. It is the smallest number that is both a pentagonal and a hexagonal number, which means it can be represented visually as a pentagon and a hexagon with dots.

4. In geometry, an interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 108°, and since a full rotation is 360°, the sum of the interior angles of a regular pentagon is 540° = 120° * 3.

5. 120 is also related to the concept of percent, as 1% of 120 is 1.2, 10% is 12, and so on, making calculations involving percentages easier.

6. In music, the number 120 represents the number of semitones in an octave, and it is used in the design of musical instruments and composition.

7. The sum of the first five positive even numbers is 120: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 120

8. It is also the sum of the squares of the first four positive integers: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 120


Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

Plugging in the values, we get:

x = [-(-7) ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))] / 2(1)

x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2

x = [7 ± √121] / 2

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

This equation has two solutions: x = (7 + 11)/2 = 9, and x = (7 - 11)/2 = -2.

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make, we need to calculate the time taken for one round trip and then determine how many times that duration can fit into a full day (assuming a day is 24 hours).

Time taken for one round trip = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes)

Now, in a full day (24 hours), the train can make:
24 hours / 3.33 hours per round trip = approximately 7.2 round trips.

So, the train can make about 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
