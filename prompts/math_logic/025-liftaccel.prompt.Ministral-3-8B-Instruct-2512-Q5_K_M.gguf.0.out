Let's tackle each question one by one.

---

### **Given:**
- Number of floors: 40
- Height per floor: 5 meters
- Total height of building: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters
- Acceleration/deceleration (\( a \)): \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- Maximum speed (\( v_{\text{max}} \)): \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lift starts from rest (\( u = 0 \)).
2. The lift accelerates to \( v_{\text{max}} \), then moves at constant speed, then decelerates to rest.
3. The lift stops at each floor (including the ground floor and destination floors).
4. The time to stop at a floor is negligible (i.e., the lift instantly stops and starts moving again).

---

### **General Approach:**
The motion of the lift can be broken into three phases for each segment of travel:
1. **Acceleration phase**: The lift accelerates from rest to \( v_{\text{max}} \).
2. **Constant speed phase**: The lift moves at \( v_{\text{max}} \).
3. **Deceleration phase**: The lift decelerates from \( v_{\text{max}} \) to rest.

We will calculate the time and distance for each phase and sum them up.

---

### **Phase 1: Acceleration Phase**
Using the equation:
\[ v = u + at \]
Since \( u = 0 \) and \( v = v_{\text{max}} \):
\[ t_{\text{accel}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s} \]

Distance covered during acceleration (\( s_{\text{accel}} \)):
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]
\[ s_{\text{accel}} = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times (5)^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \]

---

### **Phase 2: Constant Speed Phase**
The lift moves at \( v_{\text{max}} \) until it needs to decelerate. The distance covered at constant speed is:
\[ s_{\text{const}} = \text{Total distance} - s_{\text{accel}} - s_{\text{decel}} \]
(We'll calculate \( s_{\text{decel}} \) next.)

---

### **Phase 3: Deceleration Phase**
This is symmetric to the acceleration phase:
\[ t_{\text{decel}} = t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \, \text{s} \]
\[ s_{\text{decel}} = s_{\text{accel}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} \]

---

### **Total Distance for a Segment:**
The lift must cover \( s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{const}} + s_{\text{decel}} \) to complete a segment (e.g., from ground to top).

For the entire trip (ground to top), the total distance is 200 m. However, the lift does not need to decelerate until it reaches the top floor, so the motion is slightly different for the last segment.

---

### **Question 1: Time to go from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**
The lift must cover 200 m. The motion is:
1. Accelerate to \( v_{\text{max}} \): covers 12.5 m in 5 s.
2. Move at \( v_{\text{max}} \): covers \( s_{\text{const}} \) at 5 m/s.
3. Decelerate to rest: covers 12.5 m in 5 s.

Total distance:
\[ s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{const}} + s_{\text{decel}} = 200 \]
\[ 12.5 + s_{\text{const}} + 12.5 = 200 \]
\[ s_{\text{const}} = 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m} \]

Time for constant speed:
\[ t_{\text{const}} = \frac{s_{\text{const}}}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s} \]

Total time:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{s} \]

However, this assumes the lift decelerates at the top floor. But the lift must stop at the top floor, so this calculation is correct.

**Answer to Q1:** It takes **45 seconds** to go from the ground floor to the top floor.

---

### **Question 2: Two people go to 10/F and 30/F**
The lift must stop at 10/F and 30/F. The total distance is still 200 m, but the lift must stop at intermediate floors.

We need to calculate the time for the lift to go from 1/F to 10/F and then from 10/F to 30/F.

#### **Segment 1: 1/F to 10/F**
Height: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) m.

The lift must accelerate, move at constant speed, and decelerate to stop at 10/F.

Using the same approach:
\[ s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{const}} + s_{\text{decel}} = 50 \]
\[ 12.5 + s_{\text{const}} + 12.5 = 50 \]
\[ s_{\text{const}} = 50 - 25 = 25 \, \text{m} \]
\[ t_{\text{const}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{s} \]
\[ t_{\text{total1}} = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s} \]

#### **Segment 2: 10/F to 30/F**
Height: \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) floors \( \times 5 = 100 \) m.

The lift must accelerate, move at constant speed, and decelerate to stop at 30/F.

\[ s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{const}} + s_{\text{decel}} = 100 \]
\[ 12.5 + s_{\text{const}} + 12.5 = 100 \]
\[ s_{\text{const}} = 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m} \]
\[ t_{\text{const}} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{s} \]
\[ t_{\text{total2}} = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s} \]

#### **Total Time:**
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{total1}} + t_{\text{total2}} = 15 + 25 = 40 \, \text{s} \]

**Answer to Q2:** It takes **40 seconds** for the lift to go from the ground floor to 10/F and then to 30/F.

---

### **Question 3: Two people go to 40/F, with a mandatory stop at another floor**
The lift must go from 1/F to 40/F, but it must stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F before reaching 40/F.

We need to find the minimum time for this scenario. The minimum time occurs when the lift stops at the floor closest to the top (i.e., 39/F), because stopping earlier would require more time to reach 40/F.

#### **Segment 1: 1/F to 39/F**
Height: \( 39 \times 5 = 195 \) m.

\[ s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{const}} + s_{\text{decel}} = 195 \]
\[ 12.5 + s_{\text{const}} + 12.5 = 195
