Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4897
Q4: 349*683=238887
Q5: 6043*7489=45257227
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5.
Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% = 0.25, so 0.25 * 80 = 20.
Q8: You gave the shopkeeper $55 ($20 + $20 + $5) for a $15 book. She should give you back $40.
Q9: Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 4 children (Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. Follow the order of operations: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: If 5 guests have arrived, and assuming each gets one slice, they need 5 slices of cake.
Q13: If a shirt is on sale for 20% off, calculate the discount: $25 * 20% = $5 off. So, the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. Convert to minutes: 2*60 + 45 = 120 + 45 = 165 minutes.
Q15: For 22 people, you would need 6 taxis (since 22 divided by 4, with a remainder, and you can't have part of a taxi for people).
Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, if two angles are 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
