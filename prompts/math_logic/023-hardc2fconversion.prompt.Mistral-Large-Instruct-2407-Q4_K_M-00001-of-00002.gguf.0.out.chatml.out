"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is providing a simple way to remember how to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. It's based on the pattern that occurs every 12 degrees Celsius, where the digits of the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit are reversed.

Here are a few examples to illustrate this:

- 0°C is equal to 32°F.
- 12°C is roughly 59°F (notice how the digits 1 and 2 are reversed to become 5 and 9).
- 24°C is roughly 75°F (the digits 2 and 4 are reversed to become 7 and 5).
- 36°C is roughly 96°F (the digits 3 and 6 are reversed to become 9 and 6).

So, for every increment of 12°C, you can quickly estimate the Fahrenheit equivalent by reversing the digits. However, this is just an estimation and the actual conversion formula is:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
