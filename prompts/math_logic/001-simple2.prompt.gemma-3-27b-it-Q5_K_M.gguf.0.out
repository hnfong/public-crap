## Answers to your questions:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Significance:** The number 120 appears in various contexts, often related to measurement and geometry. Some key areas include:

* **Angles in a polygon:** The sum of the interior angles of an octagon (an 8-sided polygon) is 120 degrees per angle (120 * 8 = 960 total degrees).
* **Degrees in a regular polygon:** Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108 degrees.  The exterior angle is 72 degrees.  120 is related to these through multiples and differences.
* **Factorial:** 120 is 5! (5 factorial), meaning 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Factorials are important in combinatorics and probability.
* **Time:** There are 120 minutes in 2 hours.

**Interesting Properties:**

* **Highly Composite Number:** 120 has a large number of divisors (factors) â€“ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.  Numbers with many divisors are called highly composite numbers.
* **Divisibility:** It's divisible by many numbers, making it useful in calculations involving fractions and proportions.
* **Prime Factorization:** 120 = 2<sup>3</sup> * 3 * 5. This shows the prime numbers that make up 120.
* **Tetrahedral Number:** 120 is a tetrahedral number, meaning it can be represented as a tetrahedron (a pyramid with a triangular base). Specifically, it's the 5th tetrahedral number (1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 = 35).
* **Smallest number divisible by 1 through 6:** 120 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 6.



**Q2: Solve the equation: x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Steps:**

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Factoring is the easiest method in this case.

1. **Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7.**  These numbers are -9 and 2.  (-9 * 2 = -18 and -9 + 2 = -7)

2. **Rewrite the equation using these numbers:**
   (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

3. **Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:**
   * x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
   * x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

**Therefore, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.**



**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time for one trip (one way):**
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately) or 3 hours and 20 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time for one round trip (to and from):**
   Round trip time = 2 * 3.33 hours = 6.66 hours (approximately) or 6 hours and 40 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time available in a day:**
   A full day has 24 hours.

4. **Calculate the number of round trips:**
   Number of round trips = Total time / Round trip time
   Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.66 hours = 3.60 (approximately)

5. **Since the train can only complete *whole* round trips, round down to the nearest whole number.**

**Therefore, the train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day.**
