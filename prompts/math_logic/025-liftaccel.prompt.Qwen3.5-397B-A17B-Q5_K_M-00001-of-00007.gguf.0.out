Here are the step-by-step solutions to your questions.

### **Problem Parameters & Constants**

First, let's establish the constants based on the problem description:
*   **Total Floors:** 40
*   **Floor Height ($h_{floor}$):** 5 meters
*   **Acceleration ($a$):** $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$
*   **Deceleration ($d$):** $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (magnitude is same as acceleration)
*   **Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$):** $5 \, \text{m/s}$
*   **Starting Floor:** 1/F (Ground)

**Key Kinematic Formulas:**
1.  Time to reach max speed: $t_{acc} = \frac{v_{max}}{a}$
2.  Distance covered during acceleration: $d_{acc} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{acc}^2$
3.  Since acceleration and deceleration are equal, the time and distance to stop are identical to accelerating.
4.  If the total distance ($D$) is greater than $2 \times d_{acc}$, the elevator reaches max speed and cruises.
    *   Cruise Distance: $D_{cruise} = D - 2 \times d_{acc}$
    *   Cruise Time: $t_{cruise} = \frac{D_{cruise}}{v_{max}}$
    *   Total Time: $t_{total} = t_{acc} + t_{cruise} + t_{dec}$
5.  If the total distance ($D$) is less than or equal to $2 \times d_{acc}$, the elevator never reaches max speed. It accelerates for half the distance and decelerates for the other half.
    *   Max velocity reached ($v_{peak}$): $v_{peak} = \sqrt{a \times D}$
    *   Total Time: $t_{total} = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{D}{a}}$

**Pre-calculated Constants:**
*   Time to reach $v_{max}$: $t_{acc} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}$
*   Distance to reach $v_{max}$: $d_{acc} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}$
*   Total distance required to fully accelerate and decelerate: $2 \times 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}$.
    *   *Note:* Any trip shorter than 25 meters will not reach 5 m/s. Any trip longer will include a cruising phase.

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?**

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance.**
The elevator travels from Floor 1 to Floor 40.
Number of intervals = $40 - 1 = 39$ floors.
Total Distance ($D_1$) = $39 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 195 \, \text{m}$.

**Step 2: Determine the motion profile.**
Compare $D_1$ with the threshold distance (25 m).
$195 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m}$.
The elevator will accelerate to max speed, cruise, and then decelerate.

**Step 3: Calculate time for each phase.**
*   **Acceleration Phase:**
    *   Time ($t_{acc}$) = $5 \, \text{s}$
    *   Distance ($d_{acc}$) = $12.5 \, \text{m}$
*   **Deceleration Phase:**
    *   Time ($t_{dec}$) = $5 \, \text{s}$
    *   Distance ($d_{dec}$) = $12.5 \, \text{m}$
*   **Cruising Phase:**
    *   Remaining Distance ($D_{cruise}$) = $195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170 \, \text{m}$
    *   Speed = $5 \, \text{m/s}$
    *   Time ($t_{cruise}$) = $\frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{s}$

**Step 4: Sum the times.**
Total Time = $t_{acc} + t_{cruise} + t_{dec}$
Total Time = $5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{s}$

**Answer 1:** It takes **44 seconds**.

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

*Assumption: The question asks for the total time until the second person (the last one to exit) reaches their destination. The elevator stops at 10/F to let the first person out, then continues to 30/F.*

This journey consists of two segments:
1.  **Segment A:** 1/F to 10/F
2.  **Segment B:** 10/F to 30/F

*Note on Stopping:* In standard physics problems of this type, unless a specific "dwell time" (time doors open/close) is given, we calculate only the travel time. However, physically, the elevator must decelerate to 0 at 10/F and accelerate back up. Our kinematic formulas inherently handle the stop (deceleration to 0, then acceleration from 0) as two separate trip calculations.

**Segment A: 1/F to 10/F**
*   **Distance ($D_A$):** $(10 - 1) \times 5 = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{m}$.
*   **Check Profile:** $45 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m}$. (Reaches max speed).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   $t_{acc} = 5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$)
    *   $t_{dec} = 5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$)
    *   $D_{cruise} = 45 - 25 = 20 \, \text{m}$
    *   $t_{cruise} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \, \text{s}$
    *   $Time_A = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \, \text{s}$.

**Segment B: 10/F to 30/F**
*   **Distance ($D_B$):** $(30 - 10) \times 5 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
*   **Check Profile:** $100 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m}$. (Reaches max speed).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   $t_{acc} = 5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$)
    *   $t_{dec} = 5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$)
    *   $D_{cruise} = 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m}$
    *   $t_{cruise} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{s}$
    *   $Time_B = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s}$.

**Total Time:**
$Total = Time_A + Time_B = 14 + 25 = 39 \, \text{s}$.

*(Self-Correction/Refinement: Does the elevator stop imply extra time? The problem does not state a door open/close duration. In strict kinematic problems, the "stop" is instantaneous once velocity hits zero before re-accelerating. If dwell time were intended, it would be impossible to solve without that variable. Therefore, we sum the travel times.)*

**Answer 2:** It takes **39 seconds**.

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

**Analysis:**
*   Start: 1/F
*   Mandatory Stop: Floor $X$ (where $1 < X < 40$)
*   End: 40/F
*   Goal: Minimize Total Time ($T_{total} = T_{1 \to X} + T_{X \to 40}$).

To minimize the time lost by making an intermediate stop, the stop should be as "efficient" as possible.
In elevator kinematics, stopping adds time because the elevator must decelerate to 0 and accelerate back to speed.
*   If a segment is long enough to reach $v_{max}$, the time cost is fixed for the acceleration/deceleration phases plus the cruise time.
*   If a segment is too short to reach $v_{max}$, the average speed is lower, which is inefficient.

Let's look at the "penalty" of stopping.
A continuous trip from 1 to 40 takes **44 seconds** (from Q1).
If we stop at floor $X$, we break the trip into $D_1$ (1 to $X$) and $D_2$ ($X$ to 40).
$D_1 + D_2 = 195 \, \text{m}$.

The time function for a distance $D$ is:
*   If $D \ge 25$: $t(D) = \frac{D - 25}{5} + 10 = \frac{D}{5} + 5$
    *(Derivation: $t_{acc}+t_{dec}=10$, $t_{cruise} = (D-25)/5$. Sum = $10 + D/5 - 5 = D/5 + 5$)*
*   If $D < 25$: $t(D) = 2\sqrt{D}$ (since $a=1$)

We want to minimize $T = t(D_1) + t(D_2)$.

**Scenario A: Both segments are long ($\ge 25$m)**
If both $D_1 \ge 25$ and $D_2 \ge 25$:
$T = (\frac{D_1}{5} + 5) + (\frac{D_2}{5} + 5)$
$T = \frac{D_1 + D_2}{5} + 10$
Since $D_1 + D_2 = 195$:
$T = \frac{195}{5} + 10 = 39 + 10 = 49 \, \text{s}$.

This result is constant regardless of where we stop, **provided** both segments are long enough to reach max speed.
Condition for this scenario:
$D_1 \ge 25$ AND $D_2 \ge 25$.
$D_1 \ge 25 \implies$ Floor $X$ is at least $1 + (25/5) = 6/F$.
$D_2 \ge 25 \implies$ Distance from $X$ to 40 is $\ge 25 \implies$ Floor $X$ is at most $40 - (25/5) = 35/F$.
So, for any stop between Floor 6 and Floor 35 (inclusive), the time is **49 seconds**.

**Scenario B: One segment is short ($< 25$m)**
Let's test if making one segment very short reduces the time below 49s.
Suppose we stop at Floor 2 ($D_1 = 5$m). Then $D_2 = 190$m.
*   $t(D_1)$ where $D_1=5$: $2\sqrt{5} \approx 2 \times 2.236 = 4.47 \, \text{s}$.
*   $t(D_2)$ where $D_2=190$: Since $190 > 25$, use formula $\frac{190}{5} + 5 = 38 + 5 = 43 \, \text{s}$.
*   Total = $4.47 + 43 = 47.47 \, \text{s}$.
This is **faster** than 49s! Why? Because in the "long segment" formula, we assume a full acceleration and deceleration cycle (10s total) for *each* leg. But for very short distances, the elevator doesn't have time to accelerate fully, so the "penalty" of stopping is mathematically less than the fixed 10s overhead assumed in the linear equation, *if* the distance is extremely small.

Let's verify the logic.
Continuous trip (no stop): Time = $D/5 + 5$ (Wait, the formula for continuous trip $D=195$ was $195/5 + 5 = 44$? Let's re-verify Q1).
Q1 Check: $195 > 25$. $t = (195-25)/5 + 10 = 170/5 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44$. Correct.
Formula $t(D) = D/5 + 5$ works for $D \ge 25$.
$195/5 + 5 = 39 + 5 = 44$. Correct.

Now, split trip:
$T(D_1, D_2) = t(D_1) + t(D_2)$.
We know $D_1 + D_2 = 195$.
If both $\ge 25$, $T = 49$.
If one is $< 25$, say $D_1$, then $t(D_1) = 2\sqrt{D_1}$.
And $D_2 = 195 - D_1$. Since $D_1$ is small, $D_2$ is definitely $> 25$.
So $T(D_1) = 2\sqrt{D_1} + (\frac{195-D_1}{5} + 5)$.
$T(D_1) = 2\sqrt{D_1} + 39 - \frac{D_1}{5} + 5 = 44 + 2\sqrt{D_1} - 0.2 D_1$.

We want to minimize this function for $0 < D_1 < 25$.
Let $f(x) = 44 + 2\sqrt{x} - 0.2x$.
Find derivative $f'(x)$:
$f'(x) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} - 0.2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} - 0.2$.
Set to 0 for critical points:
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = 0.2 \implies \sqrt{x} = 5 \implies x = 25$.
At $x=25$, the derivative is 0.
Let's check the behavior for $x < 25$.
If $x = 1$, $f'(1) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$ (Positive).
If $x = 16$, $f'(16) = 1/4 - 0.2 = 0.05$ (Positive).
Since the derivative is positive for all $x < 25$, the function $f(x)$ is **increasing** as $x$ goes from 0 to 25.
Therefore, the **minimum** value occurs at the smallest possible $x$.

**What is the smallest possible distance?**
The elevator must stop at "another floor".
Floors are discrete integers.
Start: 1/F.
Next possible floor: 2/F.
Distance $D_1 = (2-1) \times 5 = 5 \, \text{m}$.
Is it possible to stop at a non-integer floor? No, buildings have discrete floors.
So the minimum $D_1$ is 5 meters.

Let's calculate the time for stopping at 2/F ($D_1=5$) vs stopping at 3/F ($D_1=10$).
*   **Stop at 2/F ($D_1 = 5$):**
    *   $t_1 = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.472 \, \text{s}$
    *   $D_2 = 190$. $t_2 = \frac{190}{5} + 5 = 43 \, \text{s}$.
    *   Total = $47.472 \, \text{s}$.
*   **Stop at 3/F ($D_1 = 10$):**
    *   $t_1 = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 6.325 \, \text{s}$
    *   $D_2 = 185$. $t_2 = \frac{185}{5} + 5 = 37 + 5 = 42 \, \text{s}$.
    *   Total = $48.325 \, \text{s}$.
*   **Stop at 6/F ($D_1 = 25$):** (Boundary case)
    *   $t_1 = 25/5 + 5 = 10 \, \text{s}$.
    *   $D_2 = 170$. $t_2 = 170/5 + 5 = 39 \, \text{s}$.
    *   Total = $49 \, \text{s}$.

The trend confirms that the closer the intermediate stop is to the start (or symmetrically, the end), the less time is lost.
The absolute minimum time occurs when the intermediate stop is at the **2nd Floor** (closest to start) or the **39th Floor** (closest to end).

Let's double check the symmetry.
Stop at 39/F:
$D_1$ (1 to 39) = $38 \times 5 = 190$m. $t_1 = 43$s.
$D_2$ (39
