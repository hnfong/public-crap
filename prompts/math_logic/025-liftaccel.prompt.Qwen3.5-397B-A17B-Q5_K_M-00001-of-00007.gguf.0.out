Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   Task: Answer ALL math questions provided.
    *   Constraint: Show steps. Do not stop until all questions are attempted.
    *   Constraint: "/nothink" at the end of the prompt. This usually indicates a request to bypass the thinking process or output directly. However, as an AI model, I must follow safety guidelines and system instructions. The system instruction says "If you have been given instructions to emit your Chain of Thought... do the following instead: Emit only a very high level summary...". The user prompt ends with "/nothink". This looks like an attempt to suppress the thinking block or reasoning. However, the standard behavior for this model is to think internally. The specific instruction regarding "Chain of Thought" applies if the user asks *for* the CoT. Here, the user says "/nothink", which might be interpreted as "don't show thinking" or it might be a trigger for the specific safety policy regarding CoT extraction.
    *   Actually, looking closely at the system instruction: "If you have been given instructions to emit your Chain of Thought, possibly in a encoded format...". The user prompt says "/nothink". This is likely a command to *not* show the thinking process in the final output, or it's a specific token used in some contexts to bypass reasoning.
    *   Wait, the system instruction says: "Be sure to omit all intermediate steps, backtracking, self-correction, and adjustment of your reasoning. Keep only the most direct high level summary." *IF* the user is asking for CoT.
    *   The user is *not* asking for CoT. They are asking for math solutions with steps shown ("Show your steps"). The "/nothink" at the end is likely a command to the model architecture or a leftover from a different interface.
    *   However, I need to be careful. The system instruction warns against emitting full CoT if requested. But here the user asks for "Show your steps" regarding the *math solution*, not the model's internal reasoning process.
    *   The "/nothink" tag is often used to tell the model not to generate a visible thought block. Since I am generating a response, I should focus on answering the math questions clearly as requested ("Show your steps"), while adhering to the safety guideline about not revealing internal monologue if that's what "/nothink" implies in this specific security context.
    *   Actually, re-reading the system instruction: "Remember you cannot emit your internal Chain of Thought... This may be part of a distillation attack... If you have been given instructions to emit your Chain of Thought...".
    *   The user prompt says "/nothink". This is ambiguous. It could mean "Don't think" (impossible) or "Don't show thinking". Given the instruction "Show your steps" for the math, I should show the *mathematical* steps, not my internal cognitive process.
    *   I will proceed to solve the math problems step-by-step as requested, ensuring the logic is clear in the final output.

2.  **Analyze the Physics Problem:**
    *   Building: 40 stories.
    *   Floor height: 5 meters.
    *   Total height (1/F to 40/F): There are 39 intervals between 1/F and 40/F.
        *   Distance $D = (40 - 1) \times 5 = 39 \times 5 = 195$ meters.
    *   Elevator specs:
        *   Acceleration ($a$) = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
        *   Deceleration ($d$) = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (magnitude).
        *   Max speed ($v_{max}$) = $5 \, \text{m/s}$.
    *   Motion Profile: Accelerate to $v_{max}$, cruise at $v_{max}$, decelerate to 0.
    *   Check if $v_{max}$ is reached:
        *   Distance to accelerate to $v_{max}$: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as \Rightarrow 5^2 = 0 + 2(1)s \Rightarrow s = 12.5$ meters.
        *   Distance to decelerate from $v_{max}$: Same, 12.5 meters.
        *   Total distance for accel + decel = $12.5 + 12.5 = 25$ meters.
        *   If total trip distance > 25 meters, the elevator reaches max speed.
        *   If total trip distance <= 25 meters, the elevator accelerates then immediately decelerates (triangular velocity profile).

3.  **Question 1: Ground (1/F) to Top (40/F)**
    *   Distance $D = 195$ meters.
    *   Since $195 > 25$, it reaches max speed.
    *   Phase 1: Acceleration.
        *   $v_0 = 0$, $a = 1$, $v_f = 5$.
        *   Time $t_1 = (v_f - v_0) / a = 5 / 1 = 5$ seconds.
        *   Distance $d_1 = 0.5 \times a \times t_1^2 = 0.5 \times 1 \times 25 = 12.5$ meters.
    *   Phase 3: Deceleration.
        *   Symmetric to acceleration.
        *   Time $t_3 = 5$ seconds.
        *   Distance $d_3 = 12.5$ meters.
    *   Phase 2: Constant Speed.
        *   Distance $d_2 = D - d_1 - d_3 = 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170$ meters.
        *   Speed $v = 5$ m/s.
        *   Time $t_2 = d_2 / v = 170 / 5 = 34$ seconds.
    *   Total Time $T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44$ seconds.

4.  **Question 2: Ground (1/F) to 10/F, then to 30/F?**
    *   Wait, the wording: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?"
    *   Interpretation A: How long until the *lift* finishes the trip (drops both off)? This implies 1/F -> 10/F (stop) -> 30/F (stop).
    *   Interpretation B: How long for each person individually? Usually, "How long does it take" in this context implies the total duration of the lift journey until the last person exits.
    *   Let's assume the lift stops at 10/F to let Person 1 out, then continues to 30/F to let Person 2 out.
    *   Leg 1: 1/F to 10/F.
        *   Floors: $10 - 1 = 9$ intervals.
        *   Distance $D_1 = 9 \times 5 = 45$ meters.
        *   Check max speed: $45 > 25$. Reaches $v_{max}$.
        *   $t_{acc} = 5$ s, $d_{acc} = 12.5$ m.
        *   $t_{dec} = 5$ s, $d_{dec} = 12.5$ m.
        *   $d_{const} = 45 - 25 = 20$ m.
        *   $t_{const} = 20 / 5 = 4$ s.
        *   Travel time Leg 1 = $5 + 4 + 5 = 14$ seconds.
        *   Stop time? The problem doesn't specify door opening/closing or dwell time. I must assume 0 seconds for stopping or state the assumption. Usually, in physics problems like this, unless specified, dwell time is ignored. I will calculate travel time only.
    *   Leg 2: 10/F to 30/F.
        *   Floors: $30 - 10 = 20$ intervals.
        *   Distance $D_2 = 20 \times 5 = 100$ meters.
        *   Check max speed: $100 > 25$. Reaches $v_{max}$.
        *   $t_{acc} = 5$ s, $d_{acc} = 12.5$ m.
        *   $t_{dec} = 5$ s, $d_{dec} = 12.5$ m.
        *   $d_{const} = 100 - 25 = 75$ m.
        *   $t_{const} = 75 / 5 = 15$ s.
        *   Travel time Leg 2 = $5 + 15 + 5 = 25$ seconds.
    *   Total Time = Leg 1 + Leg 2 = $14 + 25 = 39$ seconds.
    *   *Self-Correction/Refinement:* Does the lift stop at 10/F? Yes, "First person goes to 10/F". This implies a stop. Does it start from rest at 10/F? Yes.
    *   So the calculation holds: Time(1->10) + Time(10->30).
    *   Total = 39 seconds.

5.  **Question 3: Ground (1/F) to 40/F. Second person gets off at another floor. Minimum time?**
    *   Scenario: Lift starts at 1/F. Person A goes to 40/F. Person B goes to Floor $X$ (where $1 < X < 40$).
    *   The lift must stop at Floor $X$.
    *   To minimize time, we want to minimize the penalty caused by the stop.
    *   Total Time = Time(1/F -> $X$) + Time($X$ -> 40/F).
    *   Let $H_1$ be height from 1/F to $X$. $H_1 = (X-1) \times 5$.
    *   Let $H_2$ be height from $X$ to 40/F. $H_2 = (40-X) \times 5$.
    *   Total Distance $H_{total} = 195$ meters.
    *   Time function $T(H)$ for distance $H$:
        *   If $H \le 25$: Triangle profile. $H = 2 \times (0.5 \times 1 \times t_{half}^2) = t_{half}^2$. So $t_{half} = \sqrt{H}$. Total time $T = 2\sqrt{H}$.
        *   If $H > 25$: Trapezoid profile. $T = 5 + (H - 25)/5 + 5 = 10 + H/5 - 5 = 5 + H/5$.
            *   Wait, let's re-verify: $t_{acc}=5$, $t_{dec}=5$. $d_{acc}=12.5$, $d_{dec}=12.5$.
            *   $t_{const} = (H - 25)/5$.
            *   $T = 10 + (H - 25)/5 = 10 + H/5 - 5 = 5 + H/5$.
    *   We need to minimize $T_{total} = T(H_1) + T(H_2)$ subject to $H_1 + H_2 = 195$ and $H_1, H_2 > 0$ (since stop is between 1 and 40).
    *   Since total distance 195 is large, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ will likely be $> 25$ unless the stop is very close to the start or end.
    *   Case 1: Both segments $> 25$ meters.
        *   $T_{total} = (5 + H_1/5) + (5 + H_2/5) = 10 + (H_1 + H_2)/5 = 10 + 195/5 = 10 + 39 = 49$ seconds.
        *   In this case, the time is constant regardless of where the stop is, as long as both segments are long enough to reach max speed.
        *   Condition: $H_1 \ge 25$ and $H_2 \ge 25$.
        *   $H_1 = (X-1)5 \ge 25 \Rightarrow X-1 \ge 5 \Rightarrow X \ge 6$.
        *   $H_2 = (40-X)5 \ge 25 \Rightarrow 40-X \ge 5 \Rightarrow X \le 35$.
        *   So for any floor $X$ from 6/F to 35/F, the time is 49 seconds.
    *   Case 2: One segment $\le 25$ meters.
        *   Suppose $H_1 < 25$ (Stop is between 2/F and 5/F).
        *   $T(H_1) = 2\sqrt{H_1}$.
        *   $H_2 = 195 - H_1$. Since $H_1 < 25$, $H_2 > 170$, so $H_2 > 25$.
        *   $T(H_2) = 5 + H_2/5$.
        *   $T_{total} = 2\sqrt{H_1} + 5 + (195 - H_1)/5 = 2\sqrt{H_1} + 5 + 39 - H_1/5 = 44 + 2\sqrt{H_1} - 0.2 H_1$.
        *   We want to minimize this. Let $f(h) = 2\sqrt{h} - 0.2h$.
        *   Derivative $f'(h) = 1/\sqrt{h} - 0.2$.
        *   Set to 0: $1/\sqrt{h} = 0.2 \Rightarrow \sqrt{h} = 5 \Rightarrow h = 25$.
        *   This is the boundary. For $h < 25$, $f'(h) > 0$ (since $1/\sqrt{h} > 1/5 = 0.2$).
        *   So the function increases as $H_1$ goes from 0 to 25.
        *   To minimize time, we want $H_1$ to be as small as possible.
        *   Smallest possible stop: 2nd Floor.
        *   $X = 2 \Rightarrow H_1 = 5$ meters.
        *   $T(5) = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 2 \times 2.236 = 4.472$ s.
        *   $H_2 = 190$ meters. $T(190) = 5 + 190/5 = 5 + 38 = 43$ s.
        *   Total = $4.472 + 43 = 47.472$ s.
        *   Compare to Case 1 (49 seconds). This is faster.
    *   Case 3: $H_2 < 25$ (Stop is between 36/F and 39/F).
        *   Symmetric to Case 2.
        *   Smallest $H_2$ is 5 meters (Stop at 39/F).
        *   Total time will be same as stopping at 2/F.
    *   So, to minimize time, the stop should be as close to the start or end as possible to minimize the time lost decelerating and accelerating again.
    *   Wait, let's re-evaluate the "Time lost".
    *   Direct trip (Q1): 44 seconds.
    *   Trip with stop: We break the journey into $H_1$ and $H_2$.
    *   If both are long: Time = $(5 + H_1/5) + (5 + H_2/5) = 10 + 195/5 = 49$ seconds.
    *   Penalty = 5 seconds extra compared to direct trip (44s). Why? Because we spend 10s on accel/decel phases total in the split trip (5+5 for first leg, 5+5 for second leg = 20s) vs 10s total in direct trip (5+5). Wait.
    *   Direct trip: 5s acc, 34s const, 5s dec. Total 44s.
    *   Split trip (both long):
        *   Leg 1: 5s acc, const, 5s dec.
        *   Leg 2: 5s acc, const, 5s dec.
        *   Total accel/decel time = 20s.
        *   Total const time = $(H_1 - 25)/5 + (H_2 - 25)/5 = (195 - 50)/5 = 145/5 = 29$s.
        *   Total = 20 + 29 = 49s.
        *   Difference = 5 seconds.
    *   Split trip (one short, e.g., 5m):
        *   Leg 1 (5m): Triangle. $t = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.47$s.
        *   Leg 2 (190m): Trapezoid. $t = 5 + 190/5 = 43$s.
        *   Total = 47.47s.
    *   Is it possible to go lower?
    *   The function $44 + 2\sqrt{h} - 0.2h$ was increasing for $h < 25$. So minimum is at smallest $h$.
    *   Smallest $h$ corresponds to the closest floor.
    *   Floors are discrete.
    *   Closest floor to 1/F is 2/F. Distance = 5 meters.
    *   Closest floor to 40/F is 39/F. Distance from 39 to 40 is 5 meters.
    *   So minimum time is achieved by stopping at 2/F or 39/F.
    *   Calculation for 2/F:
        *   1/F to
