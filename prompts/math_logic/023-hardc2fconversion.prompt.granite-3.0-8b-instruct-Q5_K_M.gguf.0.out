"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales. Here's how it works:

1. Start with a Celsius temperature, say 12°C.
2. Invert the digits: 12 becomes 21.
3. Add 140: 21 + 140 = 161°F.

So, 12°C is approximately 161°F.

Here's another example:

1. Start with a Celsius temperature, say 24°C.
2. Invert the digits: 24 becomes 42.
3. Add 140: 42 + 140 = 182°F.

So, 24°C is approximately 182°F.

This method is not entirely accurate, but it can give you a rough estimate. For precise conversions, you should use the formula:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Or, to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
