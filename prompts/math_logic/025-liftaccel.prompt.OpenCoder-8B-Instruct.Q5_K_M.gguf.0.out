1. The time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is the total distance divided by the speed. The total distance is the height of the building (40 floors * 5 meters/floor) = 200 meters. The speed is the maximum speed of the elevator, which is 5m/s. So, the time is 200m / 5m/s = 40 seconds.

2. The first person travels a distance of 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters. The second person travels a distance of 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters. Together, they travel a total distance of 200 meters. The time it takes for them to travel together is the total distance divided by the speed, which is 200m / 5m/s = 40 seconds.

3. The first person travels a distance of 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters. The time it takes for the first person to travel is the total distance divided by the speed, which is 200m / 5m/s = 40 seconds. The lift has to stop at every floor between 1/F and 40/F, so the total time it takes for the lift to get to the top floor is the time it takes for the first person to travel plus the time it takes for the lift to stop at each floor. The time it takes for the lift to stop at each floor is the acceleration (1m/s^2) multiplied by the distance (5m) divided by 2 (because acceleration is distance over time squared). So, the total time is 40 seconds + (40 floors * 1m/s^2 * 5m / 2) = 40 seconds + 100 seconds = 140 seconds.
```python
# Python code to solve the problem
# Question 1
def time_to_reach_top_floor():
    distance = 40 * 5  # total distance in meters
    speed = 5  # maximum speed in meters per second
    return distance / speed  # time in seconds

# Question 2
def time_to_travel_together():
    distance_person1 = 10 * 5  # distance for first person in meters
    distance_person2 = 30 * 5  # distance for second person in meters
    total_distance = distance_person1 + distance_person2  # total distance in meters
    speed = 5  # maximum speed in meters per second
    return total_distance / speed  # time in seconds

# Question 3
def time_to_reach_top_floor_with_stops():
    distance_person1 = 40 * 5  # distance for first person in meters
    stop_time_per_floor = 1 * 5 / 2  # time to stop at each floor in seconds
    total_stops = 40  # number of stops between ground and top floor
    total_time = distance_person1 / 5 + total_stops * stop_time_per_floor
    return total_time

# Test cases
print(time_to_reach_top_floor())  # Expected output: 40
print(time_to_travel_together())  # Expected output: 40
print(time_to_reach_top_floor_with_stops())  # Expected output: 140
