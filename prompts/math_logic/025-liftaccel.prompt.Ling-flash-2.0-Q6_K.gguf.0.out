We are given:

- A 40-story building.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall → total height = 40 × 5 = **200 meters**.
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration = **1 m/s²**.
- Maximum speed = **5 m/s**.

We'll solve each question step by step.

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

We need to calculate the time to go from floor 1 (ground) to floor 40 (top), i.e., **200 meters**.

The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches max speed (5 m/s), then travels at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at the top.

Let’s break it into phases:

#### **Phase 1: Acceleration**
- Acceleration: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Final speed: $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $
- Time to accelerate:  
  $ t_a = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{seconds} $
- Distance covered during acceleration:  
  $ d_a = \frac{1}{2} a t_a^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 25 = 12.5 \, \text{m} $

#### **Phase 2: Deceleration**
Same as acceleration, but in reverse.
- Time to decelerate: $ t_d = 5 \, \text{s} $
- Distance covered during deceleration: $ d_d = 12.5 \, \text{m} $

#### **Phase 3: Constant speed**
Total distance: 200 m  
Distance used in acceleration and deceleration: $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $  
So distance at constant speed: $ d_c = 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m} $

Time at constant speed:  
$ t_c = \frac{d_c}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds} $

#### **Total time:**
$ t = t_a + t_c + t_d = 5 + 35 + 5 = \boxed{45} \text{seconds} $

✅ **Answer to Q1: 45 seconds**

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

We need to find the time until both reach their destinations. Since the elevator must stop at both floors, it will:

- Go from ground (1/F) to 10/F (50 m up), stop, then go to 30/F (150 m up from ground), stop.

But the elevator path is:
- Start at 0 m (ground)
- Accelerate → constant speed → decelerate to stop at 10/F (50 m)
- Then accelerate again → constant speed → decelerate to stop at 30/F (150 m)

We need to compute total time.

Let’s break it into two segments:

---

#### **Segment 1: Ground to 10/F (50 m)**

Same acceleration/deceleration logic.

- Acceleration time: 5 s
- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- So distance at constant speed: 50 - 25 = 25 m
- Time at constant speed: 25 / 5 = 5 s
- Time for segment 1: 5 (accel) + 5 (const) + 5 (decel) = **15 seconds**

Wait: But deceleration is only needed if we stop. Since we are stopping at 10/F, yes, we must decelerate.

So total time to reach 10/F: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 s

---

#### **Segment 2: From 10/F to 30/F (100 m upward)**

Now, starting from rest at 10/F (50 m), need to go to 150 m (30/F), so 100 m.

Again, acceleration, constant speed, deceleration.

Check if elevator can reach max speed in this 100 m.

- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- So distance for accel + decel = 25 m
- Remaining distance: 100 - 25 = 75 m
- Time at constant speed: 75 / 5 = 15 s
- Acceleration time: 5 s
- Deceleration time: 5 s
- Total time for segment 2: 5 + 15 + 5 = **25 seconds**

---

#### **Total time:**
Time to 10/F: 15 s  
Time from 10/F to 30/F: 25 s  
Total: 15 + 25 = **40 seconds**

Wait — but is the elevator starting from rest at 10/F? Yes, because it stops there.

So total time is 40 seconds.

✅ **Answer to Q2: 40 seconds**

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

So:
- One person wants to go to 40/F (200 m)
- Another person wants to go to some other floor (say floor X, between 1 and 40)
- The elevator must stop at that intermediate floor before reaching 40/F.
- We are to find the **minimum possible time** to reach 40/F under this constraint.

We are to **minimize** the time to reach 40/F, given that the elevator must stop at **at least one** other floor on the way.

So the elevator path is:
- Start at ground (0 m)
- Possibly accelerate → constant speed → decelerate to stop at intermediate floor (say floor k, height = 5k m)
- Then accelerate again → constant speed → decelerate to stop at 40/F (200 m)

We want to choose the intermediate floor such that the total time is minimized.

Let’s denote:
- Let the intermediate floor be at height $ h = 5k $ meters, where $ k $ is integer from 1 to 39.
- We must stop at h, then go to 200 m.

We need to compute total time as a function of h, and find the h that minimizes it.

But since the motion involves acceleration/deceleration, and max speed is 5 m/s, we can consider different cases.

Let’s think: To minimize time, we want to minimize the extra stopping time. The more we can use constant speed, the better.

But stopping at an intermediate floor adds two acceleration/deceleration phases.

Let’s analyze possible strategies.

#### **Idea: What if the elevator goes fast, but must stop at one floor on the way?**

We can consider that the elevator may:
- Accelerate to max speed
- Travel at max speed
- Decelerate to stop at
