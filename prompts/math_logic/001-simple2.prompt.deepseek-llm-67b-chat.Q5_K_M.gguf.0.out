Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 is an abundant number (the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself), it is an even number, and it is divisible by the first six counting numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Additionally, 120 is the product of the first four counting numbers. It is also a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any other number below it. 

A2: The equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be factored into (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0. So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h and the distance between the two cities is 200 km. Therefore, the time taken for one round trip (to and fro) is (200 + 200) / 60 = 6.67 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the train can make 24 / 6.67 â‰ˆ 3.58 round trips within a full day. However, we need to round it down to the nearest whole number, so the train can make 3 round trips within a full day.
