Let's tackle each question one by one.

### Given:
- Building height: 40 floors
- Each floor height: 5 meters
- Total height: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters
- Lift acceleration/deceleration: \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- Maximum speed: \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Key Concepts:
1. **Time to reach max speed**: \( t = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s} \)
2. **Distance covered while accelerating to max speed**: \( d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \)
3. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: Same as acceleration time, \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Distance covered at max speed**: If total distance \( D \) is greater than \( 2 \times 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} \), then the lift will spend some time at max speed. Otherwise, it will not reach max speed.

### Question 1: Time from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)
Total distance: \( 200 \, \text{m} \).

Since \( 200 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m} \), the lift will reach max speed.

1. **Time to accelerate to max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
2. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
3. **Distance covered at max speed**: \( 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Time at max speed**: \( \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{s} \).

### Question 2: Two people going to 10/F and 30/F
Total distance: \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m} \) (since the lift goes to 30/F).

Since \( 150 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m} \), the lift will reach max speed.

1. **Time to accelerate to max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
2. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
3. **Distance covered at max speed**: \( 150 - 25 = 125 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Time at max speed**: \( \frac{125}{5} = 25 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \, \text{s} \).

### Question 3: Two people going to 40/F and another floor (not 40/F)
We need to find the minimum time for the lift to reach 40/F while stopping at another floor. The minimum time occurs when the lift stops at the highest possible floor before 40/F, minimizing the distance traveled at max speed.

Let’s assume the lift stops at floor \( n \) (where \( n \) is between 1 and 39). The lift will:
1. Accelerate to max speed.
2. Travel at max speed until it needs to decelerate to stop at floor \( n \).
3. Accelerate again from floor \( n \) to max speed.
4. Travel at max speed until it needs to decelerate to stop at 40/F.

To minimize time, the lift should not spend any time at max speed between stops. This means the distance between stops should be exactly \( 25 \, \text{m} \) (so the lift just reaches max speed and immediately starts decelerating).

Distance between stops: \( 25 \, \text{m} \), which is \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) floors.

So, the lift can stop at floor 5, then 10, then 15, ..., up to 40. But since the second person does not go to 40/F, the highest possible stop before 40/F is 35/F.

Thus, the sequence is:
1. Ground floor (1/F) to 35/F (34 floors, \( 34 \times 5 = 170 \, \text{m} \)).
2. Stop at 35/F.
3. 35/F to 40/F (5 floors, \( 25 \, \text{m} \)).

Now, calculate time for each segment:

**Segment 1: 1/F to 35/F (170 m)**
- Accelerate to max speed: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Decelerate from max speed: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Distance at max speed: \( 170 - 25 = 145 \, \text{m} \).
- Time at max speed: \( \frac{145}{5} = 29 \, \text{s} \).
- Total time for segment 1: \( 5 + 29 + 5 = 39 \, \text{s} \).

**Segment 2: 35/F to 40/F (25 m)**
- Accelerate to max speed: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Decelerate from max speed: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Distance at max speed: \( 25 - 25 = 0 \, \text{m} \).
- Time at max speed: \( 0 \, \text{s} \).
- Total time for segment 2: \( 5 + 0 + 5 = 10 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 39 + 10 = 49 \, \text{s} \).

However, this is not the minimum time. The minimum time occurs when the lift stops at the highest possible floor where the distance from the previous stop is exactly \( 25 \, \text{m} \). 

Let’s try stopping at 35/F (as above), but the time is 49 s. Alternatively, stopping at 30/F:

**Segment 1: 1/F to 30/F (150 m)**
- Accelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Decelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Max speed distance: \( 150 - 25 = 125 \, \text{m} \).
- Time at max speed: \( 25 \, \text{s} \).
- Total time: \( 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \, \text{s} \).

**Segment 2: 30/F to 40/F (100 m)**
- Accelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Decelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
- Max speed distance: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m} \).
- Time at max speed: \( 15 \, \text{s} \).
- Total time: \( 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 35 + 25 = 60 \,
