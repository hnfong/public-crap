### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

1. **Factorization**: 120 = 2³ × 3 × 5, which makes it a highly composite number (it has more divisors than any smaller number).
2. **Divisors**: The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors in total).
3. **Sum of Divisors**: The sum of the divisors of 120 is 360, which is greater than 120, making it an abundant number.
4. **Triangular Number**: 120 is the 15th triangular number, meaning it can be represented as a triangle of dots with 15 rows (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120).
5. **Factorial**: 120 is also 5! (5 factorial), which is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
6. **Euclidean Algorithm**: 120 is used in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
7. **Historical Significance**: The Babylonians and ancient Greeks studied 120, and it appears in various cultural and religious contexts (e.g., 120 is the number of years of the life of Moses in Jewish tradition).

### Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**
To solve the quadratic equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these into the formula:

1. Calculate the discriminant (Δ):
   \[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
   \[ \sqrt{\Delta} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Apply the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Find the two solutions:
   \[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   \[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   - Distance for one round trip = 200 km (to the other city) + 200 km (back) = 400 km.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666... hours.

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**
   - Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6.

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make **3 full round trips** in a day. 

**Final Answer:**
The train can make 3 round trips within a full day.

### Summary of Answers:
1. The number 120 is a highly composite number, a triangular number, 5 factorial, and has many other interesting properties.
2. The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).
3. The train can make 3 round trips within a full day.
