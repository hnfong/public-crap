There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. The time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the height of the building, which is 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given by the formula:

Speed = Acceleration x Time

In this case, the acceleration is given as 1 m/s^2 and the maximum speed is given as 5 m/s.

So, the speed of the lift at the top floor is:

Speed = Acceleration x Time
Speed = 1 m/s^2 x Time
Speed = Time

Therefore, the time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 meters / 5 m/s
Time = 40 seconds

2. The time taken for the first person to go from the ground floor to 10/f is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the height of the building, which is 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given by the formula:

Speed = Acceleration x Time

In this case, the acceleration is given as 1 m/s^2 and the maximum speed is given as 5 m/s.

So, the speed of the lift at the 10/f floor is:

Speed = Acceleration x Time
Speed = 1 m/s^2 x Time
Speed = 10 m/s

Therefore, the time taken for the first person to go from the ground floor to 10/f is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 meters / 10 m/s
Time = 20 seconds

The time taken for the second person to go from the ground floor to 30/f is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the height of the building, which is 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given by the formula:

Speed = Acceleration x Time

In this case, the acceleration is given as 1 m/s^2 and the maximum speed is given as 5 m/s.

So, the speed of the lift at the 30/f floor is:

Speed = Acceleration x Time
Speed = 1 m/s^2 x Time
Speed = 30 m/s

Therefore, the time taken for the second person to go from the ground floor to 30/f is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 meters / 30 m/s
Time = 6.67 seconds

The time taken for both people to go from the ground floor to 30/f is given by the formula:

Time = Time1 + Time2

In this case, Time1 = 6.67 seconds and Time2 = 20 seconds.

Therefore, the time taken for both people to go from the ground floor to 30/f is:

Time = Time1 + Time2
Time = 6.67 seconds + 20 seconds
Time = 26.67 seconds

3. The time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to 40/f is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the height of the building, which is 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is given by the formula:

Speed = Acceleration x Time

In this case, the acceleration is given as 1 m/s^2 and the maximum speed is given as 5 m/s.

So, the speed of the lift at the 40/f floor is:

Speed = Acceleration x Time
Speed = 1 m/s^2 x Time
Speed = 40 m/s

Therefore, the time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to 40/f is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 meters / 40 m/s
Time = 5 seconds

The time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to 40/f and stop at another floor between 1/f and 40/f is given by the formula:

Time = Time1 + Time2 + Time3

In this case, Time1 is the time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to 40/f, which is 5 seconds.

Time2 is the time taken for the lift to go from the 40/f floor to the other floor between 1/f and 40/f.

Time3 is the time taken for the lift to go from the other floor to the ground floor.

Therefore, the time taken for the lift to go from the ground floor to 40/f and stop at another floor between 1/f and 40/f is given by the formula:

Time = Time1 + Time2 + Time3
Time = 5 seconds + Time2 + Time3
Time = 5 seconds + Time2 + Time3
