Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: the significance of the number 120. Hmm, I know that 120 is a factorial number? Wait, 5! is 120, right? Because 5×4×3×2×1=120. That's correct. Also, in terms of factors, 120 has a lot of divisors. Let me list them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 factors. Maybe it's the number of seconds in 2 minutes? Wait, no, 2 minutes is 120 seconds. Yes, that's right. Also, in time, 120 minutes is 2 hours. In sports, like badminton has 45 minutes per game, but maybe not. Wait, 120 is also the number of minutes in 2 hours. Oh, and in history, the Roman numeral for 120 is CXX. Not sure if that's significant. Also, in chemistry, molar mass of some elements? Maybe not. In mathematics, 120 is a practical number because it can be expressed as the sum of its proper divisors. Wait, let me check. The proper divisors of 120 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60. Adding them up: 1+2=3, +3=6, +4=10, +5=15, +6=21, +8=29, +10=39, +12=51, +15=66, +20=86, +24=110, +30=140, +40=180, +60=240. Wait, that's more than 120. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's do it step by step:

1+2=3

3+3=6

6+4=10

10+5=15

15+6=21

21+8=29

29+10=39

39+12=51

51+15=66

66+20=86

86+24=110

110+30=140

140+40=180

180+60=240. Hmm, that's 240, which is indeed greater than 120. So yes, 120 is a practical number because it can be expressed as the sum of its proper divisors in multiple ways. Also, in the context of the 120-day period in some calendars? Not sure. Maybe in pop culture, like the number 120 is used for something? Or in measurements, like 120 volts AC electricity. Yes, that's a key point. Also, in the number of years in some eras? Maybe not. So summarizing, 120 is 5!, has 16 factors, 120 seconds in 2 minutes, 120 minutes in 2 hours, 120 volts AC, and a practical number.

Moving on to Q2: Solve the equation x² -7x -18 =0. Let's see. Quadratic equation, so using quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2. Because the equation is ax² + bx + c =0, so a=1, b=-7, c=-18. Wait, wait, actually, the equation is x² -7x -18 =0, so a=1, b=-7, c=-18. Then discriminant is b² -4ac = (-7)^2 -4*1*(-18) = 49 +72=121. sqrt(121)=11. So x = [7 ±11]/2. So two solutions: (7+11)/2=18/2=9, and (7-11)/2=(-4)/2=-2. So the roots are 9 and -2. Let me check by plugging back in: 9² -7*9 -18=81-63-18=0. Yes. And (-2)^2 -7*(-2) -18=4+14-18=0. Correct. So the solutions are x=9 and x=-2.

Q3: A train travels at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. Time stationed in cities is negligible. How many round trips can it make in a full day? A full day is 24 hours. So first, calculate the time for one round trip. One way is 200 km at 60 km/h, so time one way is 200/60 = 3.333... hours, which is 3 hours and 20 minutes. Round trip would be double that, so 6.666... hours, which is 6 hours and 40 minutes. Wait, let me compute it exactly. 200 km one way at 60 km/h: time = distance/speed = 200/60 = 10/3 hours ≈3.3333 hours. Round trip: 2*(200/60) = 400/60 = 20/3 ≈6.6667 hours. So in 24 hours, how many times 20/3 hours fits? 24 divided by (20/3) = 24 * 3/20 = (24/20)*3 = (6/5)*3 = 18/5 = 3.6. But since the train can't make a fraction of a round trip, it can complete 3 full round trips, with some time left. Wait, but maybe the calculation is different. Let me check again. Wait, the time for one round trip is 200 km each way, so total distance 400 km. At 60 km/h, time is 400/60 = 6.666... hours, which is 6 hours 40 minutes. So in 24 hours, how many times? 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 /20 = 72/20 = 3.6. So 3 full round trips, with 0.6 of a round trip left. But since the time stationed is negligible, maybe the train can start another round trip but not complete it. So the answer would be 3 round trips. Wait, but maybe the calculation is different. Let me verify. Alternatively, compute the time per one way: 200/60 = 3.333... hours. Round trip: 6.666... hours. 24 divided by 6.666... is 3.6. So 3 full round trips. But perhaps the question expects considering that the train starts at time t=0, makes the first round trip in 6.666 hours, then the second in another 6.666 hours, third in another 6.666, totaling 19.999 hours, leaving 24 - 19.999 = 4.001 hours. But in that remaining time, can it start another round trip? Let's see: the time needed for a round trip is 6.666 hours. If there's 4 hours left, which is less than 6.666, so it can't complete another round trip. Therefore, only 3 round trips. But wait, maybe the calculation is different. Alternatively, maybe the time is calculated as one way time. Wait, the train goes from city A to B (200 km) at 60 km/h, which takes 3.333 hours, then returns, same time. So round trip is 6.666 hours. So in 24 hours, 24 / 6.666... = 3.6, so 3 full round trips. So answer is 3. But wait, maybe the problem is expecting 4
