Sure, let's tackle each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

1. **Factorial Representation**: The number 120 is significant because it is the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!.
   - \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)

2. **Divisibility**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many divisors. The divisors of 120 are:
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

3. **Prime Factorization**: The prime factorization of 120 is:
   - \( 120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \)

4. **Historical and Cultural Significance**: In various cultures and historical contexts, the number 120 has been considered significant. For example, in the Bible, there are 120 disciples of Jesus.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

1. **Identify the coefficients**: The quadratic equation is \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \).
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

2. **Use the quadratic formula**: The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).

3. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   - \( b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \)

4. **Find the roots**:
   - \( x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \)

5. **Solve for x**:
   - \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. **Calculate the time for one trip**:
   - Distance between the two cities = 200 km
   - Speed of the train = 60 km/h
   - Time for one trip = \( \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip**:
   - Time for a round trip = \( 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day**:
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - Number of round trips = \( \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \)

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day. [end of text]
