This is a clever trick to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit quickly. Here's how it works:

When you see a temperature in Celsius, simply invert the digits (i.e., swap the tens and ones place) and multiply the result by 2. Then, add 30 to get the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.

Here are some examples:

* 25°C: Invert the digits to get 52. Multiply by 2: 52 × 2 = 104. Add 30: 104 + 30 = 134°F
* 37°C: Invert the digits to get 73. Multiply by 2: 73 × 2 = 146. Add 30: 146 + 30 = 176°F
* 50°C: Invert the digits to get 05. Multiply by 2: 05 × 2 = 10. Add 30: 10 + 30 = 40°F

This trick works because the formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

When you invert the digits and multiply by 2, you're essentially doing the following calculation:

(°C × 9/5) × 2 = °C × 18/5

Since 18/5 is close to 3.6, which is roughly 9/5, this trick gives a close approximation of the correct conversion. However, it's not exact, so it's not suitable for precise calculations. But for rough estimates or everyday conversions, this trick can be a useful mental math shortcut! [end of text]
