### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a 40-story building where each floor is 5 meters tall. The elevator accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s² and reaches a maximum speed of 5 m/s. We need to find the total time it takes for the elevator to go from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F).

**Breaking Down the Problem:**

1. **Total Height:**
   - Number of floors: 40
   - Height per floor: 5 meters
   - Total height: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters

2. **Elevator Motion:**
   - Acceleration/Deceleration: 1 m/s²
   - Maximum Speed: 5 m/s

**Approach:**

The elevator's motion can be divided into three phases:
1. **Acceleration Phase:** The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed.
2. **Constant Speed Phase:** The elevator travels at its maximum speed.
3. **Deceleration Phase:** The elevator decelerates from its maximum speed to rest.

We'll calculate the time taken for each phase and sum them up to get the total time.

**Calculations:**

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Acceleration (\( a \)) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Time to reach maximum speed (\( t_1 \)):
     \[
     v = a \times t_1 \implies t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during acceleration (\( d_1 \)):
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Maximum speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Distance to cover at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
     \[
     d_2 = \text{Total height} - d_1 - d_3 = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Time taken at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Deceleration (\( a \)) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (\( v \)) = 0 m/s
   - Time to decelerate (\( t_3 \)):
     \[
     t_3 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during deceleration (\( d_3 \)):
     \[
     d_3 = \frac{1}{2} a t_3^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

**Total Time:**

\[
\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Answer:**

It takes **45 seconds** for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Understanding the Problem:**

Two people board the elevator at the ground floor. The first person wants to go to the 10th floor, and the second person wants to go to the 30th floor. We need to find the total time it takes for both trips.

**Breaking Down the Problem:**

1. **First Trip:**
   - From ground floor (1/F) to 10/F
   - Distance: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) meters

2. **Second Trip:**
   - From 10/F to 30/F
   - Distance: \( (30 - 10) \times 5 = 100 \) meters

**Approach:**

We'll calculate the time taken for each trip separately and then sum them up.

**Calculations:**

1. **First Trip (Ground to 10/F):**
   - Total distance (\( d \)) = 50 meters
   - Maximum speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Acceleration/Deceleration (\( a \)) = 1 m/s²

   **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed (\( t_1 \)):
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during acceleration (\( d_1 \)):
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

   **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Distance to cover at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
     \[
     d_2 = d - d_1 - d_3 = 50 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 25 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Time taken at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Time to decelerate (\( t_3 \)):
     \[
     t_3 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during deceleration (\( d_3 \)):
     \[
     d_3 = \frac{1}{2} a t_3^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

   **Total Time for First Trip:**
   \[
   t_{\text{first}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Second Trip (10/F to 30/F):**
   - Total distance (\( d \)) = 100 meters
   - Maximum speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Acceleration/Deceleration (\( a \)) = 1 m/s²

   **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed (\( t_1 \)):
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during acceleration (\( d_1 \)):
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2
