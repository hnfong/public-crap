There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?
### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a 40-story building where each floor is 5 meters tall. The elevator accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s² and reaches a maximum speed of 5 m/s. We need to find the total time it takes for the elevator to go from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F).

**Breaking Down the Problem:**

1. **Total Height:**
   - Number of floors: 40
   - Height per floor: 5 meters
   - Total height: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters

2. **Elevator Motion:**
   - Acceleration/Deceleration: 1 m/s²
   - Maximum Speed: 5 m/s

**Approach:**

The elevator's motion can be divided into three phases:
1. **Acceleration Phase:** The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed.
2. **Constant Speed Phase:** The elevator travels at its maximum speed.
3. **Deceleration Phase:** The elevator decelerates from its maximum speed to rest.

We'll calculate the time taken for each phase and sum them up to get the total time.

**Calculations:**

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Acceleration (\( a \)) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Time to reach maximum speed (\( t_1 \)):
     \[
     v = a \times t_1 \implies t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Distance covered during acceleration (\( d_1 \)):
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Maximum speed (\( v \)) = 5 m/s
   - Distance to cover at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
     \[
     d_2 = \text{Total height} - d_1 - d_3 = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Time taken at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Similar to acceleration, time to decelerate (\( t_3 \)) = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during deceleration (\( d_3 \)) = 12.5 meters

**Total Time:**

\[
\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Answer to Question 1:**

It takes **45 seconds** for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Understanding the Problem:**

Two people board the elevator at the ground floor. The first person wants to go to the 10th floor, and the second person wants to go to the 30th floor. We need to find the total time it takes for both people to reach their respective floors.

**Approach:**

Since both people are boarding at the same time and the elevator will stop at both the 10th and 30th floors, we need to calculate the time taken for the elevator to go from the ground floor to the 30th floor, stopping at the 10th floor in between.

**Calculations:**

1. **From Ground Floor to 10th Floor:**
   - Number of floors: 10
   - Height per floor: 5 meters
   - Total height: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) meters

   **Elevator Motion:**
   - Acceleration Phase:
     - Time (\( t_1 \)) = 5 seconds
     - Distance (\( d_1 \)) = 12.5 meters
   - Constant Speed Phase:
     - Distance (\( d_2 \)) = 50 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 25 meters
     - Time (\( t_2 \)) = \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) seconds
   - Deceleration Phase:
     - Time (\( t_3 \)) = 5 seconds
     - Distance (\( d_3 \)) = 12.5 meters

   **Total Time to 10th Floor:**
   \[
   t_{\text{to 10}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **From 10th Floor to 30th Floor:**
   - Number of floors: 20
   - Total height: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) meters

   **Elevator Motion:**
   - Acceleration Phase:
     - Time (\( t_1 \)) = 5 seconds
     - Distance (\( d_1 \)) = 12.5 meters
   - Constant Speed Phase:
     - Distance (\( d_2 \)) = 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters
     - Time (\( t_2 \)) = \( \frac{75}{5} = 15 \) seconds
   - Deceleration Phase:
     - Time (\( t_3 \)) = 5 seconds
     - Distance (\( d_3 \)) = 12.5 meters

   **Total Time to 30th Floor:**
   \[
   t_{\text{to 30}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \text{ seconds}
   \]

**Total Time:**

\[
\text{Total time} = t_{\text{to 10}} + t_{\text{to 30}} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Answer to Question 2:**

It takes **40 seconds** for both people to reach their respective floors.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Understanding the Problem:**

Two people board the elevator at the ground floor. The first person wants to go to the 40th floor. The second person wants to go to another floor between the 1st and 40th floor. We need to find the minimum time it takes for the elevator to reach the 40th floor, stopping at another floor in between.

**Approach:**

To minimize the total time, the elevator should stop at the floor closest to the ground floor. This minimizes the additional distance and time added by the stop.
