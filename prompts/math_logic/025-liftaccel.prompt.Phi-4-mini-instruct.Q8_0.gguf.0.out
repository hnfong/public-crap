Let's solve each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor

1. **Total height to be covered:**
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Acceleration and maximum speed:**
   - Acceleration (\(a\)) = 1 m/sÂ²
   - Maximum speed (\(v_{\text{max}}\)) = 5 m/s

3. **Time to reach maximum speed:**
   \[
   v = u + at \implies 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \implies t = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \implies s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

6. **Time to cover remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

7. **Total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{time to accelerate} + \text{time at max speed} = 5 + 37.5 = 42.5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

### Question 2: Time for two people going to different floors

1. **First person to 10/F:**
   - Distance = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) meters

2. **Second person to 30/F:**
   - Distance = \(30 \times 5 = 150\) meters

3. **Time to reach maximum speed:**
   - For both, \(t = 5\) seconds

4. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   - For both, \(s = 12.5\) meters

5. **Remaining distance:**
   - First person: \(50 - 12.5 = 37.5\) meters
   - Second person: \(150 - 12.5 = 137.5\) meters

6. **Time to cover remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - First person: \(t = \frac{37.5}{5} = 7.5\) seconds
   - Second person: \(t = \frac{137.5}{5} = 27.5\) seconds

7. **Total time for each person:**
   - First person: \(5 + 7.5 = 12.5\) seconds
   - Second person: \(5 + 27.5 = 32.5\) seconds

### Question 3: Minimum time with a stop at another floor

1. **First person to 40/F:**
   - Distance = \(40 \times 5 = 200\) meters

2. **Second person stops at another floor (let's say 20/F):**
   - Distance to 20/F: \(20 \times 5 = 100\) meters
   - Distance from 20/F to 40/F: \(20 \times 5 = 100\) meters

3. **Time to reach maximum speed:**
   - For both, \(t = 5\) seconds

4. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   - For both, \(s = 12.5\) meters

5. **Remaining distance:**
   - First person: \(200 - 12.5 = 187.5\) meters
   - Second person: \(100 - 12.5 = 87.5\) meters (to 20/F)
   - Second person: \(100 - 12.5 = 87.5\) meters (from 20/F to 40/F)

6. **Time to cover remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - First person: \(t = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5\) seconds
   - Second person: \(t = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5\) seconds (to 20/F)
   - Second person: \(t = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5\) seconds (from 20/F to 40/F)

7. **Total time for each person:**
   - First person: \(5 + 37.5 = 42.5\) seconds
   - Second person: \(5 + 17.5 + 17.5 = 40\) seconds

8. **Minimum time:**
   - The minimum time is the time taken by the second person, which is 40 seconds. [end of text]
