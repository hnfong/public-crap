Here are the step-by-step solutions to your questions.

### **Preliminary Calculations & Constants**

Before solving the specific scenarios, let's establish the physical parameters of the elevator's motion.

*   **Floor Height:** $5$ meters.
*   **Acceleration ($a$):** $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
*   **Deceleration ($d$):** $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (magnitude).
*   **Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$):** $5 \, \text{m/s}$.

**Motion Profile Analysis:**
The elevator accelerates from rest to $v_{max}$, travels at constant speed (if the distance allows), and then decelerates to rest.

1.  **Time to reach max speed ($t_{acc}$):**
    $$v = a \cdot t \implies 5 = 1 \cdot t \implies t_{acc} = 5 \, \text{s}$$
2.  **Distance covered during acceleration ($d_{acc}$):**
    $$d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}$$
3.  **Distance covered during deceleration ($d_{dec}$):**
    Since deceleration magnitude equals acceleration, $d_{dec} = 12.5 \, \text{m}$.
    Time to stop ($t_{dec}$) is also $5 \, \text{s}$.

**Total distance required to reach max speed and stop:**
$$d_{total\_ramp} = d_{acc} + d_{dec} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}$$

**Logic for Travel Time:**
*   **Case A (Short Distance):** If the total distance $D < 25 \, \text{m}$, the elevator never reaches $5 \, \text{m/s}$. It accelerates halfway and decelerates the rest.
    *   Time $t = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{D}{a}}$.
*   **Case B (Long Distance):** If $D \ge 25 \, \text{m}$, the elevator accelerates, cruises at $5 \, \text{m/s}$, then decelerates.
    *   Time $t = t_{acc} + t_{cruise} + t_{dec}$.
    *   $t_{cruise} = \frac{D - 25}{5}$.
    *   Total $t = 5 + \frac{D - 25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{D - 25}{5}$.

### **Question 1: Ground Floor (1/F) to Top Floor (40/F)**

**Step 1: Calculate Total Distance**
The elevator travels from Floor 1 to Floor 40.
Number of floors traveled = $40 - 1 = 39$ floors.
Total Distance ($D$) = $39 \text{ floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 195 \, \text{m}$.

**Step 2: Determine Motion Profile**
Since $195 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m}$, the elevator will reach maximum speed.

**Step 3: Calculate Time Components**
*   **Acceleration Phase:** $5 \, \text{s}$ (covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$).
*   **Deceleration Phase:** $5 \, \text{s}$ (covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$).
*   **Cruising Distance:** $195 - 25 = 170 \, \text{m}$.
*   **Cruising Time:** $\frac{170 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 34 \, \text{s}$.

**Step 4: Total Time**
$$T = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{s}$$

**Answer 1:** It takes **44 seconds**.

### **Question 2: Two People (1/F to 10/F and 1/F to 30/F)**

**Scenario:** The lift starts at 1/F, stops at 10/F (to let the first person out), and then continues to 30/F (to let the second person out). We assume the lift stops completely at 10/F.

**Leg 1: 1/F to 10/F**
*   Floors traveled: $10 - 1 = 9$ floors.
*   Distance ($D_1$): $9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{m}$.
*   Since $45 > 25$, it reaches max speed.
*   Cruise distance: $45 - 25 = 20 \, \text{m}$.
*   Cruise time: $20 / 5 = 4 \, \text{s}$.
*   Time for Leg 1 ($T_1$): $5 \, (\text{acc}) + 4 \, (\text{cruise}) + 5 \, (\text{dec}) = 14 \, \text{s}$.

**Leg 2: 10/F to 30/F**
*   Floors traveled: $30 - 10 = 20$ floors.
*   Distance ($D_2$): $20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
*   Since $100 > 25$, it reaches max speed.
*   Cruise distance: $100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m}$.
*   Cruise time: $75 / 5 = 15 \, \text{s}$.
*   Time for Leg 2 ($T_2$): $5 \, (\text{acc}) + 15 \, (\text{cruise}) + 5 \, (\text{dec}) = 25 \, \text{s}$.

**Total Time**
$$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = 14 + 25 = 39 \, \text{s}$$

*(Note: This calculation assumes the time to open/close doors and the dwell time at the floor are negligible, as no specific door time was provided in the problem statement.)*

**Answer 2:** It takes **39 seconds**.

### **Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with One Intermediate Stop**

**Scenario:**
*   Start: 1/F.
*   End: 40/F.
*   Constraint: Must stop at exactly one intermediate floor ($F_{stop}$) where $1 < F_{stop} < 40$.
*   Goal: Minimize total time.

**Analysis:**
The total time is the sum of the time for Leg 1 (1/F to $F_{stop}$) and Leg 2 ($F_{stop}$ to 40/F).
$$T_{total} = T(1 \to F_{stop}) + T(F_{stop} \to 40)$$

Let $x$ be the number of floors in the first leg.
Then the second leg has $(39 - x)$ floors.
Distance 1 ($D_1$) = $5x$.
Distance 2 ($D_2$) = $5(39-x)$.

The function for time $T(D)$ for a distance $D \ge 25$ is:
$$T(D) = 10 + \frac{D - 25}{5} = 10 + \frac{D}{5} - 5 = 5 + \frac{D}{5}$$
*(Note: If $D < 25$, the time is $2\sqrt{D}$. However, since the total distance is 195m, splitting it into two legs will likely result in both legs being long enough to hit max speed, or at least one being very long. Let's check the threshold.)*

Threshold distance for max speed is $25 \, \text{m}$ (5 floors).
If we stop at floor 6 ($x=5$), $D_1 = 25 \, \text{m}$.
If we stop at floor 35 ($x=34$), $D_2 = 5 \times 5 = 25 \, \text{m}$.

**Case A: Both legs are $\ge 25$ meters (5 floors)**
If both legs allow the elevator to reach max speed, the time function is linear:
$$T_{total} = (5 + \frac{D_1}{5}) + (5 + \frac{D_2}{5}) = 10 + \frac{D_1 + D_2}{5}$$
Since $D_1 + D_2 = 195$ (constant total distance):
$$T_{total} = 10 + \frac{195}{5} = 10 + 39 = 49 \, \text{s}$$
In this scenario, the location of the stop **does not matter** as long as both segments are long enough to reach max speed. The time is constant at 49s.

**Case B: One leg is $< 25$ meters**
If we stop very close to the start or end, one leg will be short ($< 25$m).
Let's test the extreme: Stop at Floor 2 ($x=1$).
*   $D_1 = 5 \, \text{m}$.
    *   $D_1 < 25$, so use $t = 2\sqrt{D/a} = 2\sqrt{5/1} \approx 4.47 \, \text{s}$.
*   $D_2 = 190 \, \text{m}$.
    *   $D_2 > 25$, so use $t = 5 + 190/5 = 5 + 38 = 43 \, \text{s}$.
*   Total: $4.47 + 43 = 47.47 \, \text{s}$.

Wait, this is **faster** than 49s. Why?
Because the "penalty" of stopping (accelerating and decelerating) is fixed at 10s per leg (5s acc + 5s dec).
In the single trip (Q1), we paid the acceleration/deceleration penalty **once** (10s total).
In the two-leg trip, we pay the penalty **twice** (20s total).
However, the cruising speed is constant.
Let's re-evaluate the math.

**Re-evaluating the Time Function:**
Single trip (195m):
$T = 5 (\text{acc}) + 34 (\text{cruise}) + 5 (\text{dec}) = 44 \, \text{s}$.

Two trips (Split into $D_1, D_2$):
If both $D_1, D_2 \ge 25$:
$T = (5 + \frac{D_1-25}{5} + 5) + (5 + \frac{D_2-25}{5} + 5)$
$T = 10 + \frac{D_1}{5} - 5 + 10 + \frac{D_2}{5} - 5$
$T = 10 + \frac{D_1+D_2}{5} = 10 + 39 = 49 \, \text{s}$.
This is $5$ seconds slower than the single trip. This makes sense: we lost 5 seconds of cruising time because we had to decelerate and accelerate again.

If one leg is short ($D < 25$):
Let $D_1 < 25$. Time $t_1 = 2\sqrt{D_1}$.
Let $D_2 = 195 - D_1$. Since $D_1$ is small, $D_2$ is large ($>25$).
Time $t_2 = 5 + \frac{D_2 - 25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{195 - D_1 - 25}{5} = 10 + \frac{170 - D_1}{5} = 10 + 34 - \frac{D_1}{5} = 44 - \frac{D_1}{5}$.
Total Time $T(D_1) = 2\sqrt{D_1} + 44 - \frac{D_1}{5}$.

We want to minimize $f(D_1) = 2\sqrt{D_1} - 0.2 D_1 + 44$.
Let's find the derivative with respect to $D_1$:
$f'(D_1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D_1}} - 0.2$.
Set to 0: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{D_1}} = 0.2 \implies \sqrt{D_1} = 5 \implies D_1 = 25$.
At $D_1 = 25$, the derivative is 0.
For $D_1 < 25$, $\sqrt{D_1} < 5$, so $\frac{1}{\sqrt{D_1}} > 0.2$. The derivative is positive.
This means the function is **increasing** as $D_1$ increases from 0 to 25.
Therefore, to minimize time, we want $D_1$ to be as **small** as possible.

**Constraint Check:**
The stop must be at a floor between 1/F and 40/F.
The smallest possible distance for the first leg is 1 floor (1/F to 2/F).
$D_1 = 5 \, \text{m}$.

**Calculation for Minimum Time:**
1.  **Leg 1 (1/F to 2/F):**
    *   Distance $D_1 = 5 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Since $5 < 25$, max speed is not reached.
    *   Time $t_1 = 2\sqrt{\frac{5}{1}} = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.472 \, \text{s}$.
2.  **Leg 2 (2/F to 40/F):**
    *   Distance $D_2 = 195 - 5 = 190 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Since $190 > 25$, max speed is reached.
    *   Time $t_2 = 5 (\text{acc}) + \frac{190 - 25}{5} (\text{cruise}) + 5 (\text{dec})$.
    *   $t_2 = 10 + \frac{165}{5} = 10 + 33 = 43 \, \text{s}$.
3.  **Total Time:**
    *   $T = 4.472 + 43 = 47.472 \, \text{s}$.

Let's double check if stopping at the very end (39/F to 40/F) yields the same result.
Leg 1: 1/F to 39/F ($D=190$). Time = 43s.
Leg 2: 39/F to 40/F ($D=5$). Time = 4.472s.
Total = 47.472s.

Is there any scenario where stopping at a floor where *both* legs are short helps?
No, because the total distance is 195m. You cannot have two legs both $< 25$m.

**Conclusion:**
The minimum time occurs when the intermediate stop is as close to the start or end as possible (1 floor away), minimizing the distance traveled at the "inefficient" acceleration/deceleration phase of the short leg, while maximizing the distance of the long leg which utilizes the high cruising speed.

**Answer 3:** The minimum time is approximately **47.47 seconds** (specifically $43 + 2\sqrt{5}$ seconds).
