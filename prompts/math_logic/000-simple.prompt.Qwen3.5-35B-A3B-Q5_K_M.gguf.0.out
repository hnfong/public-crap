**Q12:** Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
*   This depends on how much cake Tom wants to serve. However, a standard assumption for a party question is one slice per person.

*   If counting everyone (Tom + 5 guests): 6 slices.
*   *Note: Without knowing if Tom eats cake or how many slices per person, there is no single mathematical answer, but typically the answer is based on the number of people present.*
