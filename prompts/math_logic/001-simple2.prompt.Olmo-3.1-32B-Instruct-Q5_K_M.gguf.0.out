### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Step 1: Identify basic properties**
- 120 is a natural number.
- It is an even number and divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

**Step 2: Special mathematical properties**
- **Factorial:** 120 = 5! (5 factorial) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
- **Highly composite number:** 120 has more divisors than any smaller number except 1, 2, 6, 24, and 60.
    - Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors)
- **Sum of consecutive integers:** 120 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers in several ways, e.g., 4 + 5 + 6 + ... + 15 = 120
- **Geometry:** 
    - A dodecahedron has 120 edges.
    - There are 120 degrees in a third of a full circle (since 360/3 = 120).
- **Time:** 
    - There are 120 minutes in 2 hours.
    - In some contexts, 120 is used as a standard value (e.g., 120 beats per minute in music).
- **Chemistry:** 
    - The atomic number of ununbium (now oganesson, but historically relevant) was 120 (though now the periodic table has gone beyond).
- **Other:** 
    - 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 objects taken 3 at a time (permutations: P(5,3) = 60, but combinations and other arrangements may relate to 120 in some contexts).

**Summary:**  
120 is significant as 5 factorial, a highly composite number with many divisors, and appears in geometry, time measurement, and combinatorics.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Step 1: Write the equation**
x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Step 2: Try factoring**
We look for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Let’s list factor pairs of -18:
- 1 and -18 → 1 + (-18) = -17
- -1 and 18 → -1 + 18 = 17
- 2 and -9 → 2 + (-9) = -7 ← This works!
- -2 and 9 → -2 + 9 = 7

So, we can factor as:
(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Check:
(x - 9)(x + 2) = x² + 2x - 9x - 18 = x² - 7x - 18 ✔️

**Step 3: Set each factor to zero**
x - 9 = 0 → x = 9  
x + 2 = 0 → x = -2

**Step 4: Final answer**
The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Step 1: Calculate one-way trip time**
Distance = 200 km  
Speed = 60 km/h  
Time (one way) = Distance / Speed = 200 / 60 = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours

**Step 2: Calculate round trip time**
A round trip is going and coming back, so:
Time (round trip) = 2 × (200 / 60) = 2 × (10/3) = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours

**Step 3: Total time available in a day**
A full day = 24 hours

**Step 4: Calculate number of round trips**
Number of round trips = Total time available / Time per round trip  
= 24 / (20/3)  
= 24 × (3/20)  
= (24 × 3) / 20  
= 72 / 20  
= 3.6

But you can't do a fraction of a trip if you require the trip to be completed. So, the train can complete 3 full round trips in 24 hours.

Let’s check the time for 3 round trips:
3 × (20/3) = 20 hours

Time left after 3 round trips = 24 - 20 = 4 hours

Can it do another round trip?  
Time needed for one more round trip = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 hours  
But only 4 hours are left, which is not enough.

**Therefore, the train can make 3 full round trips in a day.**

**Final Answers:**

Q1: 120 is significant as it is 5 factorial (5!), a highly composite number with 16 divisors, and appears in geometry (e.g., dodecahedron edges), time (120 minutes = 2 hours), and combinatorics.  
Q2: The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.  
Q3: The train can make 3 full round trips in a day. [end of text]
