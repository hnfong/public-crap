Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) + 1 = 4 * 4 + 1 = 17, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 3) * (8 - 1) = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * 3 + 1 = 4 * 3 + 1 = 13, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) / (3 + 1) * 3 = 12 / 4 * 3 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 / 4) * (3 * 1) + 4 = 2 * 3 + 4 = 10, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) / (4 - 1) + 4 = 24 / 3 + 4 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) / (3 - 1) * 3 = 12 / 2 * 3 = 18, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 4) / (3 + 1) + 1 = 32 / 4 + 1 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 4 * 1 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 4) / (3 + 1) - 1 = 32 / 4 - 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) / (3 * 1) * 3 = 12 / 3 * 3 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 3) + 1 * 4 = 8 * 1 + 4 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) / (4 - 1) * 1 = 24 / 3 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) * 1 = 12 * 2 * 1 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) * 1 = 12 * 2 * 1 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Correct!
