Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
2. It is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
3. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
4. It is the sum of the first 15 positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120).
5. It is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61 = 120).
6. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the product of five distinct prime numbers (2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 = 2310).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip and then divide the total available time by that duration.

Time for one trip = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)
Time for one round trip = 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours (approximately)

A full day has 24 hours, so the number of round trips the train can make is:

Number of round trips = Total available time / Time for one round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
