"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement is a classic example of a mnemonic device, specifically a mnemonic device for remembering the conversion between Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Here's how it works:

1. The first step is to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. This involves subtracting 32°F from the original temperature.
2. The second step is to invert the digits of the Celsius temperature. This means adding 12°F to the original temperature.
3. Finally, the third step is to add the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature. This means adding 12°F to the original temperature.

By following these steps, we can easily remember that:

* 12°C is equivalent to 32°F
* 12°F is equivalent to 32°C
* 12°C + 12°F = 32°C
* 12°F + 12°C = 32°C

This mnemonic device helps us remember the conversion between Celsius to Fahrenheit by associating the original temperature with the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. [end of text]
