Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. The meaning of the number 120 is that it is the sum of the squares of the first 10 numbers from 1 to 100.

2. The equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be solved by dividing both sides by 6, getting x = -0.5 and then using the quadratic formula x = (b - sqrt(a))/2, where a and b are the roots of the quadratic equation.

3. The train can make round trip between the two cities within a full day by taking 200 km as the distance and assuming the time taken for one trip is negligible (less than 1 minute), and taking 1 hour to travel between the cities, for a total of 3 hours.

You can give the answers for each question with clear and concise language, but be sure to provide a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem. If you are not sure about the answer, you can provide an alternative solution or explain why the given solution is incorrect.
