There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To find the time it takes for the lift to travel from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration phase, the constant speed phase, and the deceleration phase.

- Acceleration phase: The lift starts from rest and accelerates to its maximum speed of 5 m/s. The distance covered during this phase can be calculated using the formula $d = \frac{1}{2}at^2$, where $d$ is the distance, $a$ is the acceleration, and $t$ is the time. In this case, $d = 5 \times 5 = 25$ meters, and $a = 1$ m/s^2. Solving for $t$ gives us the time taken for the acceleration phase.

- Constant speed phase: Once the lift reaches its maximum speed, it travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s. The distance covered during this phase is simply the distance from the end of the acceleration phase to the top floor, which is $40 \times 5 = 200$ meters.

- Deceleration phase: Finally, the lift decelerates to a stop at the top floor. The distance covered during this phase is the same as the acceleration phase, which is 25 meters.

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for each phase. Let's calculate the time for each phase and then find the total time.

Acceleration phase:
$$t_{acceleration} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 25}{1}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071 \text{ seconds}$$

Constant speed phase:
$$t_{constant} = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \text{ seconds}$$

Deceleration phase:
$$t_{deceleration} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 25}{1}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071 \text{ seconds}$$

Total time:
$$t_{total} = t_{acceleration} + t_{constant} + t_{deceleration} = 7.071 + 40 + 7.071 = 54.142 \text{ seconds}$$

So, it takes approximately 54.142 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. For the two people getting on the lift on the ground floor, we need to consider the time taken for each person to reach their respective floors.

- First person: The first person goes to the 10th floor. The distance covered is $10 \times 5 = 50$ meters. The time taken for this person to reach the 10th floor is the same as the time taken for the lift to travel from the ground floor to the 10th floor.

- Second person: The second person goes to the 30th floor. The distance covered is $30 \times 5 = 150$ meters. The time taken for this person to reach the 30th floor is the same as the time taken for the lift to travel from the ground floor to the 30th floor.

Let's calculate the time taken for each person.

First person:
$$t_{first} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 50}{1}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071 \text{ seconds}$$

Second person:
$$t_{second} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 150}{1}} = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.142 \text{ seconds}$$

The total time taken for both people is the maximum of the times taken by each person.

$$t_{total} = \max(t_{first}, t_{second}) = \max(7.071, 14.142) = 14.142 \text{ seconds}$$

So, it takes approximately 14.142 seconds for both people to reach their respective floors.

3. For the second person to reach the 40th floor, we need to consider the minimum time taken for the lift to reach the 40th floor, assuming it has to stop at another floor between the 1st and 40th floors.

- The lift starts from the ground floor and accelerates to its maximum speed of 5 m/s. The distance covered during this phase is 25 meters.

- Once the lift reaches its maximum speed, it travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s. The distance covered during this phase is the distance from the end of the acceleration phase to the 40th floor, which is $40 \times 5 = 200$ meters.

- The lift then decelerates to a stop at the 40th floor. The distance covered during this phase is the same as the acceleration phase, which is 25 meters.

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for each phase. Let's calculate the time for each phase and then find the total time.

Acceleration phase:
$$t_{acceleration} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 25}{1}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071 \text{ seconds}$$

Constant speed phase:
$$t_{constant} = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \text{ seconds}$$

Deceleration phase:
$$t_{deceleration} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 25}{1}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071 \text{ seconds}$$

Total time:
$$t_{total} = t_{acceleration} + t_{constant} + t_{deceleration} = 7.071 + 40 + 7.071 = 54.142 \text{ seconds}$$

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor if it has to stop at another floor between the 1st and 40th floors is approximately 54.142 seconds.
