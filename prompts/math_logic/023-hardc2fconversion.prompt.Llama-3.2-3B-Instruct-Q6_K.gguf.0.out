"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

I think I understand what this means, but I'd like to clarify and provide examples to ensure I'm correct.

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Here's how it works:

* Every 12°C, the digits are inverted, meaning that the tens digit is swapped with the ones digit.

Let's take a few examples to illustrate this:

* 12°C: 12°C = 53.6°F (no inversion needed)
* 13°C: 13°C = 55.4°F (no inversion needed)
* 14°C: 14°C = 57.2°F (no inversion needed)
* 15°C: 15°C = 59°F (inversion: 15 becomes 59)
* 16°C: 16°C = 60.8°F (inversion: 16 becomes 68)
* 17°C: 17°C = 62.6°F (inversion: 17 becomes 62)
* 18°C: 18°C = 64.4°F (inversion: 18 becomes 64)
* 19°C: 19°C = 66.2°F (inversion: 19 becomes 62)
* 20°C: 20°C = 68°F (no inversion needed)

As you can see, every 12°C, the tens digit is swapped with the ones digit. This pattern continues for the rest of the Celsius scale.

I hope this explanation and examples help clarify the meaning of the statement! [end of text]
