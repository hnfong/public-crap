The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is a **mnemonic device** (a memory trick), not a precise mathematical formula.

It means that if you take a specific temperature in Celsius where the digits are $X$ and $Y$ (forming the number $XY$), and you add roughly **12 degrees**, the resulting Fahrenheit temperature will often look like the digits swapped ($YX$).

This works surprisingly well for a specific range of temperatures because the ratio between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales is close to the ratio needed for this digit swap to occur numerically.

### How the Math Works (Roughly)
The exact formula is: $F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$.
The trick relies on the fact that $1.8 \approx 2$, and the offset of $32$ interacts with the numbers in a way that creates these "mirror" pairs every ~11.1 degrees (which the trick rounds to **12** for easy remembering).

### Examples

Here are the most common pairs where this trick works:

#### Example 1: The 16°C / 61°F Pair
*   **Celsius:** $16^\circ\text{C}$
*   **Add ~12:** $16 + 12 = 28$ (This part of the rule is slightly loose; the real magic is just finding the pair).
*   **The Inversion:** Take the digits of **16** and swap them $\rightarrow$ **61**.
*   **Check the Real Math:**
    $$F = (16 \times 1.8) + 32$$
    $$F = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8^\circ\text{F}$$
*   **Result:** $60.8$ is extremely close to **61**.
    *   *Memory aid:* "16 Celsius is roughly 61 Fahrenheit."

#### Example 2: The 28°C / 82°F Pair
*   **Celsius:** $28^\circ\text{C}$ (Notice $28$ is $12$ degrees higher than $16$).
*   **The Inversion:** Take the digits of **28** and swap them $\rightarrow$ **82**.
*   **Check the Real Math:**
    $$F = (28 \times 1.8) + 32$$
    $$F = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4^\circ\text{F}$$
*   **Result:** $82.4$ is very close to **82**.
    *   *Memory aid:* "28 Celsius is roughly 82 Fahrenheit."

#### Example 3: The 04°C / 40°F Pair
*   **Celsius:** $4^\circ\text{C}$ (Written as **04** to keep two digits).
*   **The Inversion:** Swap **04** $\rightarrow$ **40**.
*   **Check the Real Math:**
    $$F = (4 \times 1.8) + 32$$
    $$F = 7.2 + 32 = 39.2^\circ\text{F}$$
*   **Result:** $39.2$ is close to **40**.

### Why "Every 12°C"?
The trick says "every 12°C" because the gap between these "magic pairs" is roughly 11.1 degrees.
*   $16^\circ\text{C} \rightarrow 61^\circ\text{F}$
*   $28^\circ\text{C} \rightarrow 82^\circ\text{F}$ (Difference is $12^\circ\text{C}$)
*   $40^\circ\text{C} \rightarrow 104^\circ\text{F}$ (Here the trick breaks because the digits become three numbers, but $40+12=52$, and $52$ inverted is $25$, which doesn't work. The pattern usually stops being useful after 28°C).

### Limitations
This is **not** accurate for scientific calculations.
*   **At 32°C:** Inverting gives 23. Real math: $(32 \times 1.8) + 32 = 89.6^\circ\text{F}$. The trick fails completely here.
*   **Precision:** It usually has an error margin of about $1^\circ\text{F}$ to $2^\circ\text{F}$.

### Summary
The phrase is a shortcut for travelers or casual conversation. It tells you that if you know **16°C is 61°F**, you can estimate that **28°C is 82°F** simply by adding 12 to the Celsius side and flipping the digits on the Fahrenheit side. It is a pattern recognition tool, not a calculation method. [end of text]
