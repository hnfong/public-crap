The statement you provided is **incorrect** and likely a misunderstanding or a misremembered mnemonic.

**There is no rule in temperature conversion where "every 12°C, the digits are inverted."**

If we test this rule with actual math, it fails immediately:
*   **The Claim:** If you start at a certain temperature and add 12°C, the Fahrenheit digits should be the reverse of the Celsius digits (or the previous Fahrenheit digits).
*   **The Reality:** The relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) is linear but involves a slope of 1.8 (or 9/5) and an offset of 32. The formula is:
    $$F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$$

Let's look at why that specific quote is wrong and then provide the **actual** easy ways to remember the conversion.

### 1. Why the "12°C Inversion" Rule is Wrong

Let's try to find a pattern where adding 12°C results in inverted digits.

*   **Test Case A:** Start at **12°C**.
    *   Calculation: $(12 \times 1.8) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F$.
    *   Digits of Celsius: `1`, `2`.
    *   Digits of Fahrenheit: `5`, `3`.
    *   *Result:* Not inverted.

*   **Test Case B:** Let's assume the quote meant "At specific intervals, the numbers look like reverses of each other."
    *   Is there a time when $16°C$ equals $61°F$?
        *   $16°C \rightarrow (16 \times 1.8) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8°F$ (Close to 61, but not exact).
    *   Is there a time when $24°C$ equals $42°F$?
        *   $24°C \rightarrow (24 \times 1.8) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F$ (Nowhere near 42).

**Conclusion:** The quote is factually false. It might be a confusion with a specific coincidence (like 16°C ≈ 61°F) that someone incorrectly generalized into a rule about "every 12 degrees."

### 2. The Real "Easy Ways" to Remember (With Examples)

Since the quote you found is unreliable, here are three **correct** and proven methods to estimate or calculate the conversion.

#### Method A: The "Double and Add 30" Rule (Best for Quick Estimates)
This is the most common mental shortcut. It isn't perfect, but it gets you very close for everyday weather temperatures.
*   **Formula:** $F \approx (C \times 2) + 30$
*   **Exact Formula:** $F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$

**Examples:**
1.  **20°C** (Room temperature)
    *   *Estimate:* $20 \times 2 = 40$. $40 + 30 = \mathbf{70°F}$.
    *   *Exact:* $(20 \times 1.8) + 32 = 36 + 32 = \mathbf{68°F}$.
    *   *Verdict:* Very close!

2.  **30°C** (Hot day)
    *   *Estimate:* $30 \times 2 = 60$. $60 + 30 = \mathbf{90°F}$.
    *   *Exact:* $(30 \times 1.8) + 32 = 54 + 32 = \mathbf{86°F}$.
    *   *Verdict:* Close enough to know you need AC.

3.  **10°C** (Cool day)
    *   *Estimate:* $10 \times 2 = 20$. $20 + 30 = \mathbf{50°F}$.
    *   *Exact:* $(10 \times 1.8) + 32 = 18 + 32 = \mathbf{50°F}$.
    *   *Verdict:* Perfect match at this specific number.

#### Method B: The "Key Anchor Points" (Best for Memory)
Instead of a formula, just memorize these four critical numbers. You can estimate anything in between.

| Celsius (°C) | Fahrenheit (°F) | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **-40** | **-40** | The only time they are exactly equal. |
| **0** | **32** | Water freezes. |
| **10** | **50** | Cool day. |
| **20** | **68** | Room temperature (often rounded to 70). |
| **30** | **86** | Hot day (often rounded to 90). |
| **40** | **104** | Very hot. |
| **100** | **212** | Water boils. |

**How to use it:**
If someone says it's **25°C**, you know it's halfway between 20°C (68°F) and 30°C (86°F). The average of 68 and 86 is roughly **77°F**.
*(Exact math: $25 \times 1.8 + 32 = 77°F$. The estimation works perfectly.)*

#### Method C: The "Subtract 32, Divide by 2, Add 10%" (Reverse Conversion)
If you need to go from Fahrenheit to Celsius mentally:
1.  Subtract 32.
2.  Divide by 2.
3.  Add 10% of that result back.

**Example: Convert 77°F to Celsius**
1.  $77 - 32 = 45$
2.  $45 / 2 = 22.5$
3.  10% of 22.5 is roughly $2.25$.
4.  $22.5 + 2.25 = 24.75$ (Rounds to **25°C**).

### Summary
Please discard the quote about "every 12°C, digits are inverted." It is a myth.

*   **For speed:** Use **Double + 30**.
*   **For accuracy:** Memorize **0°C=32°F**, **20°C=68°F**, and **30°C=86°F**.
*   **For fun fact:** Remember **-40°** is the same in both scales. [end of text]
