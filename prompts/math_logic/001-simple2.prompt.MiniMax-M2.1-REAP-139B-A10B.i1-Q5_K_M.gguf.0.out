**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 is a highly composite number with many interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! (5 factorial = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120). This makes it the smallest number that is a factorial of a number greater than 4.

2. **Highly Composite**: 120 has more divisors (16) than any smaller number. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

3. **Triangular Number**: 120 = 15 × 16 / 2, so it's the 15th triangular number.

4. **Practical Number**: 120 is a practical number, meaning every smaller positive integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of 120.

5. **Abundant Number**: The sum of its proper divisors (1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 240) is greater than 120 itself.

6. **Binomial Coefficient**: 120 = C(16,2) = 16 choose 2, representing the number of ways to choose 2 items from 16.

7. **Seconds in Two Minutes**: There are exactly 120 seconds in two minutes.

8. **Days in a Work Week**: Some countries use a 5-day work week with 6 days of work per week (120 hours).

9. **Cardinality**: A standard deck of playing cards has 120 possible ways to arrange 5 cards.

10. **In Mathematics**: 120 appears in many combinatorial and probability calculations due to its factorial nature.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, I can factor it:

**Step 1**: Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

The numbers are -9 and +2:
- (-9) × (+2) = -18
- (-9) + (+2) = -7

**Step 2**: Write the equation in factored form:
x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

**Step 3**: Set each factor equal to zero:
- x - 9 = 0 → x = 9
- x + 2 = 0 → x = -2

**Answer**: x = 9 or x = -2

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible. How many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1**: Calculate the distance of one round trip.
- One way: 200 km
- Round trip (there and back): 200 × 2 = 400 km

**Step 2**: Calculate the time for one round trip.
- Speed = 60 km/h
- Time = Distance ÷ Speed
- Time for one round trip = 400 km ÷ 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes)

**Step 3**: Calculate how many round trips fit in one day (24 hours).
- Number of round trips = 24 hours ÷ 6.67 hours per trip
- 24 ÷ (400/60) = 24 × (60/400) = 24 × 0.15 = 3.6

**Answer**: The train can make 3 complete round trips in one day (with 0.6 of a trip remaining, which isn't enough for a fourth complete trip).

I am not sure, but I think the answer is **3 complete round trips**.
