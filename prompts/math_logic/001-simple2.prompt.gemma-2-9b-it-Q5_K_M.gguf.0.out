Here are the answers and explanations:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

* **Significance:** 120 doesn't have a single, universally recognized significance like some numbers (e.g., pi, 0). However, it appears in various contexts:
    * **Mathematics:** It's a highly composite number (many divisors), a multiple of 10, 12, and 20, and a factorial (120 = 5!).
    * **Nature:**  There are 120 degrees in two right angles.
    * **Culture:**  In some cultures, 120 holds symbolic meaning related to cycles or completeness.

* **Interesting Properties:**
    * **Highly Composite:** It has more divisors than any smaller number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).
    * **Factorial:** 120 = 5! (5 factorial), meaning 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
    * **Triangular Number:** It's the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring:

1. **Find two numbers that add up to -7 and multiply to -18.** These numbers are -9 and 2.

2. **Rewrite the equation using these numbers:** (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

3. **Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:**
   * x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
   * x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

**Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   * Time for one way: Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours
   * Time for round trip: 3.33 hours * 2 = 6.66 hours

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in a day:**
   * Hours in a day: 24 hours
   * Number of round trips: 24 hours / 6.66 hours/trip â‰ˆ 3.6

**Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, it can make a maximum of 3 complete round trips within a full day.**
