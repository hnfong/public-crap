I'll attempt to answer all the questions step by step.

**Question 1: Time to reach the top floor (40/F)**

First, let's calculate the total distance the lift needs to travel:
40 floors × 5 meters/floor = 200 meters

Since the lift accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s^2, we can assume a triangular velocity profile. The maximum speed is 5 m/s.

To find the time to reach the top floor, we can use the equation:
Time = Distance / Average Speed

The average speed is half of the maximum speed, since the lift accelerates and decelerates symmetrically:
Average Speed = (0 + 5 m/s) / 2 = 2.5 m/s

Now, we can calculate the time:
Time = 200 meters / 2.5 m/s = 80 seconds

However, this is not the total time, as the lift needs to accelerate and decelerate. We need to add the time spent accelerating and decelerating.

Time to accelerate to 5 m/s:
a = 1 m/s^2, v = 5 m/s, u = 0 m/s
t_accel = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2 = 5 seconds

Time to decelerate from 5 m/s:
a = -1 m/s^2, v = 0 m/s, u = 5 m/s
t_decel = -u / a = -5 m/s / -1 m/s^2 = 5 seconds

Total time = Time + t_accel + t_decel = 80 seconds + 5 seconds + 5 seconds = 90 seconds

**Answer 1:** 90 seconds

**Question 2: Time for two people to reach their respective floors (10/F and 30/F)**

Let's analyze the journey:

1. The lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s (5 seconds).
2. The lift travels at 5 m/s until it reaches the 10th floor (10 floors × 5 meters/floor = 50 meters, time = 50 meters / 5 m/s = 10 seconds).
3. The lift decelerates to 0 m/s at the 10th floor (5 seconds).
4. The lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s again (5 seconds).
5. The lift travels at 5 m/s until it reaches the 30th floor (20 floors × 5 meters/floor = 100 meters, time = 100 meters / 5 m/s = 20 seconds).
6. The lift decelerates to 0 m/s at the 30th floor (5 seconds).

Total time = 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 5 = 50 seconds

**Answer 2:** 50 seconds

**Question 3: Minimum time to reach 40/F with an intermediate stop**

To minimize the time, the intermediate stop should be as close to the 40th floor as possible. Let's assume the intermediate stop is at the 39th floor.

The journey:

1. The lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s (5 seconds).
2. The lift travels at 5 m/s until it reaches the 39th floor (39 floors × 5 meters/floor = 195 meters, time = 195 meters / 5 m/s = 39 seconds).
3. The lift decelerates to 0 m/s at the 39th floor (5 seconds).
4. The lift accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s again (5 seconds).
5. The lift travels at 5 m/s until it reaches the 40th floor (1 floor × 5 meters/floor = 5 meters, time = 5 meters / 5 m/s = 1 second).
6. The lift decelerates to 0 m/s at the 40th floor (5 seconds).

Total time = 5 + 39 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 60 seconds

**Answer 3:** 60 seconds [end of text]
