Here are the step-by-step solutions to the given questions:

1. Q1: 1+1=2
   This is a simple addition problem. When you add 1 and 1, you get 2.

2. Q2: 6*7=42
   This is a multiplication problem. When you multiply 6 by 7, you get 42.

3. Q3: 83*59=4927
   This is another multiplication problem. When you multiply 83 by 59, you get 4927.

4. Q4: 349*683=239397
   This is a multiplication problem. When you multiply 349 by 683, you get 239397.

5. Q5: 6043*7489=4536297
   This is a multiplication problem. When you multiply 6043 by 7489, you get 4536297.

6. Q6: 3x + 7 = 22
   To solve this equation, you need to isolate the variable x. Here's how you can do it step by step:
   Step 1: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15
   Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 15 / 3 = 5
   So, the solution to the equation is x = 5.

7. Q7: 25% of 80 is 20
   To find 25% of 80, you can multiply 80 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). So, 25% of 80 is 80 * 0.25 = 20.

8. Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   First, calculate the total amount of money you gave the shopkeeper: 2 * 20 = 40 dollars. Then, subtract the cost of the book: 40 - 15 = 25 dollars. Since you gave the shopkeeper an additional five-dollar bill, her final change should be 25 - 5 = 20 dollars. So, the shopkeeper should give you 20 dollars in change.

9. Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal in length, you can find the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4. So, the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 5 * 4 = 20 units.

10. Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
    Since Katherine has two brothers and a sister, she is one of the four children. So, her mother has 4 children.

11. Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
    First, calculate the result of the division operation: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction operations: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So, the value of the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 is 5.

12. Q12: They need 5 slices of birthday cake.
    To determine how many slices of birthday cake they need, divide the total number of guests (5) by the number of slices per person. In this case, since each person needs 1 slice of cake, they will need 5 slices in total.

13. Q13: The sale price of the shirt is $20.
    To find the sale price of the shirt, multiply the original price ($25) by the discount percentage (20%). Since 20% can be written as 0.20 (as a decimal), the sale price is 25 * 0.20 = 5. So, the sale price of the shirt is $20.

14. Q14: There are 90 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
    To calculate the number of minutes left until 6:30 PM, subtract the current time (3:45 PM) from the desired time (6:30 PM). First, convert the time to minutes: 3:45 is 3 * 60 + 45 = 225 minutes, and 6:30 is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. Then, subtract 225 from 360 to find the number of minutes left: 360 - 225 = 90. So, there are 90 minutes left until 6:30 PM.

15. Q15: You need 6 taxis to carry 22 people.
    To determine how many taxis you need to carry a group of 22 people, divide the total number of people (22) by the number of people each taxi can carry (4). Since each taxi can carry 4 people, you will need 6 taxis in total to carry the group.

16. Q16: The measure of the third angle is 87 degrees.
    In a triangle, the sum of all three angles is always 180 degrees. Given that the first two angles measure 31 degrees and 62 degrees, you can calculate the measure of the third angle by subtracting the sum of the other two angles from 180: 180 - (31 + 62) = 87. So, the measure of the third angle is 87 degrees.

These are the step-by-step solutions to the given questions. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification.

6. Q6: 3x + 7 = 22
   To solve this equation, you need to isolate the variable x. Here's how you can do it step by step:
   Step 1: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15
   Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 15 / 3 = 5

7. Q7: 25% of 80 is 20
   To find 25% of 80, you can multiply 80 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). So, 25% of 80 is 80 * 0.25 = 20. The solution is 20.

8. Q8: The final change the shopkeeper should give you is $5
   To calculate the final change the shopkeeper should give you, follow these steps:
   Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money you gave the shopkeeper: 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.
   Step 2: Subtract the cost of the book: 40 - 15 = 25 dollars.
   Step 3: Since you gave the shopkeeper an additional five-dollar bill, her final change should be 25 - 5 = 20 dollars.
   The final change the shopkeeper should give you is $5.

9. Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units.
   To find the perimeter of a square, you can multiply the length of one side by the number of sides (which is 4 for a square). In this case, the side length is 5 units, so the perimeter is 5 * 4 = 20 units. The solution is 20.

10. Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
    Since Katherine has two brothers and a sister, she is one of the four children. So, her mother has 4 children. The solution is 4.

11. Q11: The expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 evaluates to 7.
    Here's the step-by-step calculation:
    Step 1: Calculate the result of the division operation: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.
    Step 2: Perform the addition and subtraction operations: 3 + 3 - 1 = 7.
    The expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 evaluates to 7. The solution is 7.

12. Q12: They need 5 slices of birthday cake.
    To determine how many slices of birthday cake they need, divide the total number of guests (5) by the number of slices per person. In this case, since each person needs 1 slice of cake, they will need 5 slices in total. The solution is 5.

13. Q13: The sale price of the shirt is $20.
    To find the sale price of the shirt, multiply the original price ($25) by the discount percentage (20%). Since 20% can be written as 0.20 (as a decimal), the
