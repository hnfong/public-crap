Let's solve the questions step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- The building has **40 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters tall**.
- The **lift/elevator** goes from the **ground floor (1/F)** to the **top floor (40/F)**.
- The **acceleration/deceleration** is **1 m/s²**.
- The **maximum speed** is **5 m/s**.

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

### **Step 1: Total distance**
- There are 40 floors, but the elevator starts at the **ground floor (1/F)** and goes to the **40th floor**.
- So, the elevator travels **39 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters**, so the total distance is:
  $$
  39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
  $$

### **Step 2: Time to accelerate to maximum speed**
- The elevator starts from rest and accelerates at **1 m/s²** until it reaches **5 m/s**.
- Use the formula:
  $$
  v = u + at
  $$
  where:
  - $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $
  - $ u = 0 \, \text{m/s} $
  - $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $

  Solve for $ t $:
  $$
  5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \Rightarrow t = 5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 3: Distance covered during acceleration**
- Use the formula:
  $$
  s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
  $$
  $$
  s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 25 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
  $$

### **Step 4: Time at maximum speed**
- The elevator travels the remaining distance at **5 m/s**.
- Remaining distance:
  $$
  195 - 12.5 = 182.5 \, \text{meters}
  $$
- Time at maximum speed:
  $$
  \frac{182.5}{5} = 36.5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 5: Time to decelerate to stop**
- The elevator decelerates at **1 m/s²** to stop.
- Time to decelerate is the same as the time to accelerate:
  $$
  t = 5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 6: Total time**
- Total time:
  $$
  5 + 36.5 + 5 = 46.5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### ✅ **Answer to Question 1:**
$$
\boxed{46.5 \text{ seconds}}
$$

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

### **Step 1: Distance for each person**
- First person goes from **1/F to 10/F** → 9 floors → $ 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{meters} $
- Second person goes from **1/F to 30/F** → 29 floors → $ 29 \times 5 = 145 \, \text{meters} $

### **Step 2: Time for the elevator to reach 10/F**
- Distance to 10/F: 45 meters
- Time to accelerate: 5 seconds (as before)
- Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
- Remaining distance: $ 45 - 12.5 = 32.5 \, \text{meters} $
- Time at max speed: $ \frac{32.5}{5} = 6.5 \, \text{seconds} $
- Time to decelerate: 5 seconds
- Total time to 10/F:
  $$
  5 + 6.5 + 5 = 16.5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 3: Time for the elevator to reach 30/F**
- Distance to 30/F: 145 meters
- Time to accelerate: 5 seconds
- Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
- Remaining distance: $ 145 - 12.5 = 132.5 \, \text{meters} $
- Time at max speed: $ \frac{132.5}{5} = 26.5 \, \text{seconds} $
- Time to decelerate: 5 seconds
- Total time to 30/F:
  $$
  5 + 26.5 + 5 = 36.5 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 4: Time for the elevator to stop at both floors**
- The elevator must stop at **10/F** and then go to **30/F**.
- So, the total time is the time to go from 1/F to 30/F, but with a stop at 10/F.

### **Step 5: Total time to go from 1/F to 30/F with a stop at 10/F**
- Time to go from 1/F to 10/F: 16.5 seconds
- Time to go from 10/F to 30/F: 36.5 seconds
- Total time:
  $$
  16.5 + 36.5 = 53 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### ✅ **Answer to Question 2:**
$$
\boxed{53 \text{ seconds}}
$$

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### **Step 1: Total distance to 40/F**
- Distance to 40/F: $ 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{meters} $

### **Step 2: Time to go from 1/F to 40/F (without stopping)**
- As calculated in Question 1: **46.5 seconds**

### **Step 3: If the lift must stop at another floor (say, floor X), what is the minimum time?**

- The lift must stop at **one floor** (say, floor X) between 1/F and 40/F.
- The lift will go from 1/F to X, then from X to 40/F.
- The **minimum time** occurs when the lift stops at the **floor that minimizes the total time**.

### **Step 4: Try stopping at floor X (say, floor 20)**
- Distance from 1/F to 20/F: $ 19 \times 5 = 95 \, \text{meters} $
- Distance from 20/F to 40/F: $ 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters} $

- Time to go from 1/F to 20/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 95 - 12.5 = 82.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{82.5}{5} = 16.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 20/F: $ 5 + 16.5 + 5 = 26.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Time to go from 20/F to 40/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 40/F: $ 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Total time with stop at 20/F:
  $$
  26.5 + 27.5 = 54 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 5: Try stopping at floor 10/F**
- Distance from 1/F to 10/F: 45 meters
- Distance from 10/F to 40/F: 145 meters

- Time to go from 1/F to 10/F: 16.5 seconds (from Question 2)
- Time to go from 10/F to 40/F: 36.5 seconds (from Question 2)
- Total time: $ 16.5 + 36.5 = 53 \, \text{seconds} $

### **Step 6: Try stopping at floor 15/F**
- Distance from 1/F to 15/F: $ 14 \times 5 = 70 \, \text{meters} $
- Distance from 15/F to 40/F: $ 25 \times 5 = 125 \, \text{meters} $

- Time to go from 1/F to 15/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 70 - 12.5 = 57.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{57.5}{5} = 11.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 15/F: $ 5 + 11.5 + 5 = 21.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Time to go from 15/F to 40/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 125 - 12.5 = 112.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{112.5}{5} = 22.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 40/F: $ 5 + 22.5 + 5 = 32.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Total time with stop at 15/F:
  $$
  21.5 + 32.5 = 54 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 7: Try stopping at floor 25/F**
- Distance from 1/F to 25/F: $ 24 \times 5 = 120 \, \text{meters} $
- Distance from 25/F to 40/F: $ 15 \times 5 = 75 \, \text{meters} $

- Time to go from 1/F to 25/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 120 - 12.5 = 107.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{107.5}{5} = 21.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 25/F: $ 5 + 21.5 + 5 = 31.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Time to go from 25/F to 40/F:
  - Accelerate: 5 seconds
  - Distance during acceleration: 12.5 meters
  - Remaining distance: $ 75 - 12.5 = 62.5 \, \text{meters} $
  - Time at max speed: $ \frac{62.5}{5} = 12.5 \, \text{seconds} $
  - Decelerate: 5 seconds
  - Total time to 40/F: $ 5 + 12.5 + 5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Total time with stop at 25/F:
  $$
  31.5 + 22.5 = 54 \, \text{seconds}
  $$

### **Step 8: Try stopping at floor 10/F (best so far)**
- Total time: **53 seconds**

### **Step 9: Try stopping at floor 15/F or 25/F**
- Total time: **54 seconds**

### **Step 10: Try stopping at floor 20/F**
- Total time: **54 seconds**

### **Conclusion:**
The **minimum time** occurs when the lift stops at **floor 10/F**, giving a total time of:
