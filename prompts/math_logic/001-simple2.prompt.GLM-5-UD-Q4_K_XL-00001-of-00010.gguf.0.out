Here are the answers to your questions with the provided steps.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**
The number 120 is a highly significant number in mathematics with several interesting properties:

*   **Factorial Number:** It is the factorial of 5 ($5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$). This makes it the smallest number with 16 divisors.
*   **Highly Composite Number:** It is a "highly composite number," meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).
*   **Sum of Twin Primes:** It is the sum of a pair of twin primes: $59 + 61 = 120$.
*   **Triangular Number:** It is the sum of the first eight triangular numbers ($1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 + 28 + 36 = 120$), making it a tetrahedral number.
*   **Practical Application:** In geometry, the internal angles of a regular hexagon are each 120 degrees.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Steps:**
1.  Identify the coefficients in the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
    *   $a = 1$
    *   $b = -7$
    *   $c = -18$
2.  We can solve this by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to $-18$ (the $c$ value) and add up to $-7$ (the $b$ value).
3.  List factors of $-18$:
    *   $1$ and $-18$ (Sum = $-17$)
    *   $-1$ and $18$ (Sum = $17$)
    *   $2$ and $-9$ (Sum = $-7$) $\leftarrow$ This is the correct pair.
4.  Rewrite the quadratic equation by splitting the middle term using the numbers found:
    $$x^2 + 2x - 9x - 18 = 0$$
5.  Factor by grouping:
    $$x(x + 2) - 9(x + 2) = 0$$
    $$(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$$
6.  Set each factor to zero to solve for $x$:
    $$x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$$
    $$x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$$

**Answer:**
The solutions are **$x = 9$** and **$x = -2$**.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Steps:**
1.  **Calculate the time for a one-way trip:**
    $$Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed}$$
    $$Time = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours}$$
    This is approximately $3.33$ hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes).

2.  **Calculate the time for a round trip:**
    A round trip consists of going there and coming back.
    $$Round\ Trip\ Time = 2 \times \left(\frac{10}{3} \text{ hours}\right) = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}$$
    This is approximately $6.67$ hours.

3.  **Determine the total time available:**
    A full day has $24$ hours.

4.  **Calculate the number of round trips:**
    $$Number\ of\ Trips = \frac{Total\ Time}{Time\ per\ Round\ Trip}$$
    $$Number\ of\ Trips = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}}$$
    $$Number\ of\ Trips = 24 \times \frac{3}{20}$$
    $$Number\ of\ Trips = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6$$

5.  **Interpret the result:**
    Since the train cannot make a partial trip (it must complete the full round trip to count), we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Answer:**
The train can make **3** complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
