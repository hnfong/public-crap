Got it, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I get each right, but if I'm unsure, I'll note that. 

Starting with Q1: 1+1=? That's basic addition, so 2. 

Q2: 6*7=? I remember 6*7 is 42, right? Yeah, 6*7=42.

Q3: 83*59. Let me calculate that. Maybe break it down: 83*(60-1)=83*60 - 83*1=4980 -83=4897. Let me check: 80*59=4720, 3*59=177, 4720+177=4897. Yep, that's right.

Q4: 349*683. Hmm, that's a bigger one. Let's do it step by step. 349*600=209400, 349*80=27920, 349*3=1047. Add them up: 209400 +27920=237320, then +1047=238367. Wait, let me verify with another method: 350*683=239050, minus 1*683=683, so 239050-683=238367. That seems right.

Q5: 6043*7489. Oh, that's a big multiplication. Maybe I should do this carefully. Let's break it down: 6043*(7000+400+80+9). 6043*7000=42,301,000; 6043*400=2,417,200; 6043*80=483,440; 6043*9=54,387. Now add them all: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200; +483,440=45,201,640; +54,387=45,256,027. Wait, is that correct? Let me check with approximate: 6000*7500=45,000,000, and the extra parts might add up to around 256k, so 45,256,027 seems plausible. I think that's right.

Q6: Solve 3x +7=22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x=15, then x=5. Simple algebra.

Q7: 25% of 80. 25% is 0.25, 0.25*80=20. Or 80/4=20, since 25% is a quarter. Correct.

Q8: Book costs $15. Gave two $20 bills, so that's $40, then additional $5, so total given is $45. So change is 45-15=30. Wait, the question says "she does not have exact change, so I give her an additional five dollar bill." So initial give was two $20s ($40), which is more than $15, but no exact change, so give another $5, making total $45. So change is 45-15=30. That makes sense.

Q9: Perimeter of square with side 5. Perimeter is 4*side, so 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine herself + two brothers + one sister = 4? Wait, wait: Katherine is a child, so her siblings are two brothers and one sister, so total children: 1 (Katherine) + 2 +1=4? Wait, is that right? The question says "how many children does her mother have" – assuming Katherine's parents are her mother and father, so yes, Katherine plus her siblings: 2 brothers, 1 sister, so 1+2+1=4. Unless there's a trick, but I think that's straightforward.

Q11: 3 +12 ÷4 -1. Order of operations: division first, so 12÷4=3, then 3+3=6, 6-1=5. So 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a party, 5 guests arrived. How many cake slices? Hmm, this is a bit tricky because usually, you might assume each person gets a slice, but the question doesn't say how many slices per person. Wait, maybe it's a trick question? Or maybe standard is 1 slice per person? But Tom is holding the party, so is Tom included? The question says "5 guests have arrived" – does that include Tom? Probably not, guests are others. But the question is "how many slices do they need?" "They" could be the guests, or everyone. But since it's not specified, maybe the answer is that we don't know? But maybe in common sense, each guest gets a slice, so 5? But maybe the question expects that, even though it's ambiguous. Wait, maybe it's a trick because you don't know if Tom is eating too, but the problem says "5 guests have arrived" – maybe the answer is 5? Or maybe it's impossible to tell. But maybe the intended answer is 5, assuming one slice per guest.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. 20% of 25 is 0.2*25=5, so sale price is 25-5=20.

Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes until 6:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours=180 minutes, but we need until 6:30, which is 15 minutes earlier, so 180-15=165 minutes. Let's check: 3:45 to 4:45=60, 4:45-5:45=60 (total 120), 5:45 to 6:30 is 45 minutes, so 120+45=165. Correct.

Q15: Taxi carries 4 passengers. 22 people. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, so you can't have half a taxi, so need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis carry 20, leaving 2, so need a 6th.

Q16: Triangle has two angles 31 and 62 degrees. Third angle is 180 - (31+62)=180-93=87 degrees. Sum of angles in triangle is 180, so that's right.

Now, checking if any are unsure. Q12 is a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify slices per person, but maybe the intended answer is 5 (one per guest). I think that's acceptable. The rest seem straightforward.</seed:think>Q1: 2
