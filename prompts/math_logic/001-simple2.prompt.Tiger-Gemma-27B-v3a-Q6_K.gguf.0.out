Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 holds significance in several areas, including mathematics, timekeeping, and geometry. Here's a breakdown of its properties:

*   **Factorial:** 120 is 5! (5 factorial), meaning 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Factorials are fundamental in combinatorics and probability.
*   **Divisibility:** 120 is highly divisible. Its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it useful in many calculations where you need to divide evenly.
*   **Angles in Geometry:** A regular pentagon has interior angles that sum to 540 degrees. Each angle in a regular pentagon is 108 degrees. 120 is related to the exterior angles of a regular hexagon (360/3 = 120).
*   **Time:** There are 120 minutes in 2 hours.
*   **Degrees in a Circle:** 120 degrees is one-third of a full circle (360 degrees).
*   **Least Common Multiple (LCM):** 120 is the LCM of many small numbers (1-10).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

Here's how to solve the quadratic equation:

1.  **Factoring:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. Those numbers are -9 and 2. So, we can factor the equation as:
    (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

2.  **Zero Product Property:** For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. Therefore:
    x - 9 = 0  or  x + 2 = 0

3.  **Solve for x:**
    x = 9  or  x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Here's how to solve this problem:

1.  **One-Way Trip Time:**
    Time = Distance / Speed
    Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

2.  **Round Trip Time:**
    A round trip is twice the one-way distance, so 400 km.
    Round Trip Time = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (approximately)

3.  **Hours in a Day:**
    A full day has 24 hours.

4.  **Number of Round Trips:**
    Number of Trips = Total Hours / Round Trip Time
    Number of Trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours/trip = 3.59 trips

Since the train can only complete whole round trips, it can make **3** round trips within a full day.
