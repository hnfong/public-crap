"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
 This statement is a simple mnemonic device to help you remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. While it's not always perfectly accurate, it can be a helpful shortcut in some cases.

The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
F = (C × 9/5) + 32

According to the mnemonic, "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" in the Fahrenheit scale. This means that if you have a temperature in Celsius that ends in 12 (like 12°C, 22°C, 32°C, etc.), the digits in the Fahrenheit equivalent will be the reverse of each other.

Let's look at some examples to understand this concept:

Example 1:
12°C = (12 × 9/5) + 32
12°C = 53.6°F

The digits in Fahrenheit (53.6) are reversed compared to the Celsius value (12).

Example 2:
22°C = (22 × 9/5) + 32
22°C = 71.6°F

Here, the Fahrenheit digits (71.6) are reversed compared to the Celsius value (22).

Example 3:
32°C = (32 × 9/5) + 32
32°C = 89.6°F

Again, the Fahrenheit digits (89.6) are reversed compared to the Celsius value (32).

Keep in mind that this mnemonic device doesn't work for all Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions, but it can help you remember some specific examples. For most conversions, it's better to use the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit formula (F = (C × 9/5) + 32) to get the most accurate results.
