Attempt: 8 * 3 - 4 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 24 - 4 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 = 29, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 = 29, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 - 4 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 - 4 = 26, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 - 4 * 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 - 4 = 26, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 - 4 * 1 + 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 - 4 + 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 - 4 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 - 4 + 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 * 1 - 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 - 4 * 1 + 1 * 1 - 3 = 24 + 4 - 1 + 3 - 4 + 1 - 3 = 24
