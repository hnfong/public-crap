Let's try to construct an expression using each of the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once to get 24.

Let me try some combinations:

First, let's see if we can use multiplication and addition/subtraction.

Try: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 * 1 = 7 (not 24)

Try: 8 * 3 = 24, but then we have 4 and 1 left unused.

But we must use all numbers.

Try: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 * 3 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21

Try: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Let's check if we used all numbers exactly once:
- 8
- 4
- 3
- 1

Yes, each is used once.

Now let's double check the calculation:
(8 + 4) = 12
(3 - 1) = 2
12 * 2 = 24

Perfect.

Now, let's write the attempt and double-check in the required format:

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. All numbers used exactly once.
```

So the answer is:

(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24 [end of text]
