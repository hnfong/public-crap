Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4887
Q4: 349*683=238167
Q5: 6043*7489=45155517
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 => 3x = 15 => x = 5
Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25*80 = 20
Q8: You gave the shopkeeper $30 (two $20 bills) and received $5 back, so the final change is $5.
Q9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter is 4*5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children (Katherine and her two brothers).
Q11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Each guest needs one slice of birthday cake, so they need 5 slices.
Q13: The sale price is 20% off of $25, so the discount is 0.20*25 = $5. The sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: There are 120 minutes from 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, so there are 120 - 60 = 60 minutes left.
Q15: There are 22 people and each taxi can carry 4 people, so they need 22/4 = 5.5 taxis. Since you can't have half a taxi, they need 6 taxis.
Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. The first two angles are 31 degrees and 62 degrees, so the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
