Let me go through each question one by one and provide the answers.

Q1: 1+1=?
This is a basic addition problem. 1+1 = 2.

Q2: 6*7=?
This is a basic multiplication problem. 6*7 = 42.

Q3: 83*59=?
Let me calculate this:
83 * 59 = 83 * (60 - 1) = 83*60 - 83*1 = 4980 - 83 = 4897

Q4: 349*683=?
This is a larger multiplication problem. Let me calculate:
349 * 683 = 238,367

Q5: 6043*7489=?
This is an even larger multiplication problem. Let me calculate:
6043 * 7489 = 45,261,007

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
3x + 7 = 22
3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
x = 15/3 = 5

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
I gave: 2 * $20 + $5 = $45
The book costs: $15
So the shopkeeper should give me: $45 - $15 = $30

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
Following order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
This question is ambiguous. It doesn't specify how many slices per person or if Tom is included in the count. If we assume each person gets one slice and Tom is not included in the 5 guests, then they would need 6 slices (5 guests + Tom). But if Tom is included in the 5 guests, then they would need 5 slices. Without more information, I'll assume the question means 5 guests plus Tom, so 6 slices.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
20% off of $25 = 0.20 * $25 = $5
Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
From 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM = 15 minutes
From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM = 2 hours = 120 minutes
From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM = 30 minutes
Total = 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
22 people ÷ 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis
Since we can't have half a taxi, we need to round up to 6 taxis.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So the third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.
