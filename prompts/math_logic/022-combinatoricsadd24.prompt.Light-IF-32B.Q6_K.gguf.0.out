Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to use the numbers **4, 3, 1, 8** exactly once each to create an expression that equals **24**. I'll try different combinations of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses) and check each attempt carefully.

---

### Attempt 1:  
**(8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16**  
Double checking: Uses all numbers? Yes. Result? 16. Not 24. Retrying.

---

### Attempt 2:  
**8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24**  
Double checking:  
- 8 * 3 = 24  
- 24 + 4 = 28  
- 28 - 1 = 27  
Result: 27. Not 24. Retrying.

---

### Attempt 3:  
**4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21**  
Double checking: Uses all numbers? Yes. Result? 21. Not 24. Retrying.

---

### Attempt 4:  
**8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28**  
Double checking: Uses all numbers? Yes. Result? 28. Not 24. Retrying.

---

### Attempt 5:  
**8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28** (Wait, same as Attempt 4. Try a new one.)

---

### Attempt 6:  
**(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24**  
Double checking:  
- 8 + 4 = 12  
- 3 - 1 = 2  
- 12 * 2 = 24  
Uses all numbers: 8, 4, 3, 1 → Yes!  
Result: 24. Perfect!

---

### Final Answer:  
**(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24**

Let's write all the attempts in the required format to show the process:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Uses all numbers: (8, 4, 3, 1). Success!
```

✅ Done! The expression **(8 + 4) * (3 - 1)** uses all the numbers **(4, 3, 1, 8)** exactly once and equals **24**. [end of text]
