Here are the step-by-step solutions to your math questions.

### **Preliminary Calculations: Distance and Motion Profile**

Before answering the specific questions, we must establish the distance and the motion profile of the elevator.

1.  **Total Distance Calculation:**
    *   Number of floors: 40
    *   Floors per story: 5 meters
    *   Distance from Ground (1/F) to Top (40/F):
        The elevator travels from floor 1 to floor 40. The number of intervals (stories) is $40 - 1 = 39$.
        $$ \text{Total Distance } (D_{total}) = 39 \text{ stories} \times 5 \text{ m/story} = 195 \text{ meters} $$

2.  **Motion Profile Analysis:**
    *   Acceleration ($a$) = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$
    *   Deceleration ($d$) = $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (magnitude)
    *   Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$) = $5 \, \text{m/s}$

    Let's calculate the time and distance required to reach maximum speed:
    *   Time to reach $v_{max}$ ($t_{acc}$):
        $$ v = a \times t \Rightarrow 5 = 1 \times t_{acc} \Rightarrow t_{acc} = 5 \, \text{s} $$
    *   Distance covered during acceleration ($d_{acc}$):
        $$ d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \Rightarrow d_{acc} = 0.5 \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} $$

    Since the deceleration is the same magnitude, the time and distance to stop from $v_{max}$ are also $5 \, \text{s}$ and $12.5 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Total distance for acceleration + deceleration phases:
        $$ d_{acc+dec} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $$

    **Comparison with Total Distance:**
    Since the total distance ($195 \, \text{m}$) is greater than the distance required to accelerate and decelerate ($25 \, \text{m}$), the elevator **will reach its maximum speed** and travel at a constant speed for a period of time.

    *   Distance at constant speed ($d_{const}$):
        $$ d_{const} = D_{total} - d_{acc+dec} = 195 - 25 = 170 \, \text{m} $$
    *   Time at constant speed ($t_{const}$):
        $$ t_{const} = \frac{d_{const}}{v_{max}} = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{s} $$

    *   **Total Time Formula for a single trip:**
        $$ t_{total} = t_{acc} + t_{const} + t_{dec} = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{s} $$

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

**Step 1: Determine the distance.**
As calculated above, the distance from 1/F to 40/F is 39 stories.
$$ D = 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{m} $$

**Step 2: Determine the motion phases.**
*   **Acceleration phase:** $0 \to 5 \, \text{m/s}$ at $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
    *   Time: $5 \, \text{s}$
    *   Distance: $12.5 \, \text{m}$
*   **Deceleration phase:** $5 \, \text{m/s} \to 0$ at $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
    *   Time: $5 \, \text{s}$
    *   Distance: $12.5 \, \text{m}$
*   **Constant speed phase:**
    *   Remaining distance: $195 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 170 \, \text{m}$
    *   Time: $170 / 5 = 34 \, \text{s}$

**Step 3: Sum the times.**
$$ t = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{s} $$

**Answer 1:** It takes **44 seconds**.

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

*Note: The question asks "How long does it take?" usually implying the time until the lift completes the journey for the last passenger (30/F), or the time until the lift returns to the ground? Given the context of "getting to the top" in Q1, this usually implies the time until the lift reaches the destination of the last passenger (30/F) and stops.*

**Step 1: Determine the distance to the last stop (30/F).**
*   Floors traveled: $30 - 1 = 29$ stories.
*   Distance ($D_{30}$):
    $$ D_{30} = 29 \times 5 = 145 \, \text{m} $$

**Step 2: Check if the elevator reaches max speed.**
*   Distance required to accelerate and decelerate: $25 \, \text{m}$ (calculated in preliminary steps).
*   Since $145 > 25$, the elevator reaches max speed.

**Step 3: Calculate time for the trip to 30/F.**
*   **Acceleration:** $5 \, \text{s}$ (covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$)
*   **Deceleration:** $5 \, \text{s}$ (covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$)
*   **Constant Speed Distance:**
    $$ 145 - 25 = 120 \, \text{m} $$
*   **Constant Speed Time:**
    $$ 120 / 5 = 24 \, \text{s} $$
*   **Total Time:**
    $$ 5 + 24 + 5 = 34 \, \text{s} $$

*Note on the first passenger:* The elevator stops at 10/F.
*   Distance to 10/F: $9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{m}$.
*   Time to 10/F:
    *   Acc: $5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$)
    *   Const: $(45 - 25) / 5 = 4 \, \text{s}$
    *   Dec: $5 \, \text{s}$
    *   Total to 10/F: $14 \, \text{s}$.
*   The elevator stops at 10/F (let's assume a standard door open/close time, but since no door time is given, we assume instantaneous stops or that the question asks for travel time only).
*   Then it travels from 10/F to 30/F.
    *   Distance: $20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Since $100 > 25$, it accelerates, cruises, and decelerates again.
    *   Time for this leg: $5 + (100-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s}$.
*   Total time = Time(1/F to 10/F) + Time(10/F to 30/F) = $14 + 25 = 39 \, \text{s}$.

**Wait, let's re-evaluate the "Stop" logic.**
If the elevator stops at 10/F, it must decelerate to 0, wait (door open), and accelerate again.
1.  **Leg 1 (1/F to 10/F):**
    *   Distance: $45 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Profile: Acc ($12.5 \, \text{m}$), Const ($20 \, \text{m}$), Dec ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
    *   Time: $5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \, \text{s}$.
    *   *Stop at 10/F.* (Assuming 0s for door time as none is provided, or the question implies pure travel time).
2.  **Leg 2 (10/F to 30/F):**
    *   Distance: $100 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Profile: Acc ($12.5 \, \text{m}$), Const ($75 \, \text{m}$), Dec ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
    *   Time: $5 + (75/5) + 5 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s}$.

**Total Time:** $14 + 25 = 39 \, \text{s}$.

*Alternative Interpretation:* If the question implies the elevator doesn't stop at 10/F (e.g., the first person just gets off without the lift stopping, which is physically impossible for a lift), the time would be the same as reaching 30/F directly ($34 \, \text{s}$). However, standard physics problems involving lifts imply a stop.
Let's assume the standard case: **Stop at 10/F, then go to 30/F.**

**Answer 2:** It takes **39 seconds** (assuming instantaneous door operation). If door operation time is required, it would be $39 + 2 \times (\text{door time})$. Without door time specified, 39s is the travel time.

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

**Analysis:**
*   **Goal:** Reach 40/F.
*   **Constraint:** Must stop at exactly one intermediate floor ($F_{stop}$) where $1 < F_{stop} < 40$.
*   **Objective:** Minimize the total time.
*   **Logic:** To minimize time, we want to minimize the number of acceleration/deceleration cycles.
    *   Direct trip (1/F to 40/F): 1 Acc, 1 Const, 1 Dec.
    *   Trip with stop (1/F to $F_{stop}$ to 40/F):
        *   Leg 1: Acc, Const (maybe), Dec.
        *   Leg 2: Acc, Const (maybe), Dec.
    *   Every stop adds a full acceleration and deceleration cycle.
    *   To minimize time, we should choose a stop location that minimizes the "wasted" distance in the constant speed phase or minimizes the number of stops. Since we *must* stop once, we have to accept the penalty of two acceleration/deceleration cycles.
    *   However, the question asks for the **minimum time**. Does the location of the stop matter?
        *   If we stop very close to the start (e.g., 2/F), we accelerate, decelerate, then accelerate again for a long distance.
        *   If we stop very close to the end (e.g., 39/F), we travel long, decelerate, then accelerate, then decelerate.
        *   If we stop in the middle, we split the constant speed distance.
    *   **Crucial Physics Insight:** The time taken to accelerate and decelerate is fixed ($5s + 5s = 10s$ per stop). The distance covered during these phases is fixed ($12.5m + 12.5m = 25m$ per stop).
    *   Total Distance = $195 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Total Distance covered by Acc/Dec phases = $2 \times 25 = 50 \, \text{m}$ (since we stop once, we do Acc/Dec twice).
    *   Remaining distance for constant speed = $195 - 50 = 145 \, \text{m}$.
    *   Time at constant speed = $145 / 5 = 29 \, \text{s}$.
    *   Total Time = (Acc/Dec time) + (Const time) = $(5+5) + (5+5) + 29 = 10 + 10 + 29 = 49 \, \text{s}$.

    **Does the floor location matter?**
    Let's test two scenarios:
    *   **Scenario A: Stop at 2/F.**
        *   Leg 1 (1 to 2): $5 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Acc: $12.5 \, \text{m}$ needed to reach max speed. We only have $5 \, \text{m}$.
            *   We cannot reach max speed. We accelerate for distance $d$, then immediately decelerate.
            *   $d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = a t^2$.
            *   $5 = 1 \times t^2 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \, \text{s}$.
            *   Time for Leg 1 = $2 \times 2.236 = 4.47 \, \text{s}$.
        *   Leg 2 (2 to 40): $190 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Acc: $5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
            *   Dec: $5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
            *   Const: $(190 - 25) / 5 = 33 \, \text{s}$.
            *   Time Leg 2 = $5 + 33 + 5 = 43 \, \text{s}$.
        *   Total = $4.47 + 43 = 47.47 \, \text{s}$.

    *   **Scenario B: Stop at 39/F.**
        *   Leg 1 (1 to 39): $38 \times 5 = 190 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Acc: $5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
            *   Dec: $5 \, \text{s}$ ($12.5 \, \text{m}$).
            *   Const: $(190 - 25) / 5 = 33 \, \text{s}$.
            *   Time Leg 1 = $43 \, \text{s}$.
        *   Leg 2 (39 to 40): $5 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Same as Scenario A Leg 1: $4.47 \, \text{s}$.
        *   Total = $47.47 \, \text{s}$.

    *   **Scenario C: Stop at a floor where we can reach max speed in both legs.**
        *   We need distance $\ge 25 \, \text{m}$ for each leg to reach max speed.
        *   $25 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{stories}$.
        *   So if we stop at floor $X$ such that distance from 1 to $X \ge 25$ and distance from $X$ to 40 $\ge 25$.
        *   $X-1 \ge 5 \Rightarrow X \ge 6$.
        *   $40-X \ge 5 \Rightarrow X \le 35$.
        *   If we stop at floor 10 (40m) or floor 20 (95m), both legs are long enough to reach max speed.
        *   In this case, the calculation is:
            *   Leg 1: Acc (5s) + Const + Dec (5s).
            *   Leg 2: Acc (5s) + Const + Dec (5s).
            *   Total Acc/Dec time = $20 \, \text{s}$.
            *   Total Distance = $195 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Distance used for Acc/Dec = $2 \times 25 = 50 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Distance for Const = $145 \, \text{m}$.
            *   Time for Const = $29 \, \text{s}$.
            *   Total Time = $20 + 29 = 49 \, \text{s}$.

    **Comparison:**
    *   Scenario A/B (Stop very close): **47.47 s**.
    *   Scenario C (Stop far enough): **49 s**.

    **Why is stopping close faster?**
    Because if the distance is short (less than 25m), the elevator never reaches the maximum speed of 5 m/s. It accelerates and decelerates immediately. The average speed in a short trip (accelerate then decelerate) is lower than the max speed, but the *time penalty* of stopping is the issue.
    Wait, let's re-calculate the "Short Trip" time carefully.
    Distance $d = 5 \, \text{m}$.
    $d = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} a t_2^2$. Since $a$ is same, $t_1 = t_2 = t$.
    $5 = a t^2 \Rightarrow 5 = 1 \cdot t^2 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$.
    Total time = $2t = 4.472 \, \text{s}$.
    Average speed = $5 / 4.472 \approx 1.11 \, \text{m/s}$.

    If we didn't stop, and just went 5m:
    $5 = 1 \cdot t^2 \Rightarrow t = 2.
