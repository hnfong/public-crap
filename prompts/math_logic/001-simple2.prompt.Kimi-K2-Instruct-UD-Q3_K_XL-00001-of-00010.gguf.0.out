Q1: Significance and interesting properties of 120  

1. Factorial  
   120 = 5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5.  
   It is the smallest number that is the factorial of an integer greater than 4.

2. Highly composite  
   120 has more divisors (16 of them) than any smaller positive integer, so it is the 3rd highly composite number (after 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120).

3. Perfectly divisible by the first five positive integers  
   120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

4. Triangular, hexagonal, and tetrahedral  
   - Triangular: T₁₅ = 15·16/2 = 120.  
   - Hexagonal: H₈ = 8(2·8 – 1) = 120.  
   - Tetrahedral: Te₈ = 8·9·10/6 = 120.

5. Sum of the first eight odd primes  
   3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 37 = 120 (one of several such sums).

6. Euler’s totient  
   φ(120) = 32, the count of integers ≤ 120 that are coprime to 120.

7. Internal angles of a regular hexagon  
   Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°.

8. Archimedean solids  
   There are exactly 120 vertices in the truncated icosahedron (soccer-ball shape).

9. Chemistry  
   The temporary IUPAC systematic placeholder name for element 120 is “Unbinilium” (symbol Ubn).

10. Time  
    Two hours = 120 minutes.

Q2: Solve x² – 7x – 18 = 0  

Step 1: Factor the quadratic.  
We need two numbers whose product is –18 and whose sum is –7.  
Those numbers are –9 and +2.  
x² – 7x – 18 = (x – 9)(x + 2) = 0.

Step 2: Set each factor to zero.  
x – 9 = 0  ⇒  x = 9  
x + 2 = 0  ⇒  x = –2

Answer: x = 9 or x = –2.

Q3: Round trips in a day  

Step 1: Distance for one round trip  
200 km out + 200 km back = 400 km.

Step 2: Time for one round trip  
Time = distance / speed = 400 km / 60 km h⁻¹ = 20/3 h ≈ 6 h 40 min.

Step 3: Number of round trips in 24 h  
24 h ÷ (20/3 h per trip) = 24 × 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Since only whole trips count, the train can complete 3 full round trips within 24 hours. [end of text]
