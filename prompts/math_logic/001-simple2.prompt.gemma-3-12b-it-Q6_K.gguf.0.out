Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 holds significance in various fields, including mathematics, timekeeping, and even some cultural contexts. Here's a breakdown of its significance and properties:

*   **Factorial:** 120 is 5! (5 factorial), meaning 120 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.  This is a fundamental concept in combinatorics (counting).
*   **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number. This means it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Let's list its divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.  That's 16 divisors!
*   **Triangular Number:** 120 is not a triangular number. Triangular numbers are numbers that can be represented as an equilateral triangle of dots.
*   **Sum of Consecutive Integers:** 120 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers. For example, 120 = 7 + 8 + 9 + ... + 15.
*   **Timekeeping:**  There are 120 minutes in two hours.  Historically, some timekeeping systems used 120 as a base.
*   **Geometry:**  The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 120 * 180 = 540 degrees.
*   **Combinatorics:**  The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects in a row is 5! = 120.

**In summary, 120 is a special number due to its factorial nature, its abundance of divisors, and its connections to various mathematical and practical applications.**

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Factoring is often the easiest if it's possible.

*   **Factoring:**
    *   We need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7.
    *   Those numbers are -9 and 2.
    *   So, we can rewrite the equation as: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
    *   For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.
    *   Therefore, x - 9 = 0  or  x + 2 = 0
    *   Solving for x:  x = 9  or  x = -2

*   **Quadratic Formula:**
    *   The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
    *   In our equation, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.
    *   Plugging in the values: x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * -18)) / (2 * 1)
    *   x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
    *   x = (7 ± √121) / 2
    *   x = (7 ± 11) / 2
    *   x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
    *   x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

**Answer:** The solutions to the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Here's how to solve this problem:

1.  **Calculate the time for one trip:**
    *   Time = Distance / Speed
    *   Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours (approximately 3.33 hours)

2.  **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
    *   Round trip distance = 200 km * 2 = 400 km
    *   Time for one round trip = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours (approximately 6.67 hours)

3.  **Calculate the number of round trips in a day:**
    *   A full day has 24 hours.
    *   Number of round trips = 24 hours / (20/3 hours/round trip) = 24 * (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

4.  **Since the train can only make whole round trips, we round down.**

**Answer:** The train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
