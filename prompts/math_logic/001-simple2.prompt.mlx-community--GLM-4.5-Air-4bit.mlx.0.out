### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is significant in various mathematical, historical, and cultural contexts. Here are some of its interesting properties:

1. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120 (total of 16 divisors).

2. **Factorial**: 120 is equal to 5! (5 factorial), which is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. This makes it a factorial number.

3. **Sum of First n Integers**: 120 is the sum of the first 15 positive integers (1 + 2 + ... + 15 = 120).

4. **Triangular Number**: It is the 15th triangular number, which can be represented as a triangle with 15 dots on each side.

5. **Pronic Number**: 120 is a pronic number (or rectangular number), meaning it is the product of two consecutive integers: 10 × 12 = 120.

6. **Harmonic Divisor Number**: 120 is a harmonic divisor number, meaning the harmonic mean of its divisors is an integer.

7. **Cultural and Historical Significance**:
   - In the Bible, the lifespan of Moses is traditionally given as 120 years (Deuteronomy 34:7).
   - In some cultures, 120 is considered a significant age for humans, symbolizing a long and complete life.
   - In the Hebrew calendar, the number 120 is associated with wisdom and the age at which one is considered to have reached full maturity.

8. **Mathematical Properties**:
   - It is a practical number, meaning all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of 120.
   - It is a semiperfect number, meaning it is equal to the sum of some of its proper divisors (e.g., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 = 120).

9. **Geometry**: In a regular pentagon, the ratio of the diagonal to the side is the golden ratio, and 120 appears in the context of pentagonal numbers and related geometric properties.

10. **Physics and Chemistry**: In the context of atomic physics, 120 is the atomic number of the yet-to-be-synthesized element unbinilium (Ubn), which would be the next element after oganesson (element 118).

These are just a few of the many interesting properties and significances of the number 120.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**
To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant (\( D \)):
   \[ D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
   \[ \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Plug the values into the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):
   - First solution:
     \[ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   - Second solution:
     \[ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours), let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance for one round trip**:
   - One way: 200 km
   - Round trip: 200 km × 2 = 400 km

2. **Calculate the time taken for one round trip**:
   - Speed = 60 km/h
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = \( \frac{400}{60} \) hours = \( \frac{20}{3} \) hours ≈ 6.666... hours

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours**:
   - Number of trips = Total time / Time per trip = 24 hours / \( \frac{20}{3} \) hours = 24 × \( \frac{3}{20} \) = \( \frac{72}{20} \) = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can complete 3 full round trips in 24 hours. The remaining time is not enough for another full round trip.

**Final Answer:**
The train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day.</think>### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)  
**Answer:**  
Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -18\):  
1. **Discriminant**: \(D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121\).  
2. **Square root of D**: \(\sqrt{121} = 11\).  
3. **Solutions**:  
   - \(x = \frac{-(-7) + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\),  
   - \(x = \frac{-(-7) - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\).  
**Final Answer**: \(x = 9\) or \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips can it make in a full day (24 hours)?  
**Answer:**  
1. **Round trip distance**: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\).  
2. **Time per round trip**: \(\frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}\).  
3. **Trips in 24 hours**: \(\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = 3.6\).
