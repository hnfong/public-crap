**x = 5** (3x = 15, therefore x = 5)

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
**20** (25% is the same as 1/4, and 80/4 = 20)

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
**$20** (You gave 2 * $20 + $5 = $45. The book costs $15, so the change is $45 - $15 = $30. However, the shopkeeper didn't have exact change, so you gave an additional $5. Therefore, the final change is $30 - $5 = $25. But the question asks for the final change the shopkeeper should give you, so it should be $25.)

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
**20 units** (Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length, so 4 * 5 = 20)

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
**4 children** (Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4)

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
**6** (Following order of operations: 12 รท 4 = 3, then 3 + 3 - 1 = 5)

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
**I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5.** (This is a bit of a trick question. It depends on how many slices per person, but a reasonable assumption is at least one slice per guest.)

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
**$20** (20% of $25 is $5, so the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20)

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
**165 minutes** (From 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM is 15 minutes. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours (120 minutes). From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is 30 minutes. Total: 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes)

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
**6 taxis** (22 / 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up to 6)

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
**87 degrees** (The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 180 - 31 - 62 = 87)
