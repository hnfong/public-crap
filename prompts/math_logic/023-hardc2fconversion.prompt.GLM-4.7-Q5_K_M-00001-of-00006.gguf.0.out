This phrase is a **mnemonic** (a memory aid) used to approximate the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It relies on a mathematical coincidence where specific numbers look like "flipped" or "inverted" versions of each other.

Here is the breakdown of what it means, the math behind it, and examples of how to use it.

### The Core Concept
The rule states that for every increase of **12°C**, the Fahrenheit temperature increases by approximately **21.6°F**.

Because of this specific ratio, the digits in the temperature often swap places or "invert" as you move up the scale.

### The "Magic" Numbers
The rule works best around the temperatures **26°C** and **37°C**.

1.  **26°C is roughly 80°F.**
    *   Notice the digits: **2** and **6** become **8** and **0**.
    *   If you write "26" and flip it upside down (like on a calculator), it looks like "92". That isn't 80. However, if you look at the *values*, the digits have essentially swapped magnitude: the small number (2) became the tens digit in Fahrenheit (8), and the large number (6) became the ones digit (0).
2.  **37°C is roughly 99°F.**
    *   Notice the digits: **3** and **7** become **9** and **9**.
    *   This is a perfect "inversion" in terms of symmetry. 3 and 7 are equidistant from 5 (the middle number). When you average them ($3+7=10$, $10/2=5$), you get 5. If you "invert" them around the center, you land on 9 and 9.

### Examples of the Rule in Action

Here is how the "every 12°C" pattern creates these inverted digits:

**Example 1: The 26°C Anchor**
*   **Temperature:** 26°C
*   **Actual Fahrenheit:** 78.8°F (Rounds to **80°F**)
*   **The Inversion:** The digits **2** and **6** transform into **8** and **0**.

**Example 2: The 37°C Anchor**
*   **Temperature:** 37°C (Human body temperature)
*   **Actual Fahrenheit:** 98.6°F (Rounds to **99°F**)
*   **The Inversion:** The digits **3** and **7** transform into **9** and **9**.

**Example 3: Going Down by 12°C**
If you subtract 12 from the anchors above, the pattern holds (roughly):
*   **Start:** 26°C (80°F)
*   **Minus 12°C:** 14°C
*   **Actual Fahrenheit:** 57.2°F (Rounds to **57°F**)
*   **The Inversion:** The digits **1** and **4** have transformed into **5** and **7**. (1+4=5, which is the first digit of the result).

### Summary
The phrase is a handy way to remember two common temperature benchmarks without doing complex math:

*   **26°C $\approx$ 80°F** (Digits 2, 6 $\rightarrow$ 8, 0)
*   **37°C $\approx$ 99°F** (Digits 3, 7 $\rightarrow$ 9, 9)

It is not a perfect scientific formula, but a useful trick for estimating weather temperatures. [end of text]
