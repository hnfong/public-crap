Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4917
Q4: 349*683=239787
Q5: 6043*7489=452994117
Q6: To solve the equation, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7, which gives 3x = 15. Divide both sides by 3 to isolate x: x = 15 / 3, so x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20 (25/100 * 80 = 20).
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you $20 (since the total spent is $15 and you gave two $20 bills, she's supposed to return $20 - $15 = $5).
Q9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so 4*5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 1 (Katherine) + 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) = 4 children.
Q11: 3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: There are 5 guests, and typically a birthday cake is cut into 8 slices, so they would need 5*8 = 40 slices. However, if they only need enough for each guest to have one slice, they would need 5 slices.
Q13: The sale price is $25 - ($25 * 20/100) = $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 2*60 + 45 = 165 minutes.
Q15: To transport 22 people, 22 รท 4 = 5.5, which means you'd need 6 taxis (since you can't have half a taxi).
Q16: The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the third angle is 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.<|end|>
