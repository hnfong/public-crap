Let's solve each question step by step.

Given:
- Number of floors: 40
- Height per floor: 5 m
- Total height from ground to top: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) m
- Acceleration/deceleration: \( a = 1 \) m/sÂ²
- Maximum speed: \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \) m/s

The lift motion consists of three phases: acceleration, constant speed (if reached), and deceleration.

Time to accelerate to maximum speed:
Time to reach \( v_{\text{max}} \): \( t_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \) s
Distance during acceleration: \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 25 = 12.5 \) m
Similarly, deceleration takes same time and distance.

So, for a long journey, the lift accelerates for 12.5 m, travels at constant speed for some distance, and decelerates for 12.5 m.

### Question 1: From ground (1/F) to top (40/F), total height 200 m.

Total distance: 200 m

Distance needed to accelerate and decelerate: \( 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \) m
So, constant speed distance: \( 200 - 25 = 175 \) m
Time at constant speed: \( t_2 = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \) s

Total time: acceleration time + constant time + deceleration time = \( 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \) s

**Answer 1: 45 seconds**

### Question 2: Two people: one to 10/F, one to 30/F.

We need to compute the time for the lift to deliver both. The lift will stop at 10/F and then at 30/F.

First, from ground to 10/F:
Height to 10/F: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) m (since ground is 1/F, so 10 floors above means 9 intervals? Wait careful: Floors are numbered 1 to 40. Ground is 1/F. So going from 1/F to 10/F: actually 9 floors up? But each floor is 5m tall, so the height from ground to floor n is \( (n-1) \times 5 \) m? Actually, if ground floor is at height 0, then floor 1 is at 0m? But typically, the ground floor is at height 0, and the first floor above is at 5m? But the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall", and "ground floor (1/F)". So it seems they are considering the ground floor as the first floor, so floor n is at height \( (n-1) \times 5 \) m? But wait: if there are 40 stories, and each story is 5m tall, the building height is 40*5=200m. So top floor (40/F) is at 200m? But ground is at 0m. So floor k is at height \( (k-1) \times 5 \) m.

So:
- Ground floor (1/F): height 0 m
- Floor 10: height \( (10-1) \times 5 = 45 \) m
- Floor 30: height \( (30-1) \times 5 = 145 \) m
- Top floor (40): height \( (40-1) \times 5 = 195 \) m? But wait, that would be 39*5=195m, but we said total height 200m. Inconsistency.

Clarify: The building has 40 stories. Each floor is 5m tall. So the height from ground to roof of top floor is 40*5=200m. But the floors are at levels: floor 1 at 0m (ground), floor 2 at 5m, ..., floor 40 at 195m? But then the top of floor 40 is at 200m. However, the lift stops at the floor level, so for floor n, the stopping height is \( (n-1) \times 5 \) m.

But in the first question, from ground to top floor: we computed 200m total? Actually, if top floor is at 195m (since floor 40 is at 195m), then distance is 195m. But we computed 200m earlier. So there is confusion.

Let me read the problem: "Each floor is 5 meters tall." And "from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)". The ground floor is the first floor. So the height of the building from ground to the top of the top floor is 40 * 5 = 200m. But the lift stops at the floor level. So for floor n, the height is the height of the floor above ground. Typically, the ground floor is at 0m, and the first floor above is at 5m. So floor 1 (ground) is at 0m, floor 2 at 5m, ..., floor 40 at 195m. But the top of the building is at 200m. However, the lift goes to the floor, so for floor 40, it stops at 195m.

But in question 1, we computed for 200m? That was mistake.

Correct: The distance from ground to top floor (40/F) is actually the height of floor 40 above ground, which is \( (40-1) \times 5 = 195 \) m.

So for question 1: total distance = 195 m.

Then:
Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
So constant speed distance: 195 - 25 = 170 m
Time constant: 170 / 5 = 34 s
Total time: 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 s.

But earlier I computed 45s for 200m. So for 195m, it should be 44s.

Now for question 2: stops at 10/F and 30/F.

Heights:
- To 10/F: \( (10-1)*5 = 45 \) m
- To 30/F: \( (30-1)*5 = 145 \) m

Now, the lift goes from ground (0m) to 45m, then to 145m.

We need to compute the time for the entire trip until the second person gets off.

First segment: from 0 to 45m.

Check if it reaches max speed.
Distance to accelerate to max: 12.5m, and to decelerate: 12.5m, total 25m. Since 45 > 25, it will reach max speed.

So for 45m:
Acceleration phase: 12.5m in 5s.
Deceleration phase: 12.5m in 5s.
Constant distance: 45 - 25 = 20m at 5m/s, time = 4s.
So time to go from 0 to 45m: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14s.

But wait, the lift must stop at 45m, so it decelerates to stop.

Now, from 45m to 145m: distance = 100m.

Again, it will accelerate from rest at 45m to max speed, then decelerate to stop at 145m.

Acceleration: from 45m, it accelerates for 12.5m to reach max speed? But careful: when it leaves 45m, it starts from speed 0, accelerates for 5s to reach 5m/s, covering 12.5m. Then it decelerates similarly.

So for 100m journey:
Acceleration distance: 12.5m
Deceleration distance: 12.5m
Constant distance: 100 - 25 = 75m at 5m/s, time = 15s.
So time for this segment: acceleration time (5s) + constant time (15s) + deceleration time (5s) = 25s.

But note: when the lift arrives at 45m, it comes to stop (to let person off). Then it starts again from rest to go to 145m.

So total time from ground to
