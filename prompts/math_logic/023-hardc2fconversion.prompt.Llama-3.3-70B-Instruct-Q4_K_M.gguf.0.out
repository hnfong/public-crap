"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

Let me break it down.

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device to help convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It means that when you add 12°C to a temperature, the digits of the resulting Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the original Celsius temperature.

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

* 0°C = 32°F (no inversion, just a base case)
* 12°C = 53.6°F (not exactly an inversion, but let's move on to more examples)
* 24°C = 75.2°F (not an exact inversion either)
* But wait, let's try some specific cases:
	+ 12°C = 53.6°F, and if we invert the digits, we get 35, which is close to the actual Fahrenheit value.
	+ 24°C = 75.2°F, and if we invert the digits, we get 57, which is not exactly correct.

I think I see where the issue is. The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not entirely accurate. It's not a hard and fast rule that works for all temperatures.

A better approach to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to use the actual formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.

If you'd like, I can provide more examples using this formula. [end of text]
