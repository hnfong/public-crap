Let me break it down.

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device to help convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It means that for every 12-degree increment in Celsius, the digits of the temperature in Fahrenheit are reversed.

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

* 0°C = 32°F (no inversion, just a base case)
* 12°C = 54°F ( digits are inverted: 12 becomes 21, and then 54)
* 24°C = 75°F ( digits are inverted: 24 becomes 42, and then 75, but note that this is not a direct inversion, the rule is not exact)
* 36°C = 97°F ( digits are inverted: 36 becomes 63, and then 97, but again, not a direct inversion)

Wait, it seems I made a mistake. The rule "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not accurate. It's not a reliable way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

A more accurate way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to use the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.

Let me start over and provide a correct explanation.

The original statement is incorrect, and I couldn't find a simple inversion rule that works for all Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions. If you need to convert temperatures, it's best to use the formula or a reliable conversion tool. [end of text]
