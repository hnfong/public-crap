I'll do my best to answer each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in various fields. Here are a few:

1. **Degrees in a triangle**: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees, and 120 degrees is a significant angle in many geometric shapes, such as equilateral triangles and hexagons.
2. **Minutes and seconds**: There are 120 minutes in 2 hours, and 120 seconds in 2 minutes. This is because there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.
3. **Electrical engineering**: 120 volts is a common voltage for household electrical systems in some countries, particularly in North America.
4. **Mathematics**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has many factors, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

These are just a few examples of the significance and interesting properties of the number 120.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:

1. Factor the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - ?)(x - ?) = 0
2. Find two numbers whose product is -18 and whose sum is -7. These numbers are -9 and 2, since (-9) × (2) = -18 and (-9) + (2) = -7.
3. Write the factored form: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
4. Solve for x: x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
5. Solve for x: x = 9 or x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the train to make one round trip and then divide the total number of hours in a day by that time.

1. Calculate the time for one round trip:
	* Distance between cities = 200 km
	* Speed = 60 km/h
	* Time for one way = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours
	* Time for round trip = 2 × Time for one way = 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours
2. Calculate the number of round trips in a day:
	* Total hours in a day = 24 hours
	* Number of round trips = Total hours in a day / Time for round trip = 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.6
3. Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 3 round trips

Therefore, the train can make approximately 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
