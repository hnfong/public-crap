The statement is suggesting a quick way to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures by observing the pattern in the numbering of degrees. Here's an explanation with examples:

1. First, let's understand the conversion formula for Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

2. To remember the pattern, we can use the rule: every 12°C, the digits are inverted.

3. Let's break down the rule using an example:

   - At 0°C, the digits are 0.
   - At 12°C, the digits are 12.
   - At 24°C, the digits are 24.
   - At 36°C, the digits are 36.

4. Now, let's convert these temperatures to Fahrenheit:

   - 0°C is 32°F.
   - 12°C is 53.6°F.
   - 24°C is 75.2°F.
   - 36°C is 96.8°F.

5. Observe the pattern: the Fahrenheit values end with a 2 (e.g., 32, 53.6, 75.2, 96.8).

6. Now, we can use this pattern to convert any Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit. For example:

   - To convert 17°C to Fahrenheit, we notice that 17 is halfway between 12°C and 24°C (17 - 12 = 5, 24 - 17 = 7).
   - Thus, we know that 17°C is halfway between 53.6°F and 75.2°F.
   - To find the midpoint, we add the two temperatures and divide by 2: (53.6 + 75.2) / 2 = 64.4°F.

By following this pattern, we can easily convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.<|im_end|>
