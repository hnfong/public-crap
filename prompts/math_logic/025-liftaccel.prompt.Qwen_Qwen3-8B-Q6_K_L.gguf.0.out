Let's solve each question step by step.

### **Given:**
- Building has **40 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters** tall.
- Lift **acceleration/deceleration** is **1 m/s²**.
- Lift **maximum speed** is **5 m/s**.

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

### **Step 1: Calculate total distance**
- From 1/F to 40/F = 39 floors.
- Each floor = 5 meters.
- Total distance = $ 39 \times 5 = 195 $ meters.

### **Step 2: Determine time to accelerate to max speed**
- Acceleration = 1 m/s².
- Time to reach max speed = $ t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 $ seconds.
- Distance covered during acceleration = $ \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 $ meters.

### **Step 3: Determine time to decelerate to stop**
- Deceleration = 1 m/s².
- Time to decelerate = same as acceleration = 5 seconds.
- Distance covered during deceleration = same as acceleration = 12.5 meters.

### **Step 4: Determine time at constant speed**
- Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration = $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 $ meters.
- Remaining distance = $ 195 - 25 = 170 $ meters.
- Time at constant speed = $ \frac{170}{5} = 34 $ seconds.

### **Step 5: Total time**
- Total time = time to accelerate + time at constant speed + time to decelerate
- Total time = $ 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 $ seconds.

### ✅ **Answer to Question 1: 44 seconds**

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

### **Step 1: Determine the distance to 10/F**
- From 1/F to 10/F = 9 floors.
- Distance = $ 9 \times 5 = 45 $ meters.

### **Step 2: Determine the distance to 30/F**
- From 1/F to 30/F = 29 floors.
- Distance = $ 29 \times 5 = 145 $ meters.

### **Step 3: Determine the time to reach 10/F**
- Time to accelerate to max speed = 5 seconds.
- Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.
- Remaining distance = $ 45 - 12.5 = 32.5 $ meters.
- Time at constant speed = $ \frac{32.5}{5} = 6.5 $ seconds.
- Time to decelerate = 5 seconds.
- Total time to reach 10/F = $ 5 + 6.5 + 5 = 16.5 $ seconds.

### **Step 4: Determine the time to reach 30/F**
- Time to accelerate to max speed = 5 seconds.
- Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.
- Remaining distance = $ 145 - 12.5 = 132.5 $ meters.
- Time at constant speed = $ \frac{132.5}{5} = 26.5 $ seconds.
- Time to decelerate = 5 seconds.
- Total time to reach 30/F = $ 5 + 26.5 + 5 = 36.5 $ seconds.

### **Step 5: Determine the total time for the lift to go from 1/F to 30/F and stop at 10/F**
- The lift will go from 1/F to 10/F, then continue to 30/F.
- So, the total time is the time to go from 1/F to 30/F = **36.5 seconds**.

### ✅ **Answer to Question 2: 36.5 seconds**

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### **Step 1: Determine the minimum time to reach 40/F without stopping**
- From 1/F to 40/F = 39 floors.
- Distance = $ 39 \times 5 = 195 $ meters.
- Time = 44 seconds (as calculated in Question 1).

### **Step 2: Determine the minimum time if the lift must stop at another floor**
- To minimize time, the lift should stop at the **closest floor** to 40/F, i.e., **39/F**.
- So, the lift goes from 1/F to 39/F, then to 40/F.

### **Step 3: Calculate time from 1/F to 39/F**
- Distance = $ 38 \times 5 = 190 $ meters.
- Time = $ \frac{190}{5} = 38 $ seconds (constant speed only, since it doesn't need to accelerate or decelerate at the end).

### **Step 4: Calculate time from 39/F to 40/F**
- Distance = 5 meters.
- Time = $ \frac{5}{5} = 1 $ second.

### **Step 5: Total time**
- Total time = time from 1/F to 39/F + time from 39/F to 40/F
- Total time = $ 38 + 1 = 39 $ seconds.
