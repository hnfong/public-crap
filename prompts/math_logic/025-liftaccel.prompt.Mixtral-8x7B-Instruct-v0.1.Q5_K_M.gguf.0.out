Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?
 [/INST] 1. To find out how long it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider both the acceleration phase and the constant speed phase.

The lift first accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s, which takes time = final velocity / acceleration = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2 = 5 s.

Then, the lift travels at constant speed for the height of the building, which is 40 floors * 5 m/floor = 200 m. Time = distance / speed = 200 m / 5 m/s = 40 s.

Finally, the lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, which takes the same time as the acceleration phase: 5 s.

Therefore, the total time is 5 s (acceleration) + 40 s (constant speed) + 5 s (deceleration) = 50 s.

2. When the lift reaches the 10th floor, the first person gets out. Until then, the lift has been accelerating, reaching its top speed, and traveling with constant speed, just like in question 1, so it has been 5 s (acceleration) + 5 s (time to reach top speed) = 10 s.

Then, the lift starts decelerating to stop at the 10th floor, which takes the same time as the acceleration phase: 5 s.

The second person wants to go to the 30th floor. The lift needs to travel an additional 30 floors * 5 m/floor = 150 m. Time = distance / speed = 150 m / 5 m/s = 30 s.

Therefore, the total time is 10 s (first part of journey) + 5 s (deceleration and stopping at 10/F) + 30 s (second part of journey) = 45 s.

3. The lift needs to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's say it stops at the k-th floor, where 1 < k < 40.

The time for the lift to reach the k-th floor is the same as in question 2: 10 s (acceleration, reaching top speed, and traveling with constant speed) + 5 s (deceleration and stopping at k/F).

Then, the lift needs to accelerate again to reach the 40th floor. The additional height to travel is (40 - k) * 5 m/floor = 5(40 - k) m. Time = distance / acceleration = 5(40 - k) m / 1 m/s^2 = 5(40 - k) s.

Therefore, the minimum time is 10 s (first part of journey) + 5 s (stopping at k/F) + 5(40 - k) s (second part of journey) = 20 s + 5(40 - k) s.

Since k is between 1 and 40, the minimum time is achieved when k is closest to 1, i.e., k = 2. So, the minimum time is 20 s + 5(40 - 2) s = 20 s + 190 s = 210 s. [end of text]
