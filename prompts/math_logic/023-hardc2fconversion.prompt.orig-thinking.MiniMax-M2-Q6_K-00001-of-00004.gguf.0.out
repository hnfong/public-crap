I need to explain the phrase about converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, specifically the idea that "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." This seems to refer to a pattern where the digits of the Celsius temperature are reversed in Fahrenheit. For example, 12°C converts to 54°F, and 21°C converts to 69.8°F. However, I realize that 21°C actually converts to 69.8°F, not 12°F. I need to clarify this further!

I’m looking into the phrase about converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, specifically the idea that "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." It seems to suggest that when you add 12°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature reverse. For example, 12°C converts to 54°F, and 24°C converts to 75.2°F. However, I realize that 24°C actually converts to 75.2°F, not 48°F. I need to clarify this pattern further!
