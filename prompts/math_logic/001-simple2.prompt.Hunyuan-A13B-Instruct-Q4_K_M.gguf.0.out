### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is a highly significant number in mathematics and has many interesting properties. Here are some of them:

1. **Factorial**:  
   $120 = 5$, which means $120 = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. It is the factorial of 5.

2. **Divisibility**:  
   - It is divisible by all integers from 1 to 10 except 7.  
   - It has 16 divisors: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120$.

3. **Sum of Divisors**:  
   The sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 192$, which is greater than 120. This makes 120 an **abundant number**.

4. **Triangular Number**:  
   $120$ is a triangular number because it can be expressed as $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for some integer $n$. Specifically, $120 = \frac{15 \times 16}{2}$, so it is the 15th triangular number.

5. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   $120$ is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.

6. **Number of Permutations**:  
   The number of permutations of 5 distinct items is $5\% = 120$.

7. **Number of Minutes in 2 Hours**:  
   $120$ minutes make 2 hours, which is a common time duration.

8. **Number of Seconds in 2 Minutes**:  
   $120$ seconds make 2 minutes, which is a common time duration.

9. **Number of Degrees in a Pentagon**:  
   A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the sum of its interior angles is $120^\circ$.

10. **Historical Significance**:  
    - In 120 seconds, a person can perform many physical activities.  
    - In 120 minutes, a person can watch a movie or take a short trip.  
    - In 120 years, a person can experience significant life changes.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

To solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$, we can use the **quadratic formula** or **factoring**. Let's try factoring first.

#### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic equation
We need two numbers that multiply to $-18$ (the constant term) and add to $-7$ (the coefficient of $x$).

The pairs of factors of $-18$ are:
- $-1$ and $18$ (sum = $17$)
- $1$ and $-18$ (sum = $-17$)
- $-2$ and $9$ (sum = $7$)
- $2$ and $-9$ (sum = $-7$)

The pair $2$ and $-9$ works because their sum is $-7$. So, we can write:
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2)
$$

#### Step 2: Solve for $x$
Set each factor equal to zero:
$$
x - 9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
$$
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

#### Final Answer:
The solutions are:
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
$$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

#### Step 1: Calculate the time for one round trip
- The distance between the two cities is $200 \, \text{km}$.
- A round trip covers $200 \, \text{km} \times 2 = 400 \, \text{km}$.
- The train travels at $60 \, \text{km/h}$, so the time for one round trip is:
$$
\text{Time for one round trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours} \, (\text{or } 6 \, \text{hours and } 40 \, \text{minutes}).
$$

#### Step 2: Calculate the number of round trips in a full day
- A full day has $24 \, \text{hours}$.
- The number of round trips the train can make is:
$$
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time in a day}}{\text{Time for one round trip}} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

#### Final Answer:
The train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day.
