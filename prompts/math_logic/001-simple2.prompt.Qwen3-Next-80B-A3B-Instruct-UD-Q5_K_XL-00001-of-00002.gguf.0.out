Let’s go through each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number **120** has several interesting mathematical and cultural properties:

### Mathematical Properties:

1. **Factorial Number**:  
   120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = **120**  
   → It is the factorial of 5, which makes it significant in combinatorics.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   120 has **16 divisors**:  
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 → **18 divisors**  
   → It is a **highly composite number** (more divisors than any smaller positive integer).

3. **Triangular Number**:  
   120 is the **15th triangular number**:  
   T₁₅ = 15×16/2 = 120 → So it’s the sum of the first 15 natural numbers.

4. **Factorial and Combinatorics**:  
   Since 5! = 120, it represents the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects.

5. **Polygonal Numbers**:  
   120 is also a **harmonic divisor number** (its divisors have a harmonic mean that is an integer).

6. **Cultural Significance**:  
   - In time: 120 minutes = 2 hours.  
   - In sports: A rugby match has two 40-minute halves → 80 minutes total, but 120 minutes is common in knockout matches (e.g., rugby extra time).  
   - In religion: 120 is the number of people in the upper room before Pentecost (Acts 1:15).  
   - In ancient measurements: 120 talents = a large unit in ancient weights.

✅ **Summary of Interesting Properties**:
- 5! = 120
- 15th triangular number: 1+2+...+15 = 120
- Highly composite number (18 divisors)
- Appears in religion, sports, time, and combinatorics

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

We solve the quadratic equation:  
**x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

### Step 1: Factor the quadratic
We need two numbers that:
- Multiply to **-18**
- Add to **-7**

Let’s list factor pairs of -18:
- 1 and -18 → sum = -17
- -1 and 18 → sum = 17
- **-9 and 2** → -9 + 2 = **-7** ✅
- Product: -9 × 2 = -18 ✅

So we factor as:
> x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

### Step 2: Solve each factor
Set each factor equal to zero:

1. x - 9 = 0 → **x = 9**  
2. x + 2 = 0 → **x = -2**

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**x = 9 or x = -2**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

### Step 1: Understand what a round trip is
- One-way distance = 200 km  
- Round trip = going and returning = 200 km × 2 = **400 km**

### Step 2: Speed of train = 60 km/h

We want to find how many **round trips** it can make in **24 hours**.

### Step 3: Time for one round trip

Distance per round trip = 400 km  
Speed = 60 km/h

Time for one round trip = Distance / Speed  
= 400 km / 60 km/h  
= 400 ÷ 60 = **20/3 hours** ≈ 6.666... hours

### Step 4: Total time available = 24 hours

Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip  
= 24 ÷ (20/3)  
= 24 × (3/20)  
= (24 × 3) / 20  
= 72 / 20  
= **3.6**

### Step 5: Interpret the result

The train can make **3.6 round trips** in 24 hours.

But since we can’t make a partial round trip in practical terms (unless we count partial trips), and the question says “how many round trips can it make”, we assume **complete round trips only**.

So, **3.6** means it completes **3 full round trips**, and is 60% through the 4th trip.

But since the question asks **how many round trips can it make**, and typically this means **complete** round trips, the answer is:

> **3 complete round trips**

But let’s double-check the math:

- Time for one round trip = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.6667 hours  
- Total time = 24 hours  
- Number of round trips = 24 ÷ (20/3) = 24 × 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = **3.6**

So in 24 hours, it can complete **3 full round trips**, and start a 4th, but not finish it.

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 complete round trips**

But note: sometimes in math problems, if not specified to round down, they may accept the exact value. But since the question says “how many round trips can it make”, and a “round trip” implies completion, the answer is:

> ✅ **3**
