There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

ASSISTANT:  Let's solve each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

First, we need to calculate the total vertical distance the lift must travel. Since the building has 40 stories and each story is 5 meters tall, the total height is:

\[ \text{Total height} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we'll use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion that relates distance (s), acceleration (a), and time (t):

\[ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

We know the lift's acceleration/deceleration is \( 1 \text{m/s}^2 \), and its maximum speed cannot exceed \( 5 \text{m/s} \). Since the lift starts from rest, its initial speed \( u \) is \( 0 \text{m/s} \). We'll solve for time \( t \):

\[ 200 \text{ meters} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{m/s}^2 \times t^2 \]

\[ t^2 = \frac{200 \text{ meters}}{0.5 \text{m/s}^2} \]

\[ t^2 = 400 \text{ seconds}^2 \]

\[ t = \sqrt{400} \text{ seconds} \]

\[ t = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it takes 20 seconds for the lift to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

First, we calculate the distance the lift must travel to the 10th floor:

\[ s_1 = 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \]

Then, from the 10th floor to the 30th floor:

\[ s_2 = 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 100 \text{ meters} \]

The total distance is:

\[ s_{\text{total}} = s_1 + s_2 = 50 \text{ meters} + 100 \text{ meters} = 150 \text{ meters} \]

Using the same kinematic equation as before:

\[ s_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

\[ 150 \text{ meters} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{m/s}^2 \times t^2 \]

\[ t^2 = \frac{150 \text{ meters}}{0.5 \text{m/s}^2} \]

\[ t = \sqrt{\frac{150 \text{ meters}}{0.5 \text{m/s}^2}} \]

\[ t = \sqrt{300} \text{ seconds} \]

\[ t = 17.32 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it takes approximately 17.32 seconds for the lift to stop at both the 10th and 30th floors.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the highest convenient floor. The second person gets off at the floor just below the maximum height to allow for deceleration without exceeding the maximum speed of the lift.

Let's assume the second person gets off at the 39th floor. The lift will then have to decelerate from its maximum speed to stop at the 40th floor.

First, we calculate the distance the lift must travel to the 39th floor:

\[ s_1 = 39 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 195 \text{ meters} \]

Then, from the 39th floor to the 40th floor:

\[ s_2 = 1 \text{ floor} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 5 \text{ meters} \]

The total distance is:

\[ s_{\text{total}} = s_1 + s_2 = 195 \text{ meters} + 5 \text{ meters} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

The lift is traveling at its maximum speed \( v \) just before it starts to decelerate. We'll use the following kinematic equation that relates distance, acceleration, and initial velocity:

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \]

We know \( u = 5 \text{m/s} \), \( a = -1 \text{m/s}^2 \) (negative because it's deceleration), and \( s = 5 \text{ meters} \). Solving for \( t \) gives us the time the lift takes to decelerate from its maximum speed to a stop:

\[ 5 \text{ meters} = 5 \text{m/s} \times t - \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{m/s}^2 \times t^2 \]

\[ 0 = 5t - 0.5t^2 + 5 \]

\[ 0.5t^2 - 5t + 5 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula, \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), we get two solutions, but we are interested in the positive one since the lift cannot travel back in time:

\[ t = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 2 \times 0.5 \times 5}}{1} \]

\[ t = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{37.5}}{1} \]

\[ t = \frac{5 \pm 5.59}{1} \]

We take the positive root because the lift is already at 5 m/s when it starts to decelerate:

\[ t = \frac{5 + 5.59}{1} \]

\[ t = 10.59 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to travel from the ground floor to the 39th floor:

\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 \]

\[ t_{\text{total}} = 17.32 \text{ seconds} + 10.59 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ t_{\text{total}} = 27.91 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor with one person going to the top and another getting off at the 39th floor is approximately 27.91 seconds. [end of text]
