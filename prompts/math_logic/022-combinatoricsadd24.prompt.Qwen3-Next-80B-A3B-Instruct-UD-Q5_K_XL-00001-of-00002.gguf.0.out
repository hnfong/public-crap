Let's carefully work through this with the numbers: **4, 3, 1, 8** — we must use **each exactly once** to make **24**.

Let’s try different combinations.

---

**Attempt 1:**  
Try: `(8 - 4) * (3 + 1)`  
→ `4 * 4 = 16` → too low.  
Already tried. Not 24.

---

**Attempt 2:**  
Try: `8 * 3 = 24`, then what about 4 and 1?  
We have to use **all four numbers**: 4, 3, 1, 8.

What if we do:  
`8 * 3 = 24`, and then `(4 - 1) = 3` — but we already used 8 and 3.  
We need to use **all four numbers**: 4, 3, 1, 8 — each exactly once.

Try:  
What if we do:  
`(8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16` → too low.

What about:  
`8 * (4 - 1) = 8 * 3 = 24` → but we haven’t used the **1**.  
We used 8, 4, 3 — but 3 is not in the original set! Wait — original numbers are: **4, 3, 1, 8**

Ah! We have **3**! So:

Try:  
`8 * 3 = 24`, and then we have 4 and 1 left.  
We need to **use all four numbers**.

Can we do:  
`(8 * 3) + (1 - 4)` → 24 + (-3) = 21 → no  
Or `(8 * 3) * (1) + (4 - 4)` — but we don’t have two 4s.

Wait — we have: **4, 3, 1, 8**

Try this:  
What is `(4 + 8) * (1 + 1)`? — but we don’t have two 1s.

Wait — try this classic trick:  
What is `8 / (1 - 3/4)`?

Let’s compute that:

First, `3/4 = 0.75`  
Then `1 - 0.75 = 0.25`  
Then `8 / 0.25 = 32` → too big.

Wait — what if we do:  
`(8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16` — already tried.

Wait — what about:  
**8 * 3 = 24**, and then **4 and 1** — can we make them cancel?  
Like: `8 * 3 + (1 - 1)` — but we don’t have two 1s.

Wait — what if we do:  
**(4 * 8) - (3 + 1) = 32 - 4 = 28** — too big.

Wait — try this:

What is **(3 - 1) * (8 + 4)**?  
→ 2 * 12 = 24 → YES!

Let’s check:  
We used: **3, 1, 8, 4**

Expression:  
**(3 - 1) * (8 + 4) = 2 * 12 = 24**

Numbers used: **3, 1, 8, 4** — exactly the numbers given!

✅ Perfect.

**Final Answer:**

```
Attempt: (3 - 1) * (8 + 4) = 2 * 12 = 24
Double checking: (3 - 1) = 2, (8 + 4) = 12, 2 * 12 = 24. Numbers used: 3, 1, 8, 4 — all used exactly once. Correct!
