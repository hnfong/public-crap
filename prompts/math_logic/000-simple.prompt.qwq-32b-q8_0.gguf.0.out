Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll start with the first few to get warmed up.

Q1: 1+1=?
That's straightforward. 1 plus 1 is 2. Easy.

Q2: 6*7=?
Hmm, 6 times 7. Let me think. 6*6 is 36, so adding another 6 makes 42. Yeah, 42.

Q3: 83*59=?
This might be trickier. Let me break it down. 80*59 is 4720, and 3*59 is 177. Adding those together: 4720 + 177 = 4897? Wait, let me check again. 80*50 is 4000, 80*9 is 720, so 4000+720=4720. Then 3*50=150 and 3*9=27, so 150+27=177. 4720+177 is indeed 4897. Okay, that seems right.

Q4: 349*683=?
Oh, this is a big multiplication. Maybe I can use the standard algorithm. Let's see:

First, multiply 349 by 600: 349*600 = 209,400.

Then 349*80 = 27,920.

Then 349*3 = 1,047.

Adding them all together: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320. Then +1,047 gives 238,367? Wait, let me check again. Maybe I made an addition error. 209,400 +27,920: 209,400 +20,000 is 229,400, plus 7,920 is 237,320. Then adding 1,047: 237,320 +1,000 is 238,320, plus 47 is 238,367. Hmm, but I might have messed up the initial multiplication steps. Alternatively, maybe I should do it another way. Let me try 349*683:

Alternatively, 349*(700 - 17) = 349*700 - 349*17. 349*700 is 244,300. 349*17: 300*17=5,100; 49*17=833. So total 5,100+833=5,933. So 244,300 -5,933 = 238,367. Okay, same result. So maybe that's correct. I think that's right.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
Whoa, this is a huge number. I might need to approximate or use a calculator, but since I can't, maybe I can break it down. Let me see:

6043 * 7489. Let's think of 6043 as 6000 + 43, and 7489 as 7000 + 489.

So (6000 +43)*(7000 +489) = 6000*7000 + 6000*489 +43*7000 +43*489.

Calculating each term:

6000*7000 = 42,000,000

6000*489 = 6000*400 + 6000*89 = 2,400,000 + 534,000 = 2,934,000

43*7000 = 301,000

43*489: Let's compute 40*489 = 19,560 and 3*489=1,467. So total 19,560 +1,467 =21,027.

Now add all these together:

42,000,000 + 2,934,000 = 44,934,000

Add 301,000: 44,934,000 +301,000 =45,235,000

Add 21,027: 45,235,000 +21,027 =45,256,027.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method. Alternatively, maybe I can use (a+b)(c+d) but I think the calculation is correct. Hmm, but I might have messed up a step. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 45,256,027? Not sure, but I'll go with that for now.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

Okay, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22-7 =15. Then divide by 3: x=5. That seems straightforward.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?

25% is a quarter, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So 20.

Q8: The book is $15. I give two 20s ($40) and an additional $5, so total given is $45. The cost is $15, so change should be 45-15=30. But the question says "the final change the shopkeeper should give me". Since she didn't have exact change initially, but after adding the $5, the total given is $45, so the change is $30. So the answer is $30.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side 5 units. Perimeter is 4 times side, so 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. So her siblings are two brothers and one sister, making three siblings. Including Katherine herself, the mother has four children. So the answer is 4.

Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 ÷ 4 -1. Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷4 is 3. So the expression becomes 3 +3 -1 = 5. Wait, 3+3 is 6, minus 1 is 5. Correct.

Q12: Tom's guests: 5 have arrived. How many cake slices needed? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. Usually, each person gets one slice, so 5 slices. But maybe the question expects a standard number like 8 slices per cake? Wait, but the question doesn't specify the cake's size or how many slices per cake. Since it's not given, maybe the answer is 5 slices. But maybe it's a trick question? Hmm, maybe I should say 5, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question says "how many slices do they need", so assuming each guest wants one slice, then 5. I'll go with 5.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. So discount is 20% of 25, which is 5. So sale price is 25-5=20. So $20.

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM. Let's calculate the time difference. From 3:45 to 6:30. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But since it's only to 6:30, subtract 15 minutes. So 180-15=165 minutes. Alternatively, 3:45 to 6:30: 2 hours 45 minutes from 3:45 to 6:30? Wait, let me do it step by step. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours (180 minutes). But we need to go to 6:30, which is 15 minutes earlier. So total is 180 -15 = 165 minutes. So 165 minutes left.

Q15: Taxi can carry 4 passengers. 22 people. How many taxis needed? 22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis would carry 20, leaving 2 people needing another taxi. So 6.

Q16: Triangle angles. Two angles are 31 and 62. Sum of angles in a triangle is 180. So third angle is 180 - (31+62) = 180 -93 =87 degrees. So 87°.

Wait, let me check again:

31 +62 =93. 180-93=87. Yes.

Okay, I think I have all the answers. Let me just go through each again quickly to confirm.

Q1: 2. Q2:42. Q3:4897. Q4:238,367. Q5:45,256,027. Q6:5. Q7:20. Q8:30. Q9:20. Q10:4. Q11:5. Q12:5. Q13:20. Q14:165. Q15:6. Q16:87. 

I think most of these are correct. The big multiplications might be error-prone, but I tried to verify them. Q5 is a huge number, so I might have messed up a step there, but I'll go with the answer I got. Q12 is a bit ambiguous, but I think 5 is the answer. Alright, let's put them all in the answer now.
