Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with the first one, 1+1. That's straightforward, right? 1 plus 1 is 2. Easy enough.

Next, 6 multiplied by 7. Hmm, 6 times 7... I remember that 6 times 5 is 30, so adding another 6*2=12 gives 42. So 6*7 is 42.

Now, 83 times 59. This might be a bit trickier. Let me think. Maybe break it down: 80*59 plus 3*59. 80*59 is 4720, and 3*59 is 177. Adding those together gives 4720 + 177 = 4897? Wait, let me check again. 80*60 would be 4800, so subtract 80 gives 4720. Then 3*59 is 177. 4720+177 is indeed 4897. Okay, that seems right.

349 multiplied by 683. Oh, this is going to be a big number. Let me see if I can do this step by step. Maybe use the standard multiplication method. 349 times 600 is 209,400. Then 349 times 80 is 27,920. Then 349 times 3 is 1,047. Adding all those together: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320. Then add 1,047 to get 238,367? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. 349*600 is indeed 209,400. 349*80: 349*8 is 2,792, so times 10 is 27,920. 349*3 is 1,047. Adding those: 209,400 +27,920 = 237,320. Then 237,320 +1,047 = 238,367. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But I might have messed up the addition steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way, but I'll go with that for now.

6043 multiplied by 7489. Wow, that's a huge number. I might not be able to compute this exactly without a calculator. Let me see if I can approximate or maybe use some method. Alternatively, maybe the question expects an approximate answer, but since the user wants the exact answer, I might have to say I'm not sure here. Alternatively, maybe I can break it down. Let's see: 6000*7000 = 42,000,000. Then 6000*489 = 6000*400=2,400,000 plus 6000*89=534,000, so total 2,934,000. Then 43*7000=301,000. Then 43*489. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just say I'm not sure about this one. Let me note that for later.

Question 6: Solve 3x +7 =22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x=15. Then divide by 3: x=5. That seems straightforward.

Q7: 25% of 80. 25% is a quarter, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So 20.

Q8: The book is $15. The person gives two $20 bills, so that's $40. The total cost is $15, so the change should be $40 - $15 = $25. But the shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so the person gives an additional $5. Wait, the question says "I give her an additional five dollar bill." So total given is $40 + $5 = $45. Then the total cost is $15, so the change should be $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again. "I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill." So the total given is two 20s (40) plus a 5, totaling 45. The book is 15, so the change should be 45-15=30. So the final change is $30. Hmm, that seems right.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side 5 units. Perimeter is 4 times the side, so 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Well, Katherine plus two brothers and one sister makes 1+2+1=4 children. Wait, but wait: if Katherine has two brothers and a sister, that means her siblings are two brothers and one sister, so total siblings are three, plus herself makes four. So the answer is 4.

Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 ÷4 -1. Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷4 is 3. So the expression becomes 3 +3 -1 = 5. So the answer is 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Hmm, this is ambiguous. It depends on how many slices each person wants, but maybe the question assumes one slice per person? But the question doesn't specify. Maybe it's a trick question, but perhaps the answer is 5 slices. Alternatively, maybe the cake is divided into a certain number of slices, but without more info, I think the answer is 5. But I'm not sure. Maybe the question expects that, but I should note that.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. The discount is 20% of 25, which is 5. So sale price is 25-5=20. So $20.

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM. Let's calculate the time difference. From 3:45 to 6:30. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But since it's only to 6:30, subtract 15 minutes. So 180-15=165 minutes. Alternatively, 3:45 to 6:30: 2 hours 45 minutes from 3:45 to 6:30? Wait, let me do it step by step. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours (180 minutes). But we need to go to 6:30, which is 15 minutes earlier. So total is 180 -15 = 165 minutes. So 165 minutes left.

Q15: Taxi can carry 4 passengers. 22 people. How many taxis needed? 22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis would carry 20, leaving 2 people needing another taxi. So 6.

Q16: Triangle with two angles 31 and 62. The third angle. Sum of angles in a triangle is 180. So 31 +62 =93. 180-93=87 degrees. So 87 degrees.

Now, going back to Q5: 6043*7489. Since I couldn't compute that exactly earlier, maybe I can try again. Let me see if there's a better way. Let's break it down:

6043 * 7489 = (6000 + 43) * (7000 + 489)

Multiply using distributive property:

6000*7000 = 42,000,000

6000*489 = 6000*400 + 6000*89 = 2,400,000 + 534,000 = 2,934,000

43*7000 = 301,000

43*489 = let's compute 43*400 = 17,200; 43*89 = 3,847. So total 17,200 +3,847 =21,047

Now add all these parts together:

42,000,000 + 2,934,000 = 44,934,000

44,934,000 + 301,000 = 45,235,000

45,235,000 +21,047 = 45,256,047

Wait, but let me check again:

Wait, 6000*489 is 2,934,000. Then 43*7000 is 301,000. Adding those two gives 2,934,000 +301,000 = 3,235,000. Then adding to 42,000,000 gives 45,235,000. Then adding 43*489=21,047 gives 45,235,000 +21,047 =45,256,047. Hmm, so that's the total. But I might have made an arithmetic error here. Alternatively, maybe I should confirm with another method. Alternatively, perhaps I should just go with that number, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me see if there's another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use (a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. So that's exactly what I did. So unless I messed up the multiplication steps, that should be correct. Let me check 43*489 again. 43*400 is 17,200. 43*89: 40*89=3,560 and 3*89=267, so total 3,560+267=3,827. Wait, that's different from my previous 3,847. Wait, 43*89: 40*89 is 3560, plus 3*89=267, so total 3560+267=3827. So 17,200 +3,827 =21,027. So that would make the total 45,235,000 +21,027 =45,256,027. Hmm, so I had a miscalculation there. So maybe the correct total is 45,256,027? Wait, let me recalculate 43*489 again step by step:

489 *43:

First, 489*40 = 19,560

Then 489*3 = 1,467

Adding those: 19,560 +1,467 =21,027. Yes, so that's correct. So the total would be 42,000,000 +2,934,000 =44,934,000; plus 301,000 gives 45,235,000; plus 21,027 gives 45,256,027. So the correct answer is 45,256,027. But I might have made a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, maybe I should just note that I'm not sure but think it's around that number. Alternatively, perhaps I should just say I'm not sure because it's a big multiplication. Hmm, but given that I did the steps, maybe I can put that as the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should check with another method. Let me try 6043*7489:

Alternatively, 6043 *7489 = (6000 +43)*(7000 +489). Wait, but 7489 is 7000+489, yes. So the calculation seems right. So I think the answer is 45,256,027. But I'm not 100% sure, so maybe I should say "I think the answer is 45,256,027".

Now, going back to Q12: the cake slices. The question says "how many slices do they need?" Without more info, maybe it's expecting 5 slices, one per guest. But maybe the question is a trick, like the cake is already cut into a certain number, but since it's not stated, I think the answer is 5. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting that each person gets a slice, so 5. So I'll go with 5.

Alright, let me compile all the answers now.
