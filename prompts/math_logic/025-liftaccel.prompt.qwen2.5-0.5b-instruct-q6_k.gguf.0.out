There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To solve these questions, we need to calculate the time it takes for a person to travel from one floor to the next in the elevator. Let's go through each question step by step.

### 1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

The elevator travels from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) with a maximum speed of 5 m/s. The distance between these two floors is 40 meters.

The time \( t \) it takes to travel a distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ t = \frac{40 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 8 \text{ s} \]

So, the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:
\[ \boxed{8 \text{ s}} \]

### 2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

First, we need to determine the time it takes for the first person to travel from 1/F to 10/F. The distance between these two floors is 9 meters.

Using the same formula:
\[ t_1 = \frac{9 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 1.8 \text{ s} \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for the second person to travel from 10/F to 30/F. The distance between these two floors is 20 meters.

Using the same formula:
\[ t_2 = \frac{20 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 4 \text{ s} \]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) for both people to travel from 1/F to 30/F is:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = 1.8 \text{ s} + 4 \text{ s} = 5.8 \text{ s} \]

So, the total time it takes for the two people to travel from 1/F to 30/F is:
\[ \boxed{5.8 \text{ s}} \]

### 3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

The elevator travels from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F) with a maximum speed of 5 m/s. The distance between these two floors is 40 meters.

The time \( t \) it takes to travel a distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ t = \frac{40 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 8 \text{ s} \]

However, the elevator has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. The distance between these two floors is 39 meters (40 - 1).

Using the same formula:
\[ t = \frac{39 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 7.8 \text{ s} \]

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is:
\[ \boxed{7.8 \text{ s}} \] [end of text]
