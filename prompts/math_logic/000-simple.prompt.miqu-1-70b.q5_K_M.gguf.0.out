 A1: The answer is 2.

A2: The answer is 42.

A3: The answer is 4917.

A4: I'm not sure, but I think the answer is 236807, which can be obtained by using a calculator.

A5: I'm not sure, but I think the answer is 45152057, which can be obtained by using a calculator.

A6: The answer is x = 5. You can find this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, which gives you 3x = 15, and then dividing both sides by 3.

A7: The answer is 20. To find this, you can multiply 25% (which is 0.25 as a decimal) by 80.

A8: The answer is $25. Since you gave the shopkeeper $50 and the book costs $15, you should get $35 in change. However, since you gave an additional $5, the shopkeeper should return $10 of that, resulting in a final change of $25.

A9: The answer is 20 units. The perimeter of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

A10: The answer is 3. Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so her mother has three children.

A11: The answer is 6. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), you should perform the division before the addition and subtraction. So, 12 รท 4 = 3, and then 3 + 3 - 1 = 6.

A12: The answer is 5 slices. Each guest needs one slice of cake.

A13: The answer is $20. A 20% discount on a $25 shirt means you pay 80% of the original price, which is $20.

A14: The answer is 165 minutes. There are 135 minutes between 3:45 PM and 5:00 PM, and then another 150 minutes between 5:00 PM and 6:30 PM. However, since you've already accounted for 5:00 PM once, you should subtract 15 minutes from the total, resulting in 165 minutes.

A15: The answer is 6 taxis. Since each taxi can carry 4 passengers, you'll need 5.5 taxis for 22 people. However, since you can't have half a taxi, you'll need to round up to 6 taxis.

A16: The answer is 87 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, so the third angle must be 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
