A1: 1+1=2
A2: 6*7=42
A3: 83*59=4917
A4: 349*683=238807
A5: 6043*7489=45181207 (This is a large number, so it's best to use a calculator to confirm.)
A6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. The answer is x = 15/3 or x = 5.
A7: What is 25% of 80? The answer is 20.
A8: You gave the shopkeeper $50 and the book cost $15. You also gave an extra $5, so the shopkeeper should give you $30 back.
