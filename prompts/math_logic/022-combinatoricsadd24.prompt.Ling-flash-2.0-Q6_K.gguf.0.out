We are given the numbers: **4, 3, 1, 8**, and we must use **each exactly once** to make **24** using any mathematical operations.

Let’s try different combinations carefully.

---

**Attempt 1:**  
(8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16 → too low.  
**Retrying**

**Attempt 2:**  
8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27 → too high.  
**Retrying**

**Attempt 3:**  
4 * 3 * (8 / (something))... Let's think differently.

Try: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24 → YES!  
Check numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 → all used exactly once.

Let’s write it properly.

---

**Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24**

**Double checking:**  
(8 + 4) = 12  
(3 - 1) = 2  
12 * 2 = 24  
✅ Correct. All numbers (8, 4, 3, 1) used exactly once.

Success!

Final answer:

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Correct. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Success!
