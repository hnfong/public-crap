Got it, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: What's the significance of 120 and its interesting properties. First, I need to remember where 120 shows up. Maybe math, science, history? Let's think. In math, 120 is a factorial: 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. Oh right, factorials are important in combinatorics, permutations. Then it's a highly composite number? Wait, highly composite numbers have more divisors than any smaller number. Let's check divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors, which is more than, say, 60 (12 divisors) or 90 (12), so yes, highly composite. Good for measurements because it has many factors, like units of time—60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 12 hours on a clock, 120 is 2×60, maybe related to that? Also, in geometry, the icosahedron has 120 edges? Wait no, icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, 20 faces. Maybe the number of degrees in a full circle is 360, which is 3×120, so 120 degrees is a third of a circle, important in angles. In physics, maybe atomic numbers? No, uranium is 92, lead is 82. Wait, 120 is the atomic number of unbinilium, a synthetic element, but that's less common. In history, maybe the 120 Apostles? Or the 120 years of Solomon's reign? No, maybe not. Also, in music, the octave has 12 semitones, 120 could be related to frequencies? Maybe not. Let me confirm factorial: 5! is definitely 120. Highly composite: yes, as it's 2^3×3×5, so exponents are 3,1,1, which makes it highly composite. Also, 120 is the smallest number divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6—let's check: LCM of 1-6 is 60? Wait no, LCM(1-6) is 60, because 60 is divisible by 1-6, 120 is divisible by 1-10? Let's see: 120 divisible by 7? No, 120/7≈17.14, so no. LCM(1-5) is 60, LCM(1-6) is 60, LCM(1-7) is 420. So 120 is divisible by 1-5 and 6, but not 7. Also, 120 is the product of the first 5 integers, so that's a key property. Maybe in combinatorics, the number of permutations of 5 objects is 5! = 120. That's a big one. Also, in the Bible, maybe the 120 disciples? Wait, after Jesus ascended, there were 120 waiting for the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:15), that's a religious significance. Also, in Chinese culture, 120 is a significant number? Maybe not as much as 8 or 9, but 12 is important (12 months, 12 zodiac signs), so 120 is 10×12. Okay, those are some points.

Q2: Solve x² -7x -18 = 0. Quadratic equation. Can factor, complete the square, or quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first. We need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Let's see: factors of -18: possible pairs (1,-18)= -17, (2,-9)= -7. Oh, 2 and -9: 2×(-9)= -18, 2 + (-9)= -7. Perfect. So the equation factors as (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0. Let me check: (x+2)(x-9)=x² -9x +2x -18 = x² -7x -18. Correct. So solutions are x = -2 and x = 9. Alternatively, quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)]/2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2. So (7+11)/2=18/2=9, (7-11)/2=-4/2=-2. Same result.

Q3: Train travels at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips in a full day? First, need to figure out time per round trip. Round trip is going there and back, so distance per round trip is 2×200=400 km. Speed is 60 km/h, so time = distance/speed. So time per round trip is 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 hours = 6 and 2/3 hours, which is 6 hours 40 minutes. Wait, but wait: is it one way distance 200 km, so one way time is 200/60 = 10/3 hours ≈3.333 hours. So round trip is 2×(10/3)=20/3≈6.666... hours per round trip. Now, a full day is 24 hours. So number of round trips is total time divided by time per round trip: 24 / (20/3) = 24×(3/20)=72/20=3.6. But wait, can it make a fraction of a round trip? The question says "how many round trips can it make". Since it's a full day, and time stationed is negligible, so we need to see if 3 round trips take how much time: 3×(20/3)=20 hours. Then remaining time is 24-20=4 hours. In 4 hours, how far can it go? 60 km/h×4h=240 km. Which is more than one way (200 km), so it can go one way (200 km) in 200/60=10/3≈3.333 hours, then have 4 - 10/3= (12/3 -10/3)=2/3 hours left, which is 40 minutes, but that's not a full round trip. A round trip is going and coming back, so 3 full round trips take 20 hours, then in the remaining 4 hours, it can do one way, but not the return. So the question is "how many round trips", so round trips are complete there and back. So 3 round trips? Wait, but 24/(20/3)=3.6, so 3 full round trips, and 0.6 of a round trip, but 0.6 isn't a full one. Wait, let's check again: one way time: 200 km /60 km/h = 3 hours 20 minutes (since 60×3=180, 20 km left is 20/60=1/3 hour=20 minutes, so 3h20m). Round trip is 6h40m. 3 round trips: 3×6h40m=20h. Then 24h-20h=4h left. 4 hours is 4h, which is 3h20m (one way) plus 40m, so it can go from city A to B (3h20m), then start back, but only have 40m left, which isn't enough to get back. So it can't complete a fourth round trip. Therefore, the number of round trips is 3? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming "round trip" is there and back. The question says "round trips between the two cities", so yes, round trip is A to B to A. So 3 round trips take 20 hours, 4 hours remaining, not enough for another round trip. So answer is 3? Wait, but let's confirm with math: 24 hours divided by time per round trip (20/3 hours) is 3.6, so the integer part is 3, since you can't have a fraction of a round trip. So that's 3.</seed:think>### Q1: Significance and Interesting Properties of 120  

#### Mathematical Properties:  
- **Factorial**: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\), making it the product of the first 5 positive integers. This is critical in combinatorics (e.g., permutations of 5 objects).  
- **Highly Composite Number**: It has more divisors than any smaller number. Divisors of 120 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 total), which makes it useful for measurements (e.g., dividing time or quantities evenly).  
- **Divisibility**: The smallest number divisible by 1 through 6 (LCM of 1–6 is 60, but 120 is the next highly composite number after 60).  

#### Other Significance:  
- **Time/Angles**: 120 degrees is a third of a full circle (360°), important in geometry and navigation.  
- **Religion/History**: In the New Testament, 120 disciples waited for the Holy Spirit in the Upper Room (Acts 1:15).  
- **Chemistry**: Unbinilium (element 120) is a synthetic radioactive element with the symbol Ubn.  


### Q2: Solve \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)  

This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Here, we use factoring:  

- We need two numbers that multiply to \(-18\) and add to \(-7\). The pair \((2, -9)\) works: \(2 \times (-9) = -18\) and \(2 + (-9) = -7\).  
- Factor the equation: \((x + 2)(x - 9) = 0\).  

Setting each factor to zero gives the solutions:  
\(x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2\)  
\(x - 9 = 0 \implies x = 9\)  

**Solutions:** \(x = -2\) and \(x = 9\).  


### Q3: Number of Round Trips in a Day  

#### Step 1: Calculate one-way time  
Distance between cities = 200 km, speed = 60 km/h.  
Time for one way: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3}\) hours (≈3 hours 20 minutes).  

#### Step 2: Round-trip time  
A round trip (there and back) covers \(2 \times 200 = 400\) km.  
Time per round trip: \(2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}\) hours (≈6 hours 40 minutes).  

#### Step 3: Total round trips in 24 hours  
Total time available = 24 hours.  
Number of round trips: \(\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = 3.6\).  

Since a "round trip" requires completing both directions, we take the integer part (3 full round trips). The remaining 4 hours (24 - 20 = 4 hours) are insufficient for another full round trip (needs 6 hours 40 minutes).  

**Answer:** 3 round trips.  


**Final Answers:**  
Q1: See properties above.  
Q2: \(x = -2\) and \(x = 9\).  
Q3: 3. [end of text]
