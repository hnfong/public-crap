- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 5.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 6.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 8.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 10.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 12.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 15.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 20.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 24.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 30.
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 40.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2
This gives us two possible solutions:
x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to know the number of hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, so the train can make 24 / 2 = 12 round trips in a day.

Here are the steps to calculate this:
1. Convert the speed from km/h to km/min by dividing by 60: 60 km/h / 60 = 1 km/min.
2. Convert the distance from km to min by dividing by the speed: 200 km / 1 km/min = 200 min.
3. Divide the number of minutes in a day (24 * 60 = 1440 min) by the time it takes to travel between the two cities (200 min) to find the number of round trips: 1440 min / 200 min = 7.2 round trips. Since we can't have a fraction of a round trip, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7 round trips.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
