"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a simplified way to remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's not an exact rule, but it can be a helpful mnemonic. Here's how it works:

1. **Starting with a Celsius temperature**: Let's say you have a Celsius temperature of 24°C. According to the mnemonic, every 12°C, the digits are inverted. So, you would take the last two digits (24) and invert them to get 42. This gives you an approximate Fahrenheit temperature of 42°F.

2. **Applying the rule**: If you have 36°C, the last two digits are 36. Inverting them gives 63, which is approximately 63°F.

3. **Limitations**: This rule doesn't apply to all Celsius temperatures. For example, if you have 0°C, inverting the digits doesn't give you a meaningful Fahrenheit temperature. Similarly, it doesn't work for temperatures like 100°C, where inverting the digits doesn't give a realistic Fahrenheit value.

Here's an example to illustrate the point:

- **Celsius**: 24°C
- **Inverted digits**: 42
- **Approximate Fahrenheit**: 42°F

- **Celsius**: 36°C
- **Inverted digits**: 63
- **Approximate Fahrenheit**: 63°F

Remember, this is a mnemonic and not a precise conversion method. For exact conversions, it's best to use a conversion formula or a calculator. <|im_end|>
