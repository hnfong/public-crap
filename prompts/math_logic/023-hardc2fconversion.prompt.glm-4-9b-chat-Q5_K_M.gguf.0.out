The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device designed to help people convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures more easily. It suggests that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the Celsius temperature can be "inverted" to get a rough estimate of the Fahrenheit temperature.

Here's how it works with an example:

Let's say you have a Celsius temperature of 24°C. According to the mnemonic, you would "invert" the digits to get 42°F. This is a rough estimate, not an exact conversion.

Here's another example:

If you have 36°C, you would invert the digits to get 63°F.

However, it's important to note that this mnemonic is a simplification and does not provide an exact conversion. The actual conversion formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

So, using the formula:

- For 24°C, the conversion would be \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 75.2°F \)
- For 36°C, the conversion would be \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 96.8°F \)

The mnemonic provides a quick and easy way to estimate the Fahrenheit temperature, but it's not precise. It's a memory aid that can be useful in situations where you need a rough approximation rather than an exact value. [end of text]
