Here are the answers and step-by-step solutions for your questions.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is a highly composite number with significant mathematical and cultural properties.

**Interesting Properties:**
1.  **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and also by 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60. It has 16 divisors in total, making it very useful for dividing things into equal parts.
2.  **Factorial:** It is equal to $5!$ (5 factorial), which is $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
3.  **Semi-Perfect Number:** It is the sum of some of its proper divisors (e.g., $60 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 120$).
4.  **Cultural Significance:**
    *   **Time:** There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes.
    *   **Geometry:** A regular dodecahedron has 120 rotational symmetries.
    *   **Biology:** The human body has roughly 120 bones in infancy (before fusion), and the average human lifespan in some historical contexts was often cited as 120 years (the biblical age of Methuselah).
    *   **Sports:** In baseball, there are 120 games in a standard season (historically, though now it is 162). In cricket, a "century" is 100, but 120 is a common target in limited-overs formats.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$, we can use the **factoring method** or the **quadratic formula**. Here, factoring is straightforward.

**Method: Factoring**
1.  We need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term ($-18$) and add up to the coefficient of the $x$ term ($-7$).
2.  Let the numbers be $a$ and $b$.
    *   $a \times b = -18$
    *   $a + b = -7$
3.  Let's list the factor pairs of -18:
    *   $1$ and $-18$ (Sum: $-17$)
    *   $-1$ and $18$ (Sum: $17$)
    *   $2$ and $-9$ (Sum: $-7$) $\rightarrow$ **This is the correct pair.**
    *   $-2$ and $9$ (Sum: $7$)
    *   $3$ and $-6$ (Sum: $-3$)
    *   $-3$ and $6$ (Sum: $3$)
4.  The numbers are $-9$ and $2$.
5.  Rewrite the equation in factored form:
    $$(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$$
6.  Set each factor to zero to solve for $x$:
    *   $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$
    *   $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

**Answer:**
The solutions are **$x = 9$** and **$x = -2$**.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1.  **Calculate the distance of one round trip:**
    *   Distance between cities (one way) = $200$ km.
    *   A round trip consists of going there and coming back.
    *   Round trip distance = $200 \text{ km} + 200 \text{ km} = 400$ km.

2.  **Calculate the time required for one round trip:**
    *   Speed = $60$ km/h.
    *   Time = $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$.
    *   Time for one round trip = $\frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}}$.
    *   Time = $\frac{40}{6}$ hours = $\frac{20}{3}$ hours $\approx 6.67$ hours.

3.  **Calculate the total time available in a full day:**
    *   1 day = $24$ hours.

4.  **Calculate the number of round trips:**
    *   Number of trips = $\frac{\text{Total Time}}{\text{Time per trip}}$.
    *   Number of trips = $\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}}$.
    *   Number of trips = $24 \times \frac{3}{20}$.
    *   Number of trips = $\frac{72}{20}$.
    *   Number of trips = $3.6$.

5.  **Interpret the result:**
    *   The train can complete 3 full round trips.
    *   It will have enough time to start a 4th trip but will not finish it within the 24-hour limit (it would complete 60% of the 4th trip).
    *   Since the question asks for "how many round trips" (implying completed trips), we take the integer part.

**Answer:**
The train can make **3** complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
