A10: Katherine's mother has 4 children (Katherine, her two brothers, and her sister).

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
A11: Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), first do the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1. So, 3 + 3 = 6, and 6 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
A12: This question does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of slices needed, as it depends on how many slices each guest will have. If each guest gets one slice, then 5 slices are needed.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
A14: From 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM is 15 minutes. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is 30 minutes. So, 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
A15: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need 6 taxis to carry 22 people.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
A16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
