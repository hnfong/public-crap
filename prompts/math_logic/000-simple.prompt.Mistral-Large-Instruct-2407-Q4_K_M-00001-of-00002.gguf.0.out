[/INST] 1. 1+1=2
2. 6*7=42
3. 83*59=4897
4. 349*683=238487
5. 6043*7489=45243887
6. Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   - Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
   - Divide by 3: x = 5
7. What is 25% of 80?
   - 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
8. I am not sure, but I think the answer is:
   - You gave the shopkeeper 45 dollars for a 15 dollar book.
   - The change should be 45 - 15 = 30 dollars.
9. Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   - Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units
10. Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   - Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children
11. Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
   - Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): 3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
12. Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   - I am not sure, but I think the answer is:
   - Assuming each guest gets one slice, they need 5 slices.
13. If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   - Sale price = Original price - (Discount percentage * Original price)
   - Sale price = 25 - (0.20 * 25) = 25 - 5 = $20
14. If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   - From 3:45 to 4:45 is 60 minutes.
   - From 4:45 to 5:45 is another 60 minutes.
   - From 5:45 to 6:30 is 45 minutes.
   - Total = 60 + 60 + 45 = 165 minutes.
15. A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   - 22 รท 4 = 5 with a remainder of 2.
   - So, 6 taxis are needed to accommodate 22 people.
16. If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
