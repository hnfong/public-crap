Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

To find the mathematical expression that results in 24, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the numbers: 4 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 18
2. Divide the sum by 2: 18 / 2 = 9
3. Multiply the result by 2: 9 * 2 = 18
4. Add the result to the original number: 18 + 16 = 24

The mathematical expression that results in 24 is 24.

Note that the correct answer is 24, not 27. This is because the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) were used incorrectly in the previous steps. [end of text]
