I'd be happy to help you with the answers!

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120?

The number 120 is significant in mathematics because it is the least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. It is also the product of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which makes it a relatively small number with many divisors.

Some interesting properties of the number 120 include:

* 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
* It is a refactorizable number, meaning it can be expressed as the product of four integers.
* 120 is also a abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.

Steps to find the significance of the number 120:

1. List the numbers 1 to 6 and find their least common multiple (LCM).
2. Find the product of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to get 120.
3. Check the properties of the number 120, such as being highly composite, refactorizable, and abundant.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve this equation, we can start by factoring the left-hand side:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x - 9) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x - 9 = 0 --> x = 9
x + 2 = 0 --> x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Steps to solve the equation:

1. Factor the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance the train travels in a day. Since the train travels at 60 km/h, it will take 200km / 60km/h = 3.33 hours to travel from one city to the other.

Since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, the train can make round trips. In one day (24 hours), the train can make:

24 hours / 3.33 hours per trip = 7.22 trips

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the train can make 7 round trips within a full day.

Steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the time it takes to travel from one city to the other.
2. Calculate the total distance the train travels in a day.
3. Divide the total distance by the distance traveled per trip to find the number of round trips.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
