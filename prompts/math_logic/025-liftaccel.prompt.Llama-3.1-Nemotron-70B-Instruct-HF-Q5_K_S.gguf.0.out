Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

I'll attempt to answer all three questions, showing my steps. Buckle up!

**Given Constants:**

* Building height: 40 stories
* Story height: 5 meters/story
* Total building height: 40 stories * 5 meters/story = **200 meters**
* Lift's acceleration (a) and deceleration: 1 m/s^2
* Lift's maximum speed (v_max): 5 m/s

**Question 1: Time to reach top floor (40/F) from ground floor (1/F)**

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
	* Initial velocity (v0) = 0 m/s (starts from rest)
	* Final velocity (v) = v_max = 5 m/s
	* Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s^2
	* Use equation: v = v0 + at (to find time to reach max speed)
	* 5 m/s = 0 m/s + (1 m/s^2)t
	* t_acceleration = 5 seconds to reach max speed
2. **Cruising Phase (at max speed):**
	* Distance covered during acceleration: 
		+ Use equation: s = v0t + 0.5at^2 (since v0 = 0, it simplifies to s = 0.5at^2)
		+ s_acceleration = 0.5 * (1 m/s^2) * (5 s)^2 = 12.5 meters
	* Remaining distance to top: 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters
	* Time to cover remaining distance at max speed (5 m/s):
		+ t_cruising = distance / speed = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds
3. **Deceleration Phase:**
	* Since the lift decelerates at the same rate it accelerates, and it needs to come to a complete stop, the time to decelerate is the same as the time to accelerate: **5 seconds**
4. **Total Time:**
	* t_total = t_acceleration + t_cruising + t_deceleration
	* t_total = 5 s + 37.5 s + 5 s = **47.5 seconds**

**Answer to Question 1:** It takes **47.5 seconds** to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Time for two people, one to 10/F and one to 30/F**

* **Person to 10/F (50 meters, since 10 stories * 5 meters/story):**
	1. Acceleration phase remains the same as Question 1: **5 seconds** to reach max speed.
	2. Cruising phase:
		* Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters (as calculated before)
		* Remaining distance: 50 meters - 12.5 meters = 37.5 meters
		* Time to cover at max speed: 37.5 meters / 5 m/s = **7.5 seconds**
	3. Deceleration phase: **5 seconds** (same as acceleration)
	* **Total time to 10/F:** 5 s + 7.5 s + 5 s = **17.5 seconds**
* **Person to 30/F (150 meters, since 30 stories * 5 meters/story):**
	1. Acceleration phase: **5 seconds** (same as before)
	2. Cruising phase:
		* Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
		* Remaining distance: 150 meters - 12.5 meters = 137.5 meters
		* Time to cover at max speed: 137.5 meters / 5 m/s = **27.5 seconds**
	3. Deceleration phase: **5 seconds**
	* **Total time to 30/F:** 5 s + 27.5 s + 5 s = **37.5 seconds**
* **Total time for both, considering the lift doesn't return to the ground floor between stops:**
	+ The lift first goes to 10/F: **17.5 seconds**
	+ Then, it goes from 10/F to 30/F. Since it's already at 50 meters and moving, we only consider the additional distance (100 meters, since 150 meters - 50 meters) at max speed (no acceleration phase needed as it's already at max speed):
		- Time to cover additional 100 meters at 5 m/s: 100 meters / 5 m/s = **20 seconds**
	+ Deceleration at 30/F: **5 seconds**
	* **Total time for both:** 17.5 s + 20 s + 5 s = **42.5 seconds**

**Answer to Question 2:** It takes **42.5 seconds** for the lift to drop off both people.

**Question 3: Minimum time to 40/F with an intermediate stop**

* The minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop would be achieved by minimizing the additional distance the lift travels at less than max speed (i.e., during acceleration and deceleration phases of the intermediate stop). 
* **Optimal Intermediate Floor:** The floor that minimizes additional travel time would be the one closest to the midpoint of the total travel distance but not exactly at the midpoint, as the lift needs to accelerate and decelerate for the intermediate stop. However, given the nature of the question, we'll consider the closest scenario to the midpoint for simplicity, which would be around 20/F (100 meters, as 20 stories * 5 meters/story), understanding that the true optimal might slightly differ due to the acceleration/deceleration phases.
* **Time to 20/F (as calculated similarly to Question 2, but for 100 meters):**
	+ Acceleration: **5 seconds**
	+ Cruising to cover the remaining 87.5 meters (100 meters - 12.5 meters covered during acceleration): 87.5 meters / 5 m/s = **17.5 seconds**
	+ Deceleration: **5 seconds**
	* **Total to 20/F:** 5 s + 17.5 s + 5 s = **27.5 seconds**
* **From 20/F to 40/F (additional 100 meters, similar calculation as the second part of Question 2):**
	+ Cruising at max speed (no acceleration needed): 100 meters / 5 m/s = **20 seconds**
	+ Deceleration at 40/F: **5 seconds**
	* **Total from 20/F to 40/F:** 20 s + 5 s = **25 seconds**
* **Total Minimum Time to 40/F with a Stop:**
	+ Time to intermediate floor (20/F): **27.5 seconds**
	+ Time from 20/F to 40/F: **25 seconds**
	* **Total Minimum Time:** 27.5 s + 25 s = **52.5 seconds**

**Answer to Question 3:** The minimum time for the lift to get to 40/F with a mandatory stop at another floor is **52.5 seconds**. [end of text]
