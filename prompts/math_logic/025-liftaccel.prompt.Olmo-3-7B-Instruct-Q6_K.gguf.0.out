Let's answer each question step by step, showing all reasoning and calculations.

## **Given Data**

- **Number of floors:** 40
- **Height per floor:** 5 meters
- **Total height from ground (1/F) to 40/F:**  
  \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters
- **Lift/elevator acceleration/deceleration:** \( 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \)
- **Maximum speed of lift:** \( 5 \text{ m/s} \)
- **Assume lift starts from rest at ground floor (0 m), and can only move in one direction (upwards).**

---

## **Question 1: Time from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

We need to find the time taken for the elevator to travel 200 meters **up**, considering acceleration and deceleration limits (but since it's a straight trip from bottom to top, we assume it accelerates as much as possible, then possibly cruises at max speed if distance allows, then decelerates if needed at the top — but since it's just going up, and no one is getting off until the top, we can assume it accelerates as much as possible until it reaches max speed, then continues at max speed if possible, then if it needs to stop at the top (which it does), it decelerates to a stop).

But the problem doesn't specify if the top floor requires a stop (i.e., does it need to come to rest at 40/F, or just pass through? Since it's a passenger ride, it should come to rest at the top).

But let's consider the simplest case: **constant acceleration to max speed, then constant max speed, then deceleration to stop at the top.**

But let's first check if the distance can be covered at max speed.

### **Step 1: Find time to reach max speed (5 m/s) from rest with acceleration 1 m/s²**

Using \( v = u + at \):

\( 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \implies t = 5 \) seconds

Distance covered during acceleration:
\( s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0 + 0.5 \times 1 \times 25 = 12.5 \) meters

### **Step 2: After reaching max speed, how much distance remains?**

Total distance to cover: 200 m  
Distance already covered in acceleration phase: 12.5 m  
Remaining distance: \( 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 \) m

At max speed (5 m/s), time to cover 187.5 m:
\( t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5 \) seconds

### **Step 3: Deceleration phase at the top**

To stop at the top (40/F), the elevator must decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s over some distance.

Deceleration is also 1 m/s² (since it's the same magnitude as acceleration).

Time to decelerate:
\( v_f = v_i + a t \rightarrow 0 = 5 + (-1)t \implies t = 5 \) seconds

Distance covered during deceleration:
\( s = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 5 \times 5 + 0.5 \times (-1) \times 25 = 25 - 12.5 = 12.5 \) meters

But we need to stop at 200 m, so the deceleration must happen *at the very end*, i.e., the last 12.5 meters of the journey will be under deceleration from 5 m/s to 0.

However, in practice, the elevator will accelerate for 5 s to reach 5 m/s (covering 12.5 m), then cruise at 5 m/s for the rest, but must decelerate in the final 12.5 m to stop at 200 m.

So the total distance is:

- Acceleration phase: 12.5 m (first 5 s)
- Cruising phase: 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 m at 5 m/s
  - Time cruising: 175 / 5 = 35 s
- Deceleration phase: last 12.5 m, taking 5 s (final 5 s)

Total time = 5 s (accel) + 35 s (cruise) + 5 s (decel) = **45 seconds**

Alternatively, you can use the kinematic equation for the entire journey if you model it as accelerating for half the distance and decelerating for the other half (but since max speed is reached and then used, the above breakdown is more accurate).

But let's confirm using the equation of motion for the whole trip if we assume the elevator starts from rest, accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches max speed, then continues at max speed until it needs to decelerate to stop at the end.

Alternatively, we can use the **total distance under variable acceleration** but it's easier with the stepwise approach.

So the answer is:

\[
\boxed{45 \text{ seconds}}
\]

## **Question 2: Two people get on at ground floor. One goes to 10/F, the other to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Assume both want to ride together as long as possible, but since the elevator can only take one at a time (unless it's a split trip — but the question says "the lift/elevator", so likely only one can go at a time unless they wait for the next trip).

But the question says "how long does it take?" — probably assuming the elevator makes a single trip, stops at 10/F to let one person off, then continues to 30/F to let the other off, then possibly goes to 40/F if desired.

But the question is ambiguous — but let's interpret as: the elevator starts at 1/F, goes up to 10/F (first stop), then continues to 30/F (second stop), then possibly continues to 40/F (if needed). But since both want to go to their respective floors, the elevator must stop at both.

But the question says "how long does it take?" — likely the time from 1/F to 30/F, making stops at 10/F and 30/F.

But let's clarify the route:

- The elevator starts at ground (1/F).
- Stops at 10/F to let the first passenger out.
- Continues upward.
- Stops at 30/F to let the second passenger out.
- Then, presumably, continues to the top (40/F) if needed, but the question doesn't specify where it ends. However, since both have disembarked by 30/F, the ride could end there, or go further.

But the question probably wants the time from 1/F to 30/F with stops at 10/F and 30/F.

Let's compute the total distance and time accordingly.

### **Route: 1/F → 10/F → 30/F**

- From 1/F to 10/F: 9 floors × 5 m = 45 m
- From 10/F to 30/F: (30 - 10) = 20 floors × 5 m = 100 m
  - Total distance: 45 + 100 = 145 m

But the elevator must stop at 10/F (deceleration to stop, then acceleration back up), and at 30/F (deceleration to stop).

Let's break it into phases:

#### **Phase 1: 1/F to 10/F (stop at 10/F)**

- Distance: 45 m
- Starts from rest, accelerates at 1 m/s² until reaches max speed (if possible), then possibly decelerates to stop at 10/F.

Time to reach 45 m with acceleration and deceleration constraints:

First, time to reach max speed (5 m/s) as before: 5 s, covering 12.5 m.

Remaining distance to 10/F: 45 - 12.5 = 32.5 m

At max speed (5 m/s), time to cover 32.5 m: 32.5 / 5 = 6.5 s

But now, the elevator must decelerate to stop at 10/F. From 5
