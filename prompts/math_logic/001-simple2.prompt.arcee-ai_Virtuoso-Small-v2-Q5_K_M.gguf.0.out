Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

1. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

2. It is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120), which means it is the product of all positive integers up to 5.

3. It is the sum of the first 15 positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120).

4. It is the number of permutations of 5 objects (5P5 = 5! = 120).

5. It is the number of minutes in 2 hours (2 × 60 = 120).

6. It is the number of seconds in 2 minutes (2 × 60 = 120).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip and then divide the total time in a day by this value.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time it takes for one way is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since a round trip involves going to the other city and coming back, the total time for one round trip is:

Total time = 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours (approximately)

There are 24 hours in a day, so the number of round trips the train can make within a full day is:

Number of round trips = Total time in a day / Time for one round trip = 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
