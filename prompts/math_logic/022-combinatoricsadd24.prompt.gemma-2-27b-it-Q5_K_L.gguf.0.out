Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

model
```
Attempt: (8 / 4) * (3 * 1) = 2 * 3 = 6, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 / 1) = 5 * 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 / 1) - (4 - 3) * 1 = 8 - 1 * 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 / 3) = 7 * 1.3333 = 9.3333, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) / 1 = 4 * 5 / 1 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 / 3) - 1 = 10.6667 - 1 = 9.6667, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 8) - (3 * 1) = 32 - 3 = 29, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 3) + (8 / 1) = 12 + 8 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
