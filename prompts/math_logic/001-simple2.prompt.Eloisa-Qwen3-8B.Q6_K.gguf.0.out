Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Hmm, I know that 120 is a triangular number, which means it's the sum of the first 15 natural numbers. Let me check that: 1+2+3+...+15. The formula for triangular numbers is n(n+1)/2, so 15*16/2 = 120. Yep, that's right. Also, 120 is a factorial number, 5! = 120. That's another significant property. Oh, and in terms of divisors, 120 has a lot of factors. Let me list them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors, which is quite a few. Also, 120 is the least common multiple of the numbers 1 through 5, since LCM(1,2,3,4,5) is 60, wait no, LCM(1,2,3,4,5) is actually 60, but 120 is LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6). Wait, maybe I should double-check that. LCM of 1-6 is 60? No, LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6) is 60? Wait, 4 and 6 have LCM 12, but 5 is prime, so LCM(12,5)=60. Yes, so 60 is LCM of 1-6. So 120 is LCM of 1-7? Let's see: 7 is prime, so LCM(60,7)=420. So 120 isn't LCM of 1-7. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Another thing: 120 is the number of seconds in 2 minutes, which is a common fact. Also, in some contexts, like in the Bible, 120 is the age when Methuselah died, but that's more of a cultural reference. Also, in mathematics, 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me confirm: 120 has 16 divisors, and numbers below it have fewer. For example, 60 has 12 divisors, 84 has 12, 90 has 12, 96 has 12, 108 has 18? Wait, 108: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,27,36,54,108. That's 12 divisors. Wait, 120 has 16, which is more than 108's 12. So yes, 120 is highly composite. Also, 120 is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 16, which is C(16,2)=120. Interesting. So, summarizing, 120 is a triangular number, a factorial (5!), a highly composite number, has many divisors, and appears in various contexts like time and biblical references.

Moving on to Q2: Solve the equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0. This is a quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula: x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2. Wait, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-7)² - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121. So √D = 11. Therefore, x = [7 ± 11]/2. So two solutions: (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, and (7 - 11)/2 = -4/2 = -2. So the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2. Alternatively, I could factor the equation. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Let's see: 2 and -9: 2*(-9) = -18, 2 + (-9) = -7. Yes, so (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0. So x = -2 or x = 9. Same answer.

Now Q3: A train travels at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips can it make in a day? First, a round trip is going and coming back, so total distance for one round trip is 200 km * 2 = 400 km. Time for one round trip is distance divided by speed: 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 hours = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.6667 hours. Now, a full day is 24 hours. So number of round trips is 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6. But you can't make a fraction of a trip, so it would be 3 full round trips. Wait, but let me check the time. 3 round trips would take 3 * 20/3 = 20 hours. Then there's 4 hours left. Can it make another trip? A one-way trip is 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours. So in 4 hours, it can make one full one-way trip and have 4 - 10/3 = 12/3 - 10/3 = 2/3 hours left, which isn't enough for another trip. So total round trips are 3. But wait, the question says "how many round trips can it make within a full day?" So 3 round trips take 20 hours, and the remaining 4 hours aren't enough for another round trip. So the answer is 3. But let me confirm the calculations. Time for one round trip: 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 hours. 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6. Since it can't do a fraction, it's 3. Alternatively, total distance in a day: 60 km/h * 24 h = 1440 km. Each round trip is 400 km, so 1440 / 400 = 3.6. Again, 3 full round trips. So the answer is 3.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**  
The number 120 has several interesting mathematical and cultural properties:

1. **Triangular Number:**  
   120 is the 15th triangular number, meaning it is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers:  
   $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 15 = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120$.

2. **Factorial Number:**  
   120 is equal to $5!$ (5 factorial):  
   $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.

3. **Highly Composite Number:**  
   120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It has **16 divisors**:  
   $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120$.

4. **Least Common Multiple (LCM):**  
   120 is the LCM of the numbers 1 through 6:  
   $\text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 120$.

5. **Cultural Significance:**  
   - In the Bible, Methuselah lived for **120 years** (Genesis 5:27).  
   - There are **120 seconds** in 2 minutes.  
   - In some traditions, 120 is associated with the number of elders or a symbolic threshold.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**  
To solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
Here, $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = -18$.  

1. **Calculate the discriminant:**  
   $$
   D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   $$  
   $\sqrt{D} = \sqrt{121} = 11$.

2. **Apply the quadratic formula:**  
   $$
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   $$  
   - First solution: $\frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9$  
   - Second solution: $\frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$  

**Final Answer:**  
The solutions are $x = 9$ and $x = -2$.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**  
1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**  
   - Distance for one round trip: $200 \, \text{km} \times 2 = 400 \, \text{km}$.  
   - Time for one round trip: $\frac{400 \, \text{km}}{60 \, \text{km/h}} = \frac{40}{6} \, \text{hours} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours} \approx 6.6667 \, \text{hours}$.  

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**  
   $$
   \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \, \text{hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours/trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   $$  

3. **Interpret the result:**  
   - Since the train cannot complete a fraction of a trip, it can make **3 full round trips**.  
   - Time taken for 3 round trips: $3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20 \, \text{hours}$.  
   - Remaining time: $24 - 20 = 4 \, \text{hours}$.  
   - In 4 hours, the train can travel: $60 \, \text{km/h} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{km}$.  
   - This is enough for one full one-way trip (200 km) but not for a second one-way trip (since $200 \, \text{km} > 240 \, \text{km}$ is false, but the remaining time after one one-way trip would be $4 - \frac{200}{60} = 4 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{hours}$, which is insufficient for a return trip).  

**Final Answer:**  
The train can make **3 round trips** within a full day. [end of text]
