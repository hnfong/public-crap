Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   Input: Three questions (Q1, Q2, Q3).
    *   Task: Provide answers for all questions with steps.
    *   Constraint: If unsure, state "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ...".
    *   Constraint: `/nothink` tag is present at the end of the prompt. This usually indicates a request to bypass the internal thinking process or to provide a direct response without exposing the chain of thought. However, as an AI model, I need to generate the response based on my internal knowledge. The `/nothink` instruction might be a user attempt to trigger a specific mode, but my core functionality involves processing the request. I should answer the questions accurately.
    *   Safety/Policy: No sensitive or harmful content. The questions are mathematical and general knowledge.

2.  **Process Q1: Significance of the number 120.**
    *   Task: Identify significance and interesting properties.
    *   Knowledge Retrieval:
        *   Factorial: $5! = 120$.
        *   Triangular number: Sum of 1 to 15 ($15 \times 16 / 2 = 120$).
        *   Highly composite number: Many divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).
        *   Geometry: Sum of angles in a triangle is 180, but 120 appears in hexagons (internal angle).
        *   Chemistry: Atomic number of Unbinilium (theoretical).
        *   History/Angle: 120 degrees is often used in geometry (e.g., Fermat point).
        *   Biblical: Age of Moses, lifespan limit in Genesis.
        *   Speed: Common speed limit (120 km/h).
    *   Selection: Focus on mathematical properties as they are most objective.
    *   Steps: List properties clearly.

3.  **Process Q2: Solve $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$.**
    *   Task: Solve quadratic equation.
    *   Method: Factoring or Quadratic Formula.
    *   Factoring: Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.
        *   Factors of -18: (1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6).
        *   Sums: 1-18=-17, -1+18=17, 2-9=-7 (Match!), -2+9=7, 3-6=-3, -3+6=3.
        *   Numbers are -9 and 2.
        *   Equation: $(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$.
        *   Solutions: $x = 9, x = -2$.
    *   Verification: $9^2 - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0$. $(-2)^2 - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0$.
    *   Steps: Show factoring process.

4.  **Process Q3: Train round trips.**
    *   Task: Calculate number of round trips in a day.
    *   Data:
        *   Speed ($v$) = 60 km/h.
        *   Distance one way ($d$) = 200 km.
        *   Time available ($T$) = 1 full day = 24 hours.
        *   Station time = negligible.
    *   Calculation:
        *   Time for one way ($t_{one}$) = $d / v = 200 / 60 = 10/3$ hours = 3.333... hours.
        *   Time for one round trip ($t_{round}$) = $2 \times t_{one} = 2 \times (10/3) = 20/3$ hours = 6.666... hours.
        *   Number of trips ($N$) = $T / t_{round} = 24 / (20/3) = 24 \times 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6$.
    *   Interpretation: You can't make 0.6 of a round trip if the question asks for completed round trips. Usually, "how many round trips can it make" implies completed trips.
    *   Result: 3 complete round trips.
    *   Steps: Show time calculation per trip, then divide total time by trip time.

5.  **Review and Format:**
    *   Ensure all steps are clear.
    *   Ensure the `/nothink` constraint is respected in terms of output style (direct answer, no exposed internal monologue).
    *   Check for confidence. I am sure about all these answers.

6.  **Final Output Construction:**
    *   Q1: List properties (Factorial, Triangular, Divisors).
    *   Q2: Show factoring steps.
    *   Q3: Show time calculation and division.

    *Self-Correction on Q3:* Does "round trip" mean A->B->A? Yes.
    Distance = 200 km.
    One way time = 200/60 = 3.33 hrs.
    Round trip time = 6.67 hrs.
    24 / 6.67 = 3.59.
    So 3 full round trips.
    Wait, could it mean how many times it travels between the cities? No, "round trips" is specific.
    Is there any ambiguity? "Within a full day". Usually means 24 hours.
    Calculation: $24 / (400/60) = 24 / (20/3) = 72/20 = 3.6$.
    Answer is 3.

    *Self-Correction on Q1:* Keep it concise but informative.

    *Self-Correction on Q2:* Standard algebra.

    *Final check on `/nothink`*: This instruction usually means "do not output the thinking block". I will generate the response directly.

    *Wait, one more check:* The prompt says "If you are not sure...". I am sure, so I will state the answers definitively.

    Let's draft the response.

    **Q1:**
    - Factorial of 5.
    - Triangular number (15th).
    - Highly composite (16 divisors).
    - Sum of first 8 triangular numbers? No.
    - Sum of cubes? $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$. No.
    - $120 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
    - Biblical significance (Moses).
    - Angle in hexagon.

    **Q2:**
    - $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$
    - $(x-9)(x+2) = 0$
    - $x = 9, -2$

    **Q3:**
    - Distance one way = 200 km.
    - Round trip distance = 400 km.
    - Speed = 60 km/h.
    - Time per round trip = 400/60 = 6.67 hours.
    - Total time = 24 hours.
    - Trips = 24 / 6.67 = 3.6.
    - Complete trips = 3.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**
The solutions are **$x = 9$** and **$x = -2$**.

**Steps:**
1.  **Identify the coefficients:** The equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a=1$, $b=-7$, and $c=-18$.
2.  **Factor the quadratic:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to $c$ (-18) and add up to $b$ (-7).
    *   Factors of -18 include: $(1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6)$.
    *   Checking the sums: $2 + (-9) = -7$.
    *   The numbers are $-9$ and $2$.
3.  **Rewrite the equation:** $(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$.
4.  **Solve for $x$:**
    *   $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$
    *   $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
The train can make **3 complete round trips**.

**Steps:**
1.  **Calculate the distance of one round trip:**
    *   One way distance = 200 km.
    *   Round trip distance = $200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}$.
2.  **Calculate the time taken for one round trip:**
    *   $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$
    *   $\text{Time} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}$.
3.  **Calculate the total available time:**
    *   A full day = 24 hours.
4.  **Divide total time by time per trip:**
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}}$
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6$
5.  **Interpret the result:**
    *   Since the train cannot complete a partial round trip within the count of "round trips made," we take the whole number.
    *   Total complete round trips = 3. [end of text]
