Here are the answers and step-by-step solutions for your questions.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is mathematically significant because it is a **highly composite number**, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It appears frequently in geometry, combinatorics, and history.

**Interesting Properties & Steps to Verify:**

1.  **Factorial Property:**
    *   120 is the factorial of 5 ($5!$).
    *   Calculation: $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
    *   Significance: This represents the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct items.

2.  **Divisors (Highly Composite):**
    *   Let's find the divisors of 120.
    *   Prime factorization: $120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$.
    *   Number of divisors formula: $(3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$.
    *   The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
    *   Significance: Before 120, no number had 16 divisors. This made it useful historically for measurements and currency systems (like the old British system of pounds, shillings, and pence which relied on highly divisible numbers).

3.  **Triangular Number:**
    *   120 is the 15th triangular number.
    *   Formula: $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
    *   Calculation: $\frac{15 \times 16}{2} = \frac{240}{2} = 120$.
    *   Significance: You can arrange 120 objects into an equilateral triangle with 15 rows.

4.  **Hexagonal and Tetrahedral Number:**
    *   It is also the 8th hexagonal number and the 8th tetrahedral number (representing a pyramid with a triangular base).

5.  **Sum of Powers:**
    *   It is the sum of the first four cubes of primes? No, but it is the sum of the first 8 integers multiplied by something?
    *   Actually, a fun property: $120 = 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3$? Let's check: $8 + 64 + 216 \neq 120$.
    *   Correction: $120 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3$?
    *   Check: $1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100$. (Close, but not 120).
    *   However, $120$ is the smallest number to appear six times in Pascal's Triangle.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**
The solutions are **$x = 9$** and **$x = -2$**.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

We can solve this quadratic equation using either **factoring** or the **quadratic formula**. Factoring is usually faster if the numbers are integers.

**Method 1: Factoring**
1.  We need to find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term ($-18$) and add up to give the coefficient of the middle term ($-7$).
    *   Target Product: $-18$
    *   Target Sum: $-7$
2.  List factor pairs of $-18$:
    *   $1$ and $-18$ (Sum: $-17$)
    *   $-1$ and $18$ (Sum: $17$)
    *   $2$ and $-9$ (Sum: $-7$) $\rightarrow$ **This is the correct pair.**
    *   $-2$ and $9$ (Sum: $7$)
    *   $3$ and $-6$ (Sum: $-3$)
3.  Rewrite the equation using these factors:
    $(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0$
4.  Set each factor to zero to solve for $x$:
    *   $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$
    *   $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

**Method 2: Quadratic Formula (Verification)**
Formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
Where $a = 1$, $b = -7$, $c = -18$.

1.  Calculate the discriminant ($\Delta$):
    $\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)$
    $\Delta = 49 - (-72)$
    $\Delta = 49 + 72 = 121$
2.  Calculate $x$:
    $x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2(1)}$
    $x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}$
3.  Find the two cases:
    *   Case 1: $x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9$
    *   Case 2: $x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$

Both methods yield the same result.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
The train can make **3 full round trips** (and be halfway through a fourth).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1.  **Identify the variables:**
    *   Speed ($v$) = $60$ km/h
    *   Distance one way ($d$) = $200$ km
    *   Total time available ($T$) = 1 full day = $24$ hours
    *   Definition of a "round trip": Traveling from City A to City B AND back to City A.

2.  **Calculate the distance of one round trip:**
    *   $\text{Distance}_{\text{round}} = 2 \times d$
    *   $\text{Distance}_{\text{round}} = 2 \times 200 \text{ km} = 400 \text{ km}$

3.  **Calculate the time required for one round trip:**
    *   $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$
    *   $\text{Time}_{\text{round}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}}$
    *   $\text{Time}_{\text{round}} = \frac{40}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}$ (or 6 hours and 40 minutes).

4.  **Calculate the total number of round trips possible in 24 hours:**
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total Time Available}}{\text{Time per round trip}}$
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = \frac{24}{20/3}$
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20}$
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = \frac{72}{20}$
    *   $\text{Number of trips} = 3.6$

5.  **Interpret the result:**
    *   The calculation gives 3.6 trips.
    *   Since the question asks how many *round trips* it can make, we count only the completed trips.
    *   The train completes 3 full round trips.
    *   The remaining 0.6 represents a partial trip (specifically, it would be enough to go one way again, as 0.6 of a round trip is $0.6 \times 400 = 240$ km, which covers the 200km return leg with 40km to spare, but it does not complete the *next* full round trip).

**Conclusion:** The train completes **3** full round trips. [end of text]
