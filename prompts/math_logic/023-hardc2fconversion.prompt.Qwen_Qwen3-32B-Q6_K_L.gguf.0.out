The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is a **mnemonic or memory trick** to help remember a few specific temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit where the digits of the numbers are reversed.

Let me explain this with examples.

---

### 🔁 What does "digits are inverted" mean?

It means that the **digits of the Celsius temperature are the reverse of the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature**.

For example:
- 12°C becomes 54°F → 12 and 54 are **digit reverses**.
- 21°C becomes 69.8°F → 21 and 69.8 are **not exact digit reverses**, but 21 and 69 are close.
- 27°C becomes 80.6°F → 27 and 80.6 are **not digit reverses**.
- 30°C becomes 86°F → 30 and 86 are **not digit reverses**.

So the trick is **not a general rule**, but a **memory aid** for a few specific values where the digits are reversed.

### ✅ Examples where the digits are inverted:

| Celsius (°C) | Fahrenheit (°F) | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| 12°C         | 54°F             | 12 and 54 are digit reverses |
| 21°C         | 69.8°F           | 21 and 69 are digit reverses (approximate) |
| 27°C         | 80.6°F           | 27 and 80 are digit reverses (approximate) |
| 30°C         | 86°F             | 30 and 86 are **not** digit reverses |
| 33°C         | 91.4°F           | 33 and 91 are **not** digit reverses |

### 🧠 How to use this trick:

This is **not a formula**, but a **memory aid** to help you remember a few key conversions.

For example:
- If you remember that **12°C = 54°F**, you can remember that the digits are reversed.
- If you remember that **21°C = 69.8°F**, you can remember that the digits are reversed (21 → 69).

This is useful for **quick mental estimates** or **memorizing common temperatures**.

### 📌 Summary:

- The phrase **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is a **memory trick**, not a rule.
- It refers to specific Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions where the **digits of the numbers are reversed**.
- Examples include:
  - 12°C = 54°F
  - 21°C = 69.8°F
- This is a **mnemonic**, not a general formula for conversion.
