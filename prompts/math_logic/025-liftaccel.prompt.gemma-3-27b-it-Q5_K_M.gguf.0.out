Okay, let's break down these lift problems step-by-step. This is going to involve some physics calculations (kinematics) and a bit of logical thinking.

**Understanding the Problem & Key Formulas**

* **Total Distance:** The building is 40 stories * 5 meters/story = 200 meters tall.
* **Acceleration/Deceleration (a):** 1 m/s²
* **Maximum Speed (v_max):** 5 m/s
* **Kinematic Equations:** We'll use these:
    *  v = u + at  (final velocity = initial velocity + acceleration * time)
    *  s = ut + (1/2)at² (displacement = initial velocity * time + (1/2) * acceleration * time²)
    *  v² = u² + 2as (final velocity² = initial velocity² + 2 * acceleration * displacement)

**Question 1: Ground Floor to Top Floor (40/F)**

This is the most straightforward case. We need to figure out the time spent accelerating, cruising at max speed, and decelerating.

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   * Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s
   * Final velocity (v) = 5 m/s
   * Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   * Time to reach max speed (t₁) = (v - u) / a = (5 - 0) / 1 = 5 seconds
   * Distance covered during acceleration (s₁) = ut + (1/2)at² = 0 * 5 + (1/2) * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters

2. **Cruising Phase:**
   * We need to figure out how much distance is covered at max speed.
   * Total distance = 200 meters
   * Distance covered accelerating and decelerating = 12.5 meters + 12.5 meters = 25 meters (deceleration is symmetrical to acceleration)
   * Distance covered at max speed (s₂) = 200 - 25 = 175 meters
   * Time spent cruising (t₂) = s₂ / v_max = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   * This is symmetrical to the acceleration phase.
   * Time to decelerate (t₃) = 5 seconds
   * Distance covered during deceleration (s₃) = 12.5 meters

4. **Total Time:**
   * Total time (T) = t₁ + t₂ + t₃ = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

**Answer 1: It takes 45 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor.**



**Question 2: Person 1 to 10/F, Person 2 to 30/F**

This is trickier. We need to calculate the time to 10/F, then the time from 10/F to 30/F, and finally the time from 30/F to 40/F.  We'll assume the lift doesn't lose speed between stops.

1. **10/F (10 * 5 = 50 meters):**
   * We need to check if the lift reaches max speed before stopping at 10/F.
   * Using v² = u² + 2as,  5² = 0² + 2 * 1 * 50  => 25 = 100. This is FALSE.
   * The lift does *not* reach max speed before 10/F.  It accelerates constantly.
   * Time to reach 10/F (t₁) = √(2s/a) = √(2 * 50 / 1) = √100 = 10 seconds

2. **10/F to 30/F (20 * 5 = 100 meters):**
   * The lift is already at 5m/s when it leaves 10/F.
   * Check if the lift can reach max speed before stopping at 30/F.
   * Distance to reach max speed from 5m/s: v² = u² + 2as => 5² = 5² + 2 * 1 * s => s = 0. The lift is already at max speed.
   * Distance covered at max speed: 100 meters.
   * Time to reach 30/F (t₂) = 100 / 5 = 20 seconds

3. **30/F to 40/F (10 * 5 = 50 meters):**
   * The lift is already at 5m/s when it leaves 30/F.
   * Using v² = u² + 2as,  5² = 5² + 2 * 1 * 50  => 25 = 100. This is FALSE.
   * The lift does *not* reach max speed before 40/F.  It decelerates constantly.
   * Time to reach 40/F (t₃) = √(2s/a) = √(2 * 50 / 1) = √100 = 10 seconds

4. **Total Time:**
   * Total time (T) = t₁ + t₂ + t₃ = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 seconds

**Answer 2: It takes 40 seconds for both people to reach their destinations.**



**Question 3: Person 1 to 40/F, Person 2 to an intermediate floor**

This is the most complex. We want to *minimize* the total time, given that the lift *must* stop at another floor before reaching 40/F.  The key is to realize that stopping at a floor closer to 40/F will likely be faster.

Let's consider a few scenarios and then generalize:

* **Scenario 1: Stop at 20/F (100 meters)**
    1. **0/F to 20/F (100 meters):**  The lift reaches max speed.
       * Time to reach max speed: 5 seconds
       * Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
       * Distance covered at max speed: 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters
       * Time spent cruising: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds
       * Total time to 20/F: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds
    2. **20/F to 40/F (100 meters):** The lift reaches max speed.
       * Time to reach max speed: 5 seconds
       * Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
       * Distance covered at max speed: 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters
       * Time spent cruising: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds
       * Total time to 40/F: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds
    3. **Total time: 25 + 25 = 50 seconds**

* **Scenario 2: Stop at 39/F (195 meters)**
    1. **0/F to 39/F (195 meters):** The lift reaches max speed.
       * Time to reach max speed: 5 seconds
       * Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
       * Distance covered at max speed: 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170 meters
       * Time spent cruising: 170 / 5 = 34 seconds
       * Total time to 39/F: 5 + 34 + 5 =
