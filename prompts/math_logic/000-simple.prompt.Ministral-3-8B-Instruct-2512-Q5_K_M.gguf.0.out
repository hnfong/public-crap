Here are the answers to your questions:

Q1: 1 + 1 = **2**

Q2: 6 * 7 = **42**

Q3: 83 * 59 = **4900 - 415 + 245 = 4900 - 170 = 4730** (I used the distributive property: 80*59 + 3*59)
   - **Answer: 4917** (Correction: 83 * 59 = 4917)

Q4: 349 * 683 = **I am not sure, but I can break it down using the distributive property:**
   - 300 * 683 = 204,900
   - 40 * 683 = 27,320
   - 9 * 683 = 6,147
   - Sum: 204,900 + 27,320 = 232,220; 232,220 + 6,147 = 238,367
   - **Answer: 238,367**

Q5: 6043 * 7489 = **This is a complex multiplication, but I can use the distributive property again:**
   - Break 7489 into 7000 + 400 + 80 + 9
   - 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000
   - 6043 * 400 = 2,417,200
   - 6043 * 80 = 483,440
   - 6043 * 9 = 54,387
   - Sum: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200
   - 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640
   - 45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027
   - **Answer: 45,256,027**

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22
   - Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
   - Divide both sides by 3: x = 5
   - **Answer: x = 5**

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   - 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
   - **Answer: 20**

Q8: You buy a book for $15 and give the shopkeeper two $20 bills ($40) and an additional $5 bill ($45 total). The book costs $15, so the change should be $45 - $15 = $30.
   - **Answer: $30**

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   - Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units
   - **Answer: 20 units**

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   - Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children
   - **Answer: 4 children**

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
   - Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Division first
   - 12 ÷ 4 = 3
   - Then: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
   - **Answer: 5**

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   - 20% of $25 = 0.20 * 25 = $5
   - Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20
   - **Answer: $20**

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   - From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes.

   - **Answer: 165 minutes**

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   - 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5, so you need 6 taxis (since you can't have half a taxi)
   - **Answer: 6 taxis**

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   - Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees
   - **Answer: 87 degrees** [end of text]
