Alright, I need to construct a mathematical expression using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 to get the result of 24. Let's start by considering different operations and combinations of these numbers.

First, I'll try simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Maybe I can use parentheses to change the order of operations.

Attempt 1: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying.

Hmm, that didn't work. Let's see, maybe I can rearrange the numbers or use different operations.

Attempt 2: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 = 24, then 24 + 4 = 28, and 28 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying.

Okay, that's close but not quite there. Maybe I need to adjust the operations.

Attempt 3: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * 5 = 20, then 20 + 4 = 24. That works! But wait, I used the number 4 twice, which might not be allowed if each number has to be used exactly once.

Attempt 4: 4 * 8 - 3 - 1 = 32 - 3 - 1 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 5: (8 / 4) * (3 + 1) = 2 * 4 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 6: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 7: (8 - 1) * (4 + 3) = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 8: 8 * 3 + (4 - 1) = 24 + 3 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 9: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 10: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 8 * 3 + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying.

Attempt 11: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. That works! And I used each number exactly once: 8, 4, 3, and 1.

Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, and 12 * 2 = 24. Perfect!
