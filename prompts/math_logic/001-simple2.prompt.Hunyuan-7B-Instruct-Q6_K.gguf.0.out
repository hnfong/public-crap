### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is a highly significant number in mathematics, known as a **factorial of 5** (denoted as $5!$), since $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$. It is also a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Here are some of its interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: $120 = 5!$.
2. **Divisors**: The divisors of 120 are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120$. It has 16 divisors, which is more than any smaller number.
3. **Perfect Number**: $120$ is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) equals the number itself:
   $$
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 120
$$
4. **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: $120$ is the least common multiple of the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60$.
5. **Triangular Number**: $120$ is also a triangular number, meaning it can form an equilateral triangle with 120 small equilateral triangles of side length 1.
6. **Catalan Number**: $120$ is the 5th Catalan number, which is given by the formula:
   $$
   C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
$$
   For $n = 5$, $C_5 = 42$, but $120$ is related to other combinatorial properties.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = -18$. We can solve it using the **quadratic formula**:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)}
$$

Simplify:

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}
$$

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

Now calculate the two possible solutions:

1. $x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9$
2. $x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$

Thus, the solutions are:

$$
x = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
$$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. **Calculate the time for one trip**:
   The time $t$ is given by the formula:
   $$
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}
$$
   Substituting the values:
   $$
   t = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \, \text{hours}
$$

2. **Calculate the time for one round trip**:
   A round trip means the train travels to the city and back, so the total distance is $2 \times 200 = 400 \, \text{km}$.
   The time for one round trip is:
   $$
   t_{\text{round trip}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours}
$$

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours**:
   The number of round trips $n$ is given by:
   $$
   n = \frac{\text{total time in a day}}{\text{time for one round trip}}
$$
   Substituting the values:
   $$
   n = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, the train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

### Final Answers:
- **Q1**: The number 120 is significant as a factorial, perfect number, and triangular number. It has 16 divisors and is the least common multiple of many numbers.
- **Q2**: The solutions are $x = 9$ and $x = -2$.
- **Q3**: The train can make **3 round trips** in a day.
