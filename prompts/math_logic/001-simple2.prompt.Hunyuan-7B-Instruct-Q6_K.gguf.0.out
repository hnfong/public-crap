### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

#### Significance of 120:
1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, written as $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$. This makes it a highly composite number.
2. **Circumference of a Sphere**: 120 cm is approximately the circumference of a sphere with a radius of 10 cm ($C = 2\pi r$).
3. **Number of Days in a Month**: 120 days is approximately the number of days in a 4-month period.
4. **Astronomy**: 120 degrees is a common angle used in astronomy and trigonometry.
5. **Time in Minutes**: 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours.

#### Interesting Properties of 120:
1. **Divisors**: The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. It is a highly composite number.
2. **Perfect Number**: 120 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) equals the number itself: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 120$.
3. **Multiples**: 120 is a multiple of many numbers, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
4. **Largest Cube Divisor**: The largest cube divisor of 120 is 8 ($2^3$).

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

#### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Quadratic Formula**: The general solution for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is:
   $$
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
   Here, $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = -18$.

2. **Substitute Values**:
   $$
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)}
$$

3. **Simplify**:
   $$
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}
$$
   $$
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$
   $$
   x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

4. **Solve for $x$**:
   - For the positive root:
     $$
     x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
$$
   - For the negative root:
     $$
     x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
$$

#### Final Answer:
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

#### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Time for One Trip**:
   The time taken to travel between the two cities is:
   $$
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \, \text{hours}
$$

2. **Time for One Round Trip**:
   A round trip involves traveling to the city and back, so the total distance is:
   $$
   \text{Total Distance} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \, \text{km}
$$
   The time for one round trip is:
   $$
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours}
$$

3. **Number of Round Trips in 24 Hours**:
   The number of round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours) is:
   $$
   \text{Number of Round Trips} = \frac{\text{Total Time in a Day}}{\text{Time for One Round Trip}} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

4. **Final Answer**:
   Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, the train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

#### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3}
$$
