 The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to a simple rule for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. This rule states that for every 12 degrees Celsius increase or decrease, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will have its digits reversed.

To understand this rule, let's first look at the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit:

Fahrenheit (°F) = (Celsius (°C) × 9/5) + 32

Now, let's apply the rule and see how it works with some examples:

Example 1:
Celsius: 0°C
Fahrenheit: (0 × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F

Example 2:
Celsius: 12°C
Fahrenheit: (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 53.6°F

According to the rule, the digits in the Fahrenheit temperature should be inverted. However, in this case, the rule doesn't apply because the Fahrenheit temperature doesn't have its digits reversed.

Example 3:
Celsius: 24°C
Fahrenheit: (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 75.2°F

In this case, the rule applies. The digits in the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted compared to the Celsius temperature:

Celsius: 24°C
Fahrenheit: 75.2°F

Inverted: 42°C

Example 4:
Celsius: 36°C
Fahrenheit: (36 × 9/5) + 32 = 96.8°F

In this case, the rule doesn't apply because the Fahrenheit temperature doesn't have its digits reversed.

In conclusion, the phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is not a reliable rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. Instead, it's essential to use the correct formula:

Fahrenheit (°F) = (Celsius (°C) × 9/5) + 32

This formula will give you accurate conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. [end of text]
