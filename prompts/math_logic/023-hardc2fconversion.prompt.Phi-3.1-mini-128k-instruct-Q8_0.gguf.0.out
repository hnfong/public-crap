"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to a simple rule for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. This rule is based on the fact that the freezing point of water is 0°C, which is equivalent to 32°F, and the boiling point of water is 100°C, which is equivalent to 212°F. The difference between these two points is 100°C or 180°F, which means that for every 1°C increase in temperature, the Fahrenheit temperature increases by 1.8°F (since 180°F / 100°C = 1.8°F/°C).

However, the phrase you've provided seems to be a misinterpretation of the actual conversion formula. The correct formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Using this formula, let's look at some examples to illustrate the conversion:

1. Converting 0°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (0 × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F

2. Converting 10°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (10 × 9/5) + 32 = 50°F

3. Converting 20°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (20 × 9/5) + 32 = 68°F

4. Converting 30°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (30 × 9/5) + 32 = 86°F

5. Converting 40°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (40 × 9/5) + 32 = 104°F

6. Converting 50°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (50 × 9/5) + 32 = 122°F

7. Converting 60°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (60 × 9/5) + 32 = 140°F

8. Converting 70°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (70 × 9/5) + 32 = 158°F

9. Converting 80°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (80 × 9/5) + 32 = 176°F

10. Converting 90°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (90 × 9/5) + 32 = 194°F

11. Converting 100°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (100 × 9/5) + 32 = 212°F

As you can see, the Fahrenheit temperatures increase by 1.8°F for every 1°C increase in Celsius, not by inverting the digits. The phrase you provided does not accurately describe the conversion process. It's possible that the phrase was meant to refer to a different concept or rule, but as it stands, it's not correct for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

If you're looking for a simpler rule that might be easier to remember, you could consider the fact that the Fahrenheit scale has 180 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water, while the Celsius scale has 100 degrees. This means that for every 1°C increase, the Fahrenheit temperature increases by 1.8°F (since 180°F / 100°C = 1.8°F/°C). However, this is not a rule that involves inverting digits.<|im_end|>
