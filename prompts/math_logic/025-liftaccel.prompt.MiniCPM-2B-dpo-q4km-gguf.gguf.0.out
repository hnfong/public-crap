There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

<AI> 1. To find the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

The distance is the height of the building, which is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

The speed of the lift is 5 m/s, but since the acceleration is 1 m/s^2, the actual speed is 5 m/s - 1 m/s^2 = 4 m/s.

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

Time = 200 meters / 4 m/s = 50 seconds

So, it takes 50 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. To find the time it takes for two people to get from the ground floor to their respective floors, we need to consider the time it takes for each person to get to their floor and the time it takes for the lift to return to the ground floor.

First person goes to floor 10, which is 3 floors below the top floor. It takes 3 floors * 5 meters/floor = 15 meters to reach floor 10. The time it takes for the first person to reach floor 10 is 15 meters / 4 m/s = 3.75 seconds.

Next, the first person gets off the lift and walks to floor 10. The time it takes for the first person to walk to floor 10 is 10 meters / 1 m/s = 10 seconds.

Now, the first person is at floor 10. The second person goes to floor 30, which is 20 floors below the top floor. It takes 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters to reach floor 30. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 30 is 100 meters / 4 m/s = 25 seconds.

Next, the second person gets off the lift and walks to floor 30. The time it takes for the second person to walk to floor 30 is 30 meters / 1 m/s = 30 seconds.

Now, the first person is at floor 10, and the second person is at floor 30. The total time for both people to reach their floors is 3.75 seconds + 10 seconds + 25 seconds + 30 seconds = 73.75 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to return to the ground floor. The lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 25. It takes 25 floors * 5 meters/floor = 125 meters to reach floor 25. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 25 is 125 meters / 4 m/s = 31.25 seconds.

Now, the total time for both people to reach their floors and for the lift to return to the ground floor is 73.75 seconds + 31.25 seconds = 105 seconds.

So, it takes 105 seconds for two people to get from the ground floor to their respective floors.

3. To find the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to stop at each floor.

Let's assume the first person goes to floor 20. It takes 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters to reach floor 20. The time it takes for the first person to reach floor 20 is 100 meters / 4 m/s = 25 seconds.

Now, the first person is at floor 20, and the second person is at floor 1/F. The total time for both people to reach their floors is 25 seconds + 30 seconds = 55 seconds.

Next, the first person gets off the lift and walks to floor 20. The time it takes for the first person to walk to floor 20 is 20 meters / 1 m/s = 20 seconds.

Now, the first person is at floor 20, and the second person is at floor 25. The total time for both people to reach their floors is 25 seconds + 30 seconds + 31.25 seconds = 86.25 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to return to the ground floor. The lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 25. It takes 25 floors * 5 meters/floor = 125 meters to reach floor 25. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 25 is 125 meters / 4 m/s = 31.25 seconds.

Now, the total time for both people to reach their floors and for the lift to return to the ground floor is 86.25 seconds + 31.25 seconds = 117.5 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 1/F. It takes 1 floor * 5 meters/floor = 5 meters to reach floor 1/F. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 1/F is 5 meters / 4 m/s = 1.25 seconds.

Now, the total time for both people to reach their floors and for the lift to return to the ground floor is 117.5 seconds + 1.25 seconds = 118.75 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 20. It takes 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters to reach floor 20. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 20 is 100 meters / 4 m/s = 25 seconds.

Now, the total time for both people to reach their floors and for the lift to return to the ground floor is 118.75 seconds + 25 seconds = 143.75 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 25. It takes 25 floors * 5 meters/floor = 125 meters to reach floor 25. The time it takes for the second person to reach floor 25 is 125 meters / 4 m/s = 31.25 seconds.

Now, the total time for both people to reach their floors and for the lift to return to the ground floor is 143.75 seconds + 31.25 seconds = 175 seconds.

However, we need to consider the time it takes for the lift to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume the second person goes to floor 1/F. It takes 1 floor * 5 meters/floor = 5 meters to reach
