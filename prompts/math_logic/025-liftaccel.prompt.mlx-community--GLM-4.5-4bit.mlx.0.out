### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

**Given:**
- Number of floors: 40 (from 1/F to 40/F)
- Height per floor: 5 meters
- Total height to travel: (40 - 1) * 5 = 39 * 5 = 195 meters
- Acceleration/deceleration: 1 m/s²
- Maximum speed: 5 m/s

**Steps:**

1. **Determine the time to reach maximum speed:**
   - Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Maximum speed (v_max) = 5 m/s
   - Time to reach v_max (t_acc) = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during acceleration (s_acc) = 0.5 * a * t_acc² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

2. **Determine the time to decelerate from maximum speed to 0:**
   - Deceleration is the same as acceleration in magnitude but opposite in direction.
   - Time to decelerate (t_dec) = t_acc = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during deceleration (s_dec) = s_acc = 12.5 meters

3. **Check if the elevator reaches maximum speed:**
   - Total distance to travel: 195 meters
   - Distance covered during acceleration and deceleration: s_acc + s_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters
   - Since 25 < 195, the elevator will reach maximum speed and travel at constant speed for some time.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled at constant speed:**
   - Distance at constant speed (s_const) = Total distance - s_acc - s_dec = 195 - 25 = 170 meters
   - Time at constant speed (t_const) = s_const / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds

5. **Total time:**
   - Total time (T) = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds

**Answer to Question 1:**
It takes **44 seconds** to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Given:**
- First person's destination: 10/F
  - Height to 10/F: (10 - 1) * 5 = 9 * 5 = 45 meters
- Second person's destination: 30/F
  - Height to 30/F: (30 - 1) * 5 = 29 * 5 = 145 meters
- The elevator will stop at 10/F first, then proceed to 30/F.

**Steps:**

1. **Travel to 10/F (45 meters):**
   - Check if the elevator reaches maximum speed:
     - s_acc + s_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters
     - 25 < 45, so it reaches maximum speed.
   - Distance at constant speed: 45 - 25 = 20 meters
   - Time at constant speed: 20 / 5 = 4 seconds
   - Time to 10/F: t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 seconds
   - Assume the elevator stops for some time at 10/F. Let's say the stop time is negligible (unless specified otherwise).

2. **Travel from 10/F to 30/F (145 - 45 = 100 meters):**
   - The elevator starts from rest at 10/F and accelerates again.
   - Check if it reaches maximum speed:
     - s_acc + s_dec = 25 meters
     - 25 < 100, so it reaches maximum speed.
   - Distance at constant speed: 100 - 25 = 75 meters
   - Time at constant speed: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds
   - Time from 10/F to 30/F: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds

3. **Total time:**
   - Time to 10/F: 14 seconds
   - Time from 10/F to 30/F: 25 seconds
   - Total time: 14 + 25 = 39 seconds

**Answer to Question 2:**
It takes **39 seconds** for the first person to reach 10/F and the second person to reach 30/F.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Given:**
- First person's destination: 40/F (195 meters)
- Second person's destination: Some floor between 1/F and 40/F (not 40/F)
- The elevator must stop at one intermediate floor to drop off the second person.
- We need to find the minimum time to reach 40/F, which implies choosing the intermediate floor that minimizes the total time.

**Approach:**
To minimize the total time, the intermediate stop should be as close as possible to 40/F, because:
- The elevator will have to decelerate and accelerate again at the intermediate stop, which adds time.
- The closer the stop is to 40/F, the less time is wasted in the acceleration/deceleration phases for the second leg of the journey.

Let's assume the second person gets off at 39/F (the highest possible floor below 40/F).

**Steps:**

1. **Travel to 39/F (height = (39 - 1) * 5 = 190 meters):**
   - Check if the elevator reaches maximum speed:
     - s_acc + s_dec = 25 meters
     - 25 < 190, so it reaches maximum speed.
   - Distance at constant speed: 190 - 25 = 165 meters
   - Time at constant speed: 165 / 5 = 33 seconds
   - Time to 39/F: 5 + 33 + 5 = 43 seconds
   - Stop at 39/F (assume negligible stop time).

2. **Travel from 39/F to 40/F (height = 5 meters):**
   - The elevator starts from rest at 39/F and accelerates to 40/F.
   - Check if it reaches maximum speed:
     - Distance to travel: 5 meters
     - s_acc = 0.5 * 1 * t²
     - To reach v_max = 5 m/s, time needed is 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters.
     - But we only have 5 meters, so it does not reach maximum speed.
   - Time to cover 5 meters with a = 1 m/s²:
     - s = 0.5 * a * t² => 5 = 0.5 * 1 * t² => t² = 10 => t = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16 seconds
   - Since it's accelerating for the entire 5 meters, the time is sqrt(10) seconds.
   - No deceleration is needed because it's stopping at 40/F (assuming it stops abruptly, but in reality, it would need to decelerate, but since the distance is small, we can assume it's negligible or that the elevator is programmed to stop precisely at 40/F without overshooting).

   However, more accurately, the elevator would accelerate for half the distance and decelerate for the other half to stop at 40/F:
   - Distance to accelerate: 2.5 meters
   - Time to accelerate: s = 0.5 * a * t² => 2.5 = 0.5 * 1 * t² => t² = 5 => t = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236 seconds
   - Similarly, time to decelerate: sqrt(5) seconds
   - Total time for 5 meters: 2 * sqrt(5) ≈ 4.472 seconds

   But since the distance is small, the first approximation (sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16 seconds) is also reasonable if we assume the elevator doesn't decelerate (i.e., it's a very short stop). For minimum time, we can assume the elevator doesn't fully stop but just slows down slightly, but the problem states it has to stop, so we'll take the more accurate 4.472 seconds.

3. **Total time:**
   - Time to 39/F: 43 seconds
   - Time from 39/F to 40/F: ~4.472 seconds
   - Total time: 43 + 4.472 ≈ 47.472 seconds

But is stopping at 39/F the optimal choice? Let's check stopping at 38/F to see if it gives a better (smaller) total time.

**Alternative: Stop at 38/F (height = (38 - 1) * 5 = 185 meters):**

1. **Travel to 38/F (185 meters):**
   - s_acc + s_dec = 25 meters
   - Distance at constant speed:
