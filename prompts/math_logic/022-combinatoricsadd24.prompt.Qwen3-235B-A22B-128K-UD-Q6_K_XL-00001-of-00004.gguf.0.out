Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
Attempt: 3 * 8 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 3 * 8 = 24, 24 + 4 = 28, 28 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: 4 + 8 = 12, 3 - 1 = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. ✅ Correct!
```

**Final Answer:**  
$$
(4 + 8) \times (3 - 1) = 24
$$  
Used numbers: 4, 8, 3, 1 — all numbers used exactly once. ✅ [end of text]
