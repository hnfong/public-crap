**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**

The number **120** is a highly interesting and significant number in mathematics and other contexts. Here are some of its notable properties and significances:

### Step 1: Factorial Number
- **120 = 5! (5 factorial)**
  - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
  - This makes 120 the **fifth factorial number**.
  - Factorials are important in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.

### Step 2: Triangular Number
- 120 is a **triangular number**.
  - A triangular number is the sum of the first *n* natural numbers.
  - 120 = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15
  - Formula: Tₙ = n(n+1)/2 → T₁₅ = 15×16/2 = 120

### Step 3: Highly Composite and Abundant
- **Divisors of 120**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 → **16 divisors**
  - This makes 120 a **highly composite number** (though not in the strictest list, it has many divisors for its size).
- **Sum of proper divisors**: 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 240
  - Since 240 > 120, 120 is an **abundant number**.

### Step 4: Tetrahedral Number
- 120 is a **tetrahedral number** (sum of first *n* triangular numbers).
  - It is the 8th tetrahedral number: sum of first 8 triangular numbers.
  - Formula: Tₙ = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 → T₈ = 8×9×10/6 = 720/6 = 120

### Step 5: Practical Number
- 120 is a **practical number**, meaning all smaller positive integers can be expressed as sums of its distinct divisors.

### Step 6: Cultural and Real-World Significance
- **Age**: In some religious texts (e.g., Genesis in the Bible), 120 is associated with the "years of life" (e.g., "Man shall not live more than 120 years").
- **Temperature**: 120°F is a dangerously high body temperature.
- **Electricity**: In the US, standard household voltage is around 120V.
- **Time**: 120 minutes = 2 hours.

**Conclusion**: 120 is mathematically rich — it is a factorial, triangular, tetrahedral, and abundant number with many divisors, making it useful in combinatorics and number theory.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Answer:**

We are given a quadratic equation:

> x² - 7x - 18 = 0

We will solve it using **factoring**.

### Step 1: Identify coefficients
- a = 1, b = -7, c = -18

### Step 2: Find two numbers that:
- Multiply to **a×c = 1×(-18) = -18**
- Add to **b = -7**

Let’s list factor pairs of -18:
- (1, -18) → sum = -17
- (-1, 18) → sum = 17
- (2, -9) → sum = -7 ✅
- (-2, 9) → sum = 7
- (3, -6) → sum = -3
- (-3, 6) → sum = 3

The pair **(2, -9)** works: 2 × (-9) = -18 and 2 + (-9) = -7

### Step 3: Factor the quadratic
Split the middle term:

> x² - 9x + 2x - 18 = 0

Group:
> (x² - 9x) + (2x - 18) = 0  
> x(x - 9) + 2(x - 9) = 0  
> (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0

### Step 4: Solve for x
Set each factor to zero:
- x + 2 = 0 → x = -2
- x - 9 = 0 → x = 9

### ✅ Final Answer:
> **x = -2 or x = 9**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Answer:**

We need to calculate how many **round trips** the train can make in **24 hours**.

### Step 1: Distance for one round trip
- One way = 200 km
- Round trip = 200 × 2 = **400 km**

### Step 2: Time for one round trip
- Speed = 60 km/h
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time for one round trip = 400 km / 60 km/h = **6.666... hours** = **6 hours 40 minutes**

As a fraction:  
400 / 60 = 40 / 6 = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.6667 hours

### Step 3: Total time available
- 1 full day = 24 hours

### Step 4: Number of round trips
- Number = Total time / Time per round trip
- = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × (3/20) = 72 / 20 = **3.6**

This means the train can complete **3 full round trips**, and part of a fourth.

But the question asks: **how many round trips can it make?**

Since a **round trip** is a complete journey (to and from), we can only count **complete** ones.

So, **3 full round trips**.

Let’s verify:

- 1 round trip: 6.666... h
- 3 round trips: 3 × 20/3 = 20 hours
- Remaining time: 24 - 20 = 4 hours

In 4 hours, the train can travel: 60 km/h × 4 h = 240 km

But one way is 200 km, so it can go to the other city (200 km in ~3h20m), but cannot return (needs another 200 km, but only 40 km worth of time left). So it **cannot complete** a 4th round trip.

### ✅ Final Answer:
> **3 round trips**
