Answer: **I am not sure, but I think the answer is 6.**

**Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?**

Answer: **165 minutes**
*(From 3:45 to 4:45 is 60 mins. From 4:45 to 5:45 is 60 mins. From 5:45 to 6:30 is 45 mins. Total: 60+60+45 = 165.)*

**Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?**
