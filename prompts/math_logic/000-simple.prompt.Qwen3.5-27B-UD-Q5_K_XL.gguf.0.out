Here are the answers to your questions:

**Q1:** 1 + 1 = **2**

**Q2:** 6 * 7 = **42**

**Q3:** 83 * 59 = **4,897**
*(Calculation: 83 * 60 = 4980; 4980 - 83 = 4897)*

**Q4:** 349 * 683 = **238,367**
*(Calculation: 349 * 600 = 209,400; 349 * 80 = 27,920; 349 * 3 = 1,047; Sum = 238,367)*

**Q5:** 6043 * 7489 = **45,256,027**
*(Calculation: 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000; 6043 * 400 = 2,417,200; 6043 * 80 = 483,440; 6043 * 9 = 54,387; Sum = 45,256,027)*

**Q6:** To solve $3x + 7 = 22$:
Subtract 7 from both sides: $3x = 15$
Divide by 3: $x = 5$
**Answer: x = 5**

**Q7:** 25% of 80 is **20**.
*(Calculation: 0.25 * 80 = 20)*

**Q8:**
*   Cost of book: $15
*   Money given: Two $20 bills ($40) + One $5 bill ($5) = $45 total.
*   Change needed: $45 - $15 = $30.
**Answer: $30**

**Q9:** Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length.
4 * 5 = **20 units**.

**Q10:** Katherine has 2 brothers and 1 sister. Including Katherine herself, the total number of children is 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 children**.

**Q11:** Evaluate $3 + 12 \div 4 - 1$:
1.  Division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$
2.  Expression becomes: $3 + 3 - 1$
3.  Addition/Subtraction left to right: $6 - 1 = 5$
**Answer: 5**

**Q12:** This question depends on assumptions not provided (e.g., how many slices per person, if Tom eats cake, how many slices are in the cake). However, a common assumption in such riddles is 1 slice per person.
*   Tom + 5 guests = 6 people.
*   If 1 slice per person: **6 slices**.

**Q13:**
*   Original price: $25
*   Discount: 20% of $25 = $5
*   Sale price: $25 - $5 = **$20**

**Q14:**
*   From 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM = 15 minutes
*   From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM = 2 hours (120 minutes)
*   From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM = 30 minutes
*   Total: 15 + 120 + 30 = **165 minutes**.

**Q15:**
*   Total people: 22
*   Capacity per taxi: 4
*   $22 \div 4 = 5.5$
*   Since you cannot have half a taxi, you need to round up to the next whole number.
**Answer: 6 taxis**

**Q16:** The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
*   $180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87$
**Answer: 87 degrees** [end of text]
