Okay, so I have these 16 questions to answer. Let me go through each one step by step. I'll take my time to think through each problem, even if some seem simple, just to make sure I get them right.

Starting with Q1: 1+1=? That's straightforward. I know that 1 plus 1 equals 2. No doubts there.

Q2: 6*7=? Hmm, 6 times 7. Let me recall my multiplication table. 6*7 is 42. Yeah, that's correct.

Q3: 83*59=? Okay, this is a bit trickier. Let me break it down. 80*60 is 4800, but since it's 83 and 59, I need to adjust. Maybe I can compute 83*60 first, which is 4980, and then subtract 83 because 59 is one less than 60. So 4980 - 83 is 4897. I think that's right.

Q4: 349*683=? Wow, that's a big multiplication. I might need to do this step by step. Let me write it out mentally. 349 times 600 is 209,400. Then 349 times 80 is 27,920. Next, 349 times 3 is 1,047. Adding those together: 209,400 + 27,920 is 237,320, plus 1,047 gives 238,367. I'm pretty confident about that.

Q5: 6043*7489=? That's a huge number. I might use the distributive property here. Let me break 7489 into 7000 + 400 + 80 + 9. So, 6043*7000 is 42,301,000. 6043*400 is 2,417,200. 6043*80 is 483,440. 6043*9 is 54,387. Adding them all up: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 is 44,718,200. Then +483,440 makes 45,201,640, and +54,387 gives 45,256,027. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit unsure because it's such a big number.

Q6: Solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22. Okay, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide by 3: x = 5. That seems right.

Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% is a quarter, so a quarter of 80 is 20. Alternatively, 0.25*80=20. Correct.

Q8: I buy a book for $15, give two $20 bills, which is $40. But she doesn't have exact change, so I give an extra $5. So total given is $45. The book costs $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but I gave an extra $5, so does that mean she keeps the $5? Or is the change $30? I think it's $30 because the extra $5 is part of the total given, so the change is $30.

Q9: Perimeter of a square with side 5 units. Perimeter is 4*side, so 4*5=20 units. Easy.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. So including herself, that's 1 (Katherine) + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. So her mother has 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first. 12 รท4=3. So 3 +3 -1=5. That's the answer.

Q12: Tom has 5 guests. How many cake slices? Well, usually, each person gets one slice, so 5 slices. Unless specified otherwise, I think it's 5.

Q13: Shirt costs $25, 20% off. 20% of 25 is 5, so sale price is $20. Alternatively, 25*0.8=20. Correct.

Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM. How many minutes until 6:30 PM? From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But since it's until 6:30, subtract 15 minutes, so 165 minutes. Let me check: from 3:45 to 4:45 is 60, to 5:45 another 60, to 6:45 another 60, total 180. But we need until 6:30, which is 15 minutes less, so 180-15=165. Yes.

Q15: A taxi carries 4 passengers. 22 people. So 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, but you can't have half a taxi, so you need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis carry 20, leaving 2 people, so a 6th taxi is needed.

Q16: Triangle with angles 31 and 62 degrees. Sum of angles in a triangle is 180. So 31 +62=93. 180-93=87 degrees. So the third angle is 87 degrees. That makes sense.
