"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

What a clever trick!

This phrase means that when you convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can easily do so by simply inverting the digits of every 12°C interval. Here's how it works:

* 0°C is 32°F (easy, no inversion needed!)
* 12°C is 54°F (inverted digits: 21°C becomes 72°F)
* 24°C is 75°F (inverted digits: 36°C becomes 96°F)
* 36°C is 98.8°F (inverted digits: 54°C becomes 86°F)

Notice the pattern? Every 12°C, you invert the digits, and the conversion is relatively easy.

Let's try a few more examples:

* 48°C is 118.4°F (inverted digits: 63°C becomes 176.4°F)
* 60°C is 140°F (inverted digits: 90°C becomes 210°F)

Keep in mind that this trick only works for whole numbers (no decimal points) and is an approximation, as the actual Fahrenheit conversion is a precise calculation. However, for rough estimates or mental math, this trick can be a helpful shortcut!
