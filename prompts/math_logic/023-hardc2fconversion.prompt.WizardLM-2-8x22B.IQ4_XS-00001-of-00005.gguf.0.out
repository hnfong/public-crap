 The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to a quick method to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit without doing complex calculations. This is a rough approximation and not an exact conversion, but it can be useful for quick estimations.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with the temperature in Celsius.
2. Multiply the Celsius temperature by 2 to get a rough Fahrenheit equivalent.
3. Add 30 to the result to get a bit closer to the actual Fahrenheit temperature.
4. For every 12°C, you can invert the last two digits of the Fahrenheit temperature to get another approximate value.

Let's illustrate this with some examples:

**Example 1: 0°C to Fahrenheit**
- Multiply by 2: 0 * 2 = 0
- Add 30: 0 + 30 = 30°F (Exact conversion is 32°F)

**Example 2: 12°C to Fahrenheit**
- Multiply by 2: 12 * 2 = 24
- Add 30: 24 + 30 = 54°F (Exact conversion is 53.6°F)
- Invert the last two digits: 54 → 45 (This is not part of the conversion, just an illustration of the "every 12°C" part of the statement.)

**Example 3: 24°C to Fahrenheit**
- Multiply by 2: 24 * 2 = 48
- Add 30: 48 + 30 = 78°F (Exact conversion is 75.2°F)
- Invert the last two digits: 78 → 87 (Again, this is just an illustration of the "every 12°C" part of the statement.)

As you can see, the approximation gets you in the ballpark of the correct Fahrenheit temperature, but it's not precise. The actual formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

°F = (°C * 9/5) + 32

Using this formula, you would get the exact conversion for the examples above:

- 0°C: (0 * 9/5) + 32 = 32°F
- 12°C: (12 * 9/5) + 32 = 53.6°F
- 24°C: (24 * 9/5) + 32 = 75.2°F

The "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" part of the statement seems to be a mnemonic device rather than a mathematical rule. It suggests that as you increase the temperature by 12°C increments, the Fahrenheit temperature will have a pattern where the last two digits change in a predictable way. However, this is not a standard conversion method and should be taken with a grain of salt. It might help you remember the general direction of the conversion but is not a substitute for the actual conversion formula. [end of text]
