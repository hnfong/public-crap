Here are the answers to the questions with steps:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting properties:

* It is a highly composite number, meaning it has many factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120).
* It is a triangular number, which means it can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = 120.
* It is a highly divisible number, meaning it can be divided evenly by many numbers.
* In some cultures, 120 is considered a sacred number, representing completeness or perfection.
* In mathematics, 120 is used in various formulas and equations, such as the formula for the area of a triangle (A = 0.5 * base * height) and the formula for the volume of a cube (V = s^3, where s is the side length).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve the equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

There are two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for the train to make one round trip, and then divide that by the number of hours in a day.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for the train to travel from one city to the other:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since the train travels from one city to the other and back, the total time for one round trip is:

Time = 2 x 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so the number of round trips the train can make in a day is:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours
Number of round trips ≈ 3.6

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of round trips = 3

Therefore, the train can make approximately 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
