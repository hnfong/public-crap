### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 has several interesting mathematical and cultural properties. Here are some of them:

1. **Factorial Significance**: 120 is 5! (5 factorial), which means 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. This makes it the product of the first five positive integers.

2. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors in total).

3. **Sum of Consecutive Integers**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers in multiple ways, such as:
   - 39 + 40 + 41 = 120
   - 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 = 120
   - 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 = 120

4. **Triangular Number**: 120 is a triangular number because it can be represented as the sum of the first 15 positive integers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120.

5. **Harmonic Divisor Number**: 120 is a harmonic divisor number (or Ore number), meaning the harmonic mean of its divisors is an integer. The harmonic mean of its divisors is 6.

6. **Geometric Properties**: In geometry, 120 is the internal angle measure of a regular hexagon (each interior angle is 120 degrees).

7. **Cultural Significance**: In some cultures, 120 is considered a significant number. For example, in ancient Babylonian mathematics, the number 120 was used in their sexagesimal (base-60) system. In Judaism, the age of Moses at his death is 120 years, and this is considered the ideal lifespan.

8. **Binary and Other Bases**: 
   - In binary, 120 is represented as 1111000.
   - In base 3, it is 11110.
   - In base 4, it is 1320.
   - In base 5, it is 440.
   - In base 6, it is 320.
   - In base 7, it is 231.
   - In base 8, it is 170.
   - In base 9, it is 143.
   - In base 10, it is 120.

9. **Sum of Squares**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of two squares in two different ways:
   - 10² + 2² = 100 + 4 = 104 (not 120, so this is incorrect. Actually, 120 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares. My apologies for the mistake.)
   - Correction: 120 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares because in its prime factorization (2³ × 3 × 5), the primes 3 and 5 are of the form 4k + 3 and have odd exponents, which violates the necessary condition for a number to be expressible as the sum of two squares.

10. **Sum of Factorials**: 120 is the sum of the factorials of the first five positive integers: 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 = 153 (not 120, so this is incorrect. My apologies for the mistake.)
    - Correction: 120 is not the sum of the factorials of the first five positive integers. The correct sum is 153 as shown above.

11. **Other Properties**:
    - 120 is the smallest number to appear 6 times in Pascal's triangle.
    - 120 is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61).
    - 120 is the 15th triangular number, as mentioned earlier.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**
To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula or factorization. I will use factorization first, and if that doesn't work, I'll use the quadratic formula.

#### Step 1: Attempt Factorization
We need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 (the constant term) and add up to -7 (the coefficient of x).

Let's list the factor pairs of -18:
1. 1 and -18: 1 + (-18) = -17 (not -7)
2. -1 and 18: -1 + 18 = 17 (not -7)
3. 2 and -9: 2 + (-9) = -7 (this matches!)
4. -2 and 9: -2 + 9 = 7 (not -7)
5. 3 and -6: 3 + (-6) = -3 (not -7)
6. -3 and 6: -3 + 6 = 3 (not -7)

The pair that works is 2 and -9. So, we can factor the equation as:
\[ (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0 \]

#### Step 2: Solve for x
Set each factor equal to zero:
1. \( x + 2 = 0 \) → \( x = -2 \)
2. \( x - 9 = 0 \) → \( x = 9 \)

#### Verification:
Let's plug the solutions back into the original equation to verify:
1. For \( x = -2 \):
   \( (-2)^2 - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 \) ✔️
2. For \( x = 9 \):
   \( 9^2 - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 \) ✔️

#### Alternative Method: Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
For the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -18 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

Now, find the square root of the discriminant:
\[ \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

Now, apply the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

So, the two solutions are:
1. \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

This confirms our earlier solutions.

**Final Answer:** The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \) are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 9 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours), we'll follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Calculate the time for one round trip
A round trip consists of traveling from City A to City B and then back from City B to City A. The distance between the two cities is 200 km, so:
- One-way distance = 200 km
- Round trip distance = 2 × 200 km = 400 km

The train's average speed is 60 km/h. The time taken for one round trip is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} \]

Calculate this:
\[ \frac{400}{60} = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.\overline{6} \text{ hours} \]
So, one round trip takes \( \frac{20}{3} \) hours, or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes.

#### Step 2: Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours
Now, we need to find how many such round trips fit into 24 hours. Let \( n \) be the number of round trips. Then:
\[ n \times \frac{20}{3} \leq 24 \]

Solve for \( n \):
\[ n \leq \frac{24 \times 3}{20} \]
\[ n \leq \frac{72}{20} \]
\[ n \leq 3.6 \]

Since the number of round trips must be
