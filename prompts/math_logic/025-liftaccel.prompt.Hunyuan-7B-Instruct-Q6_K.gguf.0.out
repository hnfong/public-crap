Let's solve each question step by step.

### **1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

#### Step 1: Total height of the building
Each floor is 5 meters tall, and there are 40 floors. The total height of the building is:
$$
\text{Total height} = 40 \times 5 = 200 \, \text{meters}.
$$

#### Step 2: Motion phases of the elevator
The elevator accelerates, moves at constant speed, and decelerates. The motion consists of three phases:
1. **Acceleration phase**: The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of $5 \, \text{m/s}$ with an acceleration of $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
2. **Constant speed phase**: The elevator moves at a constant speed of $5 \, \text{m/s}$.
3. **Deceleration phase**: The elevator decelerates from $5 \, \text{m/s}$ to rest with an acceleration of $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

#### Step 3: Time for acceleration and deceleration
The time to accelerate from rest to $5 \, \text{m/s}$ is:
$$
t_{\text{accel}} = \frac{\text{final velocity} - \text{initial velocity}}{\text{acceleration}} = \frac{5 - 0}{1} = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
$$
The time to decelerate from $5 \, \text{m/s}$ to rest is the same:
$$
t_{\text{decel}} = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 4: Distance covered during acceleration and deceleration
The distance covered during acceleration is:
$$
d_{\text{accel}} = \frac{\text{initial velocity} + \text{final velocity}}{2} \times t_{\text{accel}} = \frac{0 + 5}{2} \times 5 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}.
$$
The distance covered during deceleration is the same:
$$
d_{\text{decel}} = 12.5 \, \text{meters}.
$$

#### Step 5: Distance covered at constant speed
The total distance is $200 \, \text{meters}$. Subtract the distances covered during acceleration and deceleration:
$$
d_{\text{constant}} = 200 - (12.5 + 12.5) = 175 \, \text{meters}.
$$
The time spent at constant speed is:
$$
t_{\text{constant}} = \frac{d_{\text{constant}}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 6: Total time
The total time is the sum of the times for acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{constant}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

**Answer to Question 1:**
$$
\boxed{45 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

### **2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

#### Step 1: Height of the first person's destination
The first person goes to the 10th floor. The height of the 10th floor is:
$$
\text{Height of 10/F} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{meters}.
$$

#### Step 2: Height of the second person's destination
The second person goes to the 30th floor. The height of the 30th floor is:
$$
\text{Height of 30/F} = 30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{meters}.
$$

#### Step 3: Time for the first person to reach the 10th floor
Using the same method as in Question 1, the total time for the first person to reach the 10th floor is:
$$
t_{\text{10/F}} = 45 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 4: Time for the second person to reach the 30th floor
Using the same method as in Question 1, the total time for the second person to reach the 30th floor is:
$$
t_{\text{30/F}} = 45 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 5: Total time for both people
Since both people are on the same elevator, the total time is determined by the slower person, who is the second person going to the 30th floor.

**Answer to Question 2:**
$$
\boxed{45 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

### **3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

#### Step 1: Minimum time condition
To minimize the total time, the elevator should stop at the highest possible floor before reaching the 40th floor. This ensures that the elevator spends as little time as possible decelerating and accelerating at intermediate stops.

#### Step 2: Stop at the 39th floor
The elevator stops at the 39th floor, which is the highest floor below the 40th floor. The height of the 39th floor is:
$$
\text{Height of 39/F} = 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{meters}.
$$

#### Step 3: Time to reach the 39th floor
Using the same method as in Question 1, the total time to reach the 39th floor is:
$$
t_{\text{39/F}} = 45 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 4: Deceleration from 39/F to 40/F
The elevator decelerates from $5 \, \text{m/s}$ to rest over the last 5 meters (height of the 40th floor). The time to decelerate is:
$$
t_{\text{decel}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{average velocity}} = \frac{5}{\frac{5 + 0}{2}} = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

#### Step 5: Total time to reach the 40th floor
The total time is the sum of the time to reach the 39th floor and the time to decelerate to the 40th floor:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{39/F}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 45 + 5 = 50 \, \text{seconds}.
$$

**Answer to Question 3:**
$$
\boxed{50 \, \text{seconds}}
$$
