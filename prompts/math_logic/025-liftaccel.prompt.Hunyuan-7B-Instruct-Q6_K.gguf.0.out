### **Step 1: General information**
- **Height of the building**: $40 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 200 \, \text{m}$
- **Acceleration/deceleration**: $a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2$
- **Maximum speed**: $v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s}$

---

### **Step 2: Key equations**
1. **Velocity-time relationship**:  
   $$
   v = v_0 + at
$$
   where $v_0 = 0 \, \text{m/s}$ (starting from rest).

2. **Position-time relationship**:  
   $$
   s = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
$$
   where $v_0 = 0 \, \text{m/s}$.

3. **Time to reach maximum speed**:  
   $$
   t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
$$

4. **Distance covered at maximum speed**:  
   $$
   s_{\text{max}} = v_{\text{max}} \cdot t_{\text{max}} = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \, \text{m}
$$

5. **Time to decelerate from maximum speed to rest**:  
   $$
   t_{\text{decel}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = 5 \, \text{s}
$$

6. **Distance covered while decelerating**:  
   $$
   s_{\text{decel}} = v_{\text{max}} \cdot t_{\text{decel}} - \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{decel}}^2 = 5 \cdot 5 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 25 - 12.5 = 12.5 \, \text{m}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total distance covered during acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration**
$$
s_{\text{total}} = s_{\text{accel}} + s_{\text{max}} + s_{\text{decel}}
$$
$$
s_{\text{total}} = 12.5 + 25 + 12.5 = 50 \, \text{m}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time to cover 50 m**
The lift accelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, covers $25 \, \text{m}$, decelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, and covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$. The total time to cover $50 \, \text{m}$ is:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{max}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s}
$$

### **Step 5: Answers to the questions**

#### **1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**
The total distance is $200 \, \text{m}$. The lift accelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, covers $25 \, \text{m}$, decelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, and covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$. The remaining distance is:
$$
s_{\text{remaining}} = 200 - 50 = 150 \, \text{m}
$$

The lift continues at maximum speed ($5 \, \text{m/s}$) for the remaining distance:
$$
t_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{s_{\text{remaining}}}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{150}{5} = 30 \, \text{s}
$$

The total time is:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{max}} + t_{\text{decel}} + t_{\text{remaining}} = 5 + 5 + 5 + 30 = 45 \, \text{s}
$$

**Answer**: $45 \, \text{s}$

#### **2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to $10/F$ and second person goes to $30/F$. How long does it take?**

- **Distance for the first person**: $10 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 50 \, \text{m}$
- **Distance for the second person**: $30 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 150 \, \text{m}$

The first person reaches the top of their journey ($50 \, \text{m}$) in $15 \, \text{s}$ (as calculated earlier). After reaching $50 \, \text{m}$, the lift decelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$ and covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$. The total distance covered during acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration is:
$$
s_{\text{total}} = 50 \, \text{m}
$$

The remaining distance for the second person is:
$$
s_{\text{remaining}} = 150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{m}
$$

The second person continues at maximum speed ($5 \, \text{m/s}$) for the remaining distance:
$$
t_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{s_{\text{remaining}}}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \, \text{s}
$$

The total time is:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{first person}} + t_{\text{remaining}} = 15 + 20 = 35 \, \text{s}
$$

**Answer**: $35 \, \text{s}$

#### **3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to $40/F$. Assuming the second person does not go to the same ($40/F$) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to $40/F$ if it has to stop at another floor between $1/F$ and $40/F$?**

To minimize the total time, the lift should stop at the highest possible floor before $40/F$ such that the second person can reach their destination. Let the stop floor be $n$ floors above the ground.

- **Distance to the stop floor**: $n \times 5 = 5n \, \text{m}$
- **Distance from the stop floor to $40/F$**: $(40 - n) \times 5 = 200 - 5n \, \text{m}$

The total time is the sum of the time to reach the stop floor and the time to reach $40/F$ from the stop floor.

1. **Time to reach the stop floor**:  
   The lift accelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, covers $25 \, \text{m}$, decelerates for $5 \, \text{s}$, and covers $12.5 \, \text{m}$. The remaining distance is:
   $$
   s_{\text{remaining}} = 5n - 50
$$
   The time to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed is:
   $$
   t_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{s_{\text{remaining}}}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{5n - 50}{5} = n - 10 \, \text{s}
$$
   The total time to reach the stop floor is:
   $$
   t_{\text{stop}} = 15 + (n - 10
