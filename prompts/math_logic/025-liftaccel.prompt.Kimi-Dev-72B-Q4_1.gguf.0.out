◁think▷Okay, let's tackle these problems step by step. 

First, the building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. So the total height from ground to top is 40 * 5 = 200 meters. The elevator has an acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s² and a max speed of 5 m/s. 

For question 1: How long to go from ground to top (200 meters). The elevator needs to accelerate to max speed, travel at that speed, then decelerate. Let's figure out the time for each phase.

The time to accelerate to max speed is v = a*t → t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds. The distance covered during acceleration is d = 0.5*a*t² = 0.5*1*5² = 12.5 meters. Same for deceleration. So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. The remaining distance is 200 - 25 = 175 meters, which is traveled at max speed of 5 m/s. Time for that is 175/5 = 35 seconds. Adding all phases: 5 (accel) + 35 (constant) + 5 (decel) = 45 seconds. So the total time is 45 seconds.

Now question 2: Two people, first to 10/F (50 meters), second to 30/F (150 meters). The elevator needs to stop at 10/F first, then proceed to 30/F. Let's calculate each leg.

From ground to 10/F (50 meters). Accelerate to max speed. Let's see: time to reach max speed is 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters. Then, remaining distance is 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters. At max speed, time is 37.5/5 = 7.5 seconds. Then decelerate for 5 seconds. Total time for first stop: 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 seconds.

Then from 10/F to 30/F (150 - 50 = 100 meters). The elevator starts from rest again (assuming it stops completely). Accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Remaining distance: 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters. At max speed: 87.5/5 = 17.5 seconds. Then decelerate: 5 seconds. Total time for second leg: 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds. Adding both legs: 17.5 + 27.5 = 45 seconds. Wait, but that's the same as going directly to 40/F. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, when the elevator stops at 10/F, does it decelerate to a stop and then accelerate again? If so, each leg is treated as a separate trip. So for the first part (ground to 10/F), the elevator accelerates, travels, then decelerates to stop. Then, after the first person gets off, the elevator accelerates again from rest to go to 30/F. So each leg is a complete trip from rest to rest.

So for the first leg (50 meters):

The elevator accelerates to max speed. Let's calculate how far it can go in acceleration. The max speed is 5 m/s, so time to reach that is 5 seconds. Distance covered during acceleration: 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters. Then, after reaching max speed, it travels the remaining distance. But wait, 50 meters total. If acceleration covers 12.5, then deceleration would also cover 12.5. So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 25 meters. The remaining distance is 50 - 25 = 25 meters. Time at max speed: 25/5 = 5 seconds. So total time for first leg: 5 (accel) + 5 (constant) + 5 (decel) = 15 seconds. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the total distance is 50 meters. The acceleration phase covers 12.5 meters, then the deceleration phase also covers 12.5 meters. So the distance at max speed is 50 - 25 = 25 meters. Time at max speed: 25/5 = 5 seconds. So total time is 5 (accel) + 5 (constant) + 5 (decel) = 15 seconds. Then, for the second leg (100 meters):

Acceleration phase: 12.5 meters. Deceleration phase: 12.5 meters. Remaining distance: 100 - 25 = 75 meters. Time at max speed: 75/5 = 15 seconds. Total time: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds. Adding both legs: 15 + 25 = 40 seconds. But earlier I thought it was 45. So maybe the first calculation was wrong. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the first question's total time was 45 seconds for 200 meters. Let's see: 200 meters. Acceleration and deceleration each cover 12.5 meters, total 25. Remaining 175 meters at max speed. 175/5 = 35 seconds. Total time: 5 + 35 + 5 = 45. So that's correct. Now for 50 meters:

Total distance is 50. Acceleration and deceleration each 12.5. So remaining distance is 50 - 25 = 25. Time at max speed: 25/5 = 5. Total time: 5 +5 +5 =15 seconds. Then 100 meters: remaining 75, time 15. Total 25 seconds. So total time for both stops is 15 + 25 = 40 seconds. So the answer for question 2 is 40 seconds.

Now question 3: Two people, first goes to 40/F, second to another floor between 1 and 40. The minimum time to reach 40/F when stopping at another floor. The problem is to find the minimum time, which would occur when the other floor is as close to 40/F as possible. Let's say the other floor is 39/F. Then the elevator goes from ground to 39/F, stops, then to 40/F. But maybe the elevator can continue without stopping again. Wait, the problem says the second person does not go to 40/F, so the elevator has to stop at another floor first. So the minimum time would be when the other floor is the closest possible, like 39/F. But how does that affect the time?

Alternatively, maybe the elevator can go to the other floor first, then proceed to 40/F without decelerating again. But if the other floor is on the way, like 20/F, then the elevator stops there, then continues to 40/F. The time would be the time to reach 20/F, then the time from 20/F to 40/F. But how does that compare to going directly to 40/F?

Wait, the first scenario (direct to 40/F) takes 45 seconds. If the elevator stops at another floor, say 20/F (100 meters), then proceeds to 40/F (another 100 meters), the total time would be the time for two 100-meter trips. Let's calculate that.

For each 100-meter trip:

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Remaining distance: 100 - 25 = 75 meters. Time at max speed: 75/5 = 15 seconds. Total time per trip: 5 +15 +5 =25 seconds. So two trips: 25 +25 =50 seconds. But that's longer than the direct trip. So the minimum time would be when the other floor is as close to 40/F as possible, so that the time added is minimal.

Wait, maybe the other floor is 39/F. Then the elevator goes from ground to 39/F (195 meters), stops, then to 40/F (5 meters). Let's calculate the time for each leg.

First leg (195 meters):

Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Remaining distance: 195 - 25 = 170 meters. Time at max speed: 170/5 = 34 seconds. Total time: 5 +34 +5 =44 seconds. Then from 39/F to 40/F (5 meters):

Acceleration: Let's see. The elevator starts from rest again. Acceleration to max speed. But 5 meters is less than the 12.5 meters needed to reach max speed. So in this case, the elevator accelerates until it reaches the distance. Let's solve for time when distance is 5 meters. d = 0.5*a*t² → 5 = 0.5*1*t² → t² =10 → t ≈3.16 seconds. So the elevator accelerates for 3.16 seconds, reaches a speed of 3.16 m/s, then decelerates. Wait, but the distance is 5 meters. So maybe the elevator just accelerates to the midpoint and then decelerates. Let's see: total distance is 5 meters. So time to reach midpoint (2.5 meters) is t = sqrt(2*2.5/1) = sqrt(5) ≈2.24 seconds. Then decelerate for the same time. Total time: 2.24 *2 ≈4.48 seconds. So the total time for
