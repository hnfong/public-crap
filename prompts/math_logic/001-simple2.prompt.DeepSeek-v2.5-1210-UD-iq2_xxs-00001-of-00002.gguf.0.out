### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**

The number 120 has several interesting properties and historical significance:

1. **Triangular Number:** 120 is a triangular number. It is the sum of the first 15 positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 15 = 120\).

2. **Factorial:** 120 is the product of the first five positive integers: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

3. **Abundant Number:** 120 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60) is greater than 120. The sum of its proper divisors is 240.

4. **Historical Significance:** In ancient times, 120 was used in various contexts. For example, in the Bible, there were 120 members of the Great Assembly after the flood.

5. **Hexagonal Number:** 120 is also a hexagonal number, which can be represented as a hexagon with 15 points on each side.

6. **Sum of Squares:** 120 can be expressed as the sum of four squares: \(120 = 8^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 2^2\).

These properties make 120 a fascinating number in mathematics and history.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Answer:**

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]

2. **Find the square root of the discriminant:**
   \[
   \sqrt{121} = 11
   \]

3. **Apply the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the two solutions:**
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**

To determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to calculate the total time available in a day and the time required for one round trip.

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time for one trip (one way):**
   \[
   \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   \[
   \text{Time for one round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time available in a day:**
   \[
   \text{Total time in a day} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of round trips:**
   \[
   \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time in a day}}{\text{Time for one round trip}} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Final Answer:**

The train can make **3** round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
