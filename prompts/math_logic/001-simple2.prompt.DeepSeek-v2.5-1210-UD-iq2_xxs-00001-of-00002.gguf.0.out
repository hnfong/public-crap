### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**

The number 120 has several interesting properties and historical significance:

1. **Triangular Number:** 120 is a triangular number. It is the sum of the first 15 positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 15 = 120\).

2. **Factorial:** 120 is the product of the first five positive integers: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

3. **Abundant Number:** 120 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60) is greater than 120.

4. **Historical Significance:** In ancient times, 120 was used in various contexts, such as the number of Psalms in the Book of Psalms and the number of members of the Great Sanhedrin, the supreme court in ancient Israel.

5. **Hexagonal Number:** 120 is also a hexagonal number, which can be represented as a hexagon with 15 points on each side.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Answer:**

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. **Calculate the discriminant:**

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
\]

2. **Find the roots:**

\[
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
\]

3. **Calculate the two solutions:**

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
\[
x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the time for one trip:**

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h.

\[
\text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip:**

A round trip consists of traveling from one city to the other and back.

\[
\text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day:**

A full day has 24 hours.

\[
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per round trip}} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
\]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Final Answer:**

The train can make 3 complete round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
