Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

A1: The number 120 is significant in mathematics and has several interesting properties. Here are some of them:

1. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the product of four distinct prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7).
2. It is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
3. It is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120).
4. It is the product of the first four triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, and 10).
5. It is the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 10 items (10C3 = 120).
6. It is the number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5).
7. It is the number of seconds in 2 minutes.
8. It is the number of minutes in 2 hours.
9. It is the number of hours in 5 days.
10. It is the number of days in 16 weeks.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

So, the solutions are:

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A3: To determine how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance it can travel in 24 hours and then divide that by the distance between the two cities.

First, let's find the total distance the train can travel in 24 hours:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 km/h × 24 h
Distance = 1440 km

Now, let's divide the total distance by the distance between the two cities to find the number of round trips:

Number of round trips = Total distance / Distance between cities
Number of round trips = 1440 km / 200 km
Number of round trips = 7.2

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of round trips = 7

Therefore, the train can make 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
