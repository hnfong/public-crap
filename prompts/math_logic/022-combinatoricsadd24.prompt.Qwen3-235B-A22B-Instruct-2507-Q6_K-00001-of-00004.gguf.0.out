Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24  
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), but we used 4 twice and didn't use 1. Invalid. Retrying  

Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) * 1 = 8 / 1 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 * 3 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21, not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 4 * 3 * (1) + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20, not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1 â€” all used exactly once.  
Correct!

Final answer:  
```
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1). Correct!
