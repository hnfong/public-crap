"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

I think I understand what this means, but I'll start with a cautious explanation and provide examples to ensure I'm correct.

The statement suggests a rough estimate or a mental shortcut to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. It claims that for every 12°C, the digits of the temperature in Celsius are inverted when converted to Fahrenheit.

Let's break it down:

* "Every 12°C" implies that we're looking at temperatures that are multiples of 12°C, such as 12°C, 24°C, 36°C, and so on.
* "The digits are inverted" means that the tens and ones digits are swapped when converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Here are some examples to test this claim:

1. 12°C ≈ 54°F (not exactly inverted, but close)
2. 24°C ≈ 75°F (not exactly inverted)
3. 36°C ≈ 97°F (not exactly inverted)
4. 48°C ≈ 118°F (not exactly inverted)

Hmm, it seems my initial understanding was incorrect. The statement doesn't quite hold true. The digits aren't exactly inverted when converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

However, I noticed that the statement might be a rough approximation. If we look at the temperatures, we can see that the Fahrenheit values are roughly the inverse of the Celsius values, but not exactly.

A more accurate way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to use the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.

If you'd like, I can try to rephrase or reinterpret the original statement to make it more accurate or useful. [end of text]
