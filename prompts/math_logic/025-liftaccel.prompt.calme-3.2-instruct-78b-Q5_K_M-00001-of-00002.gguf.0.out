To solve these problems, we need to understand the dynamics of the lift's motion. The lift accelerates at 1 m/s^2 until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s, then it travels at this constant speed, and finally decelerates at 1 m/s^2 to come to a stop at the destination floor.

First, let's find the time it takes to accelerate to the maximum speed and the distance covered during this acceleration phase.

If \(a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2\) and \(v = 5 \, \text{m/s}\), then the time to accelerate to the maximum speed is \(t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}\).

The distance covered during this acceleration phase is \(d = \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}\).

Since the deceleration phase is symmetrical to the acceleration phase, it also takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5 meters.

The total height of the building is \(40 \times 5 = 200 \, \text{m}\).

The distance covered at constant speed is \(200 - 2 \times 12.5 = 175 \, \text{m}\).

The time spent at constant speed is \(\frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s}\).

So, the total time to travel from the ground floor to the top floor is \(5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{s}\).

1. The time for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is 45 seconds.

For question 2, we need to consider the distance to 10/F and 30/F.

The height to 10/F is \(10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{m}\).

The height to 30/F is \(30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m}\).

The time to 10/F is the time to accelerate to the maximum speed (5 s) plus the time to decelerate (5 s), since the maximum speed is not reached. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 25 m, so the remaining distance is 25 m. The time to cover this distance at constant speed is \(\frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{s}\). So, the total time to 10/F is \(5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s}\).

To continue to 30/F, the lift needs to accelerate again (5 s), reach the maximum speed (100 m at 5 m/s = 20 s), and decelerate (5 s). So, the total time from 10/F to 30/F is \(5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \, \text{s}\).

The total time for both stops is \(15 + 30 = 45 \, \text{s}\).

2. The time for the lift to reach 10/F and then 30/F is 45 seconds.

For question 3, we need to find the minimum time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor. The best scenario is when the stop is at the halfway point, minimizing the time lost due to deceleration and acceleration.

The height to the halfway point is \(20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m}\).

The time to 20/F is the time to accelerate to the maximum speed (5 s) plus the time to decelerate (5 s), plus the time to cover the remaining distance at constant speed (50 m at 5 m/s = 10 s). So, the total time to 20/F is \(5 + 10 + 5 = 20 \, \text{s}\).

To continue to 40/F, the lift needs to accelerate again (5 s), reach the maximum speed (100 m at 5 m/s = 20 s), and decelerate (5 s). So, the total time from 20/F to 40/F is \(5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \, \text{s}\).

The total time for both segments is \(20 + 30 = 50 \, \text{s}\).

3. The minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor is 50 seconds. 

It's important to note that in real-world scenarios, additional time would be added for the lift to stop and start, and for people to enter and exit the lift, but these factors are not considered in this simplified model. [end of text]
