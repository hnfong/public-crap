Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

I'll do my best to answer all the questions.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s.

First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the lift. Since each floor is 5 meters tall, the total distance is:

Distance = 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters

Since the lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, we can use the equation:

s = ut + (1/2)at^2

where s is the distance, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), t is the time, and a is the acceleration (1 m/s^2).

Rearranging the equation to solve for t, we get:

t = sqrt(2s/a)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = sqrt(2 x 200 meters / 1 m/s^2)
t = sqrt(400)
t = 20 seconds

Since the lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, we need to add the time it takes to decelerate:

t_total = t_acceleration + t_deceleration
t_total = 20 seconds + 20 seconds
t_total = 40 seconds

Therefore, it takes 40 seconds for the lift to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s for each person.

For the first person going to 10/F, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 9 floors x 5 meters/floor = 45 meters

Using the same equation as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
t = sqrt(2 x 45 meters / 1 m/s^2)
t = sqrt(90)
t = 9.49 seconds

For the second person going to 30/F, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 29 floors x 5 meters/floor = 145 meters

Using the same equation as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
t = sqrt(2 x 145 meters / 1 m/s^2)
t = sqrt(290)
t = 17.08 seconds

Since the lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, we need to add the time it takes to accelerate:

t_acceleration = 9.49 seconds + 17.08 seconds
t_acceleration = 26.57 seconds

Since the lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, we need to add the time it takes to decelerate:

t_deceleration = 26.57 seconds + 26.57 seconds
t_deceleration = 53.14 seconds

Therefore, it takes 53.14 seconds for the lift to get from the ground floor to the 10/F and 30/F floors.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s.

Since the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, let's assume it stops at the floor just before 40/F, which is 39/F.

The distance traveled is:

Distance = 39 floors x 5 meters/floor = 195 meters

Using the same equation as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
t = sqrt(2 x 195 meters / 1 m/s^2)
t = sqrt(390)
t = 19.95 seconds

Since the lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, we need to add the time it takes to accelerate:

t_acceleration = 19.95 seconds

Since the lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, we need to add the time it takes to decelerate:

t_deceleration = 19.95 seconds + 19.95 seconds
t_deceleration = 39.9 seconds

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 39.9 seconds. [end of text]
