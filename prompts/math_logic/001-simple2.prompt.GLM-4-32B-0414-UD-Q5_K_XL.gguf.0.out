### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics and other fields:

1. **Factorial:** 120 is the factorial of 5, i.e., \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
2. **Triangular Number:** It is the 15th triangular number, which means it can be represented as the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 15 = 120\).
3. **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
4. **Ancient Significance:** In ancient times, the number 120 was sometimes used to represent a large but finite quantity (e.g., in the Bible, God initially limits human lifespan to 120 years).
5. **Geometry:** A regular icosahedron (a 20-sided polyhedron) has 120 rotational symmetries.
6. **Time Measurement:** There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes and 120 minutes in 2 hours.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Answer:**
To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

**Steps:**
1. Identify the coefficients:
   - \(a = 1\)
   - \(b = -7\)
   - \(c = -18\)
2. Plug the values into the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} \]
   \[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} \]
   \[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} \]
   \[ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]
3. Solve for the two possible values of \(x\):
   - \(x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\)
   - \(x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)

**Final Answer:**
The solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours), follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   - Distance between the two cities: 200 km.
   - Round trip distance: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\).
   - Speed of the train: 60 km/h.
   - Time for one round trip: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.6667 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**
   - Number of round trips = \(\frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\).

Since the train cannot complete a fraction of a round trip, it can make **3 full round trips** in a full day.

**Final Answer:**
The train can make **3 round trips** in a full day. [end of text]
