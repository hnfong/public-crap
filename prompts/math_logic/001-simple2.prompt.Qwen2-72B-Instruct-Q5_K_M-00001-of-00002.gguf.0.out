Q1: The number 120 is significant in various ways, here are some of its interesting properties:
1. In mathematics, 120 is a highly composite number, as it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It is also a Harshad number since it is divisible by the sum of its digits.
2. It is the smallest number with six different positive divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
3. In religion and mythology, there are many references to the number 120. In the Bible, it is the age to which Moses lived and also the number of years of the flood warning in the story of Noah.
4. In physics, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 120,000 km/s.
5. In finance, 120 is the number of days in a quarter.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a
where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.
Substituting these values, we get:
x = [ 7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)) ] / 2(1)
x = [ 7 ± sqrt(49 + 72) ] / 2
x = [ 7 ± sqrt(121) ] / 2
x = [ 7 ± 11 ] / 2
x = 9 or x = -2
Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To calculate how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to find the total travel time for one round trip and then divide the number of hours in a day by the total travel time.
The distance between the two cities is 200 km and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. So, the time taken for one way trip is:
time = distance / speed = 200 / 60 = 3.33 hours (rounded to two decimal places)
Therefore, the total time for one round trip is 2 * 3.33 = 6.66 hours (rounded to two decimal places).
Since there are 24 hours in a day, the number of round trips the train can make within a day is:
number of round trips = 24 / 6.66 = 3.60 (rounded to two decimal places)
However, since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, the maximum number of round trips the train can make within a day is 3.
