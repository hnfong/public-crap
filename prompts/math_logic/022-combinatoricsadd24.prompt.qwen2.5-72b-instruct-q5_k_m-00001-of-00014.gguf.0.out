```
Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) * 3 = 7 * 1 * 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 - (4 - 1) = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Correct!
