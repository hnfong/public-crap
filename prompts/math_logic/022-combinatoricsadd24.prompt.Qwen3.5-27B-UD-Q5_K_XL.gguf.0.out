Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect (used 4 twice, missed 1). Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 * 1 * (4 / 4) = 24 * 1 * 1 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 3, 1, 4, 4), which is incorrect (used 4 twice). Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 16. Retrying
Attempt: 8 / (1 - 3/4) = 8 / (1/4) = 32. Not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24.
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * (5 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24.
Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1. All numbers from the set (4, 3, 1, 8) are used exactly once.
Result is 24. Success.
