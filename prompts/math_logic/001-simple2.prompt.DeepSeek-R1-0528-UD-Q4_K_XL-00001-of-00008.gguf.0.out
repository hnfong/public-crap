I need to answer all three questions. Let's start with Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

120 is a number with a lot of mathematical properties. First, it's a factorial. 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. That's significant in combinatorics and probability.

It's also a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me list its divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors. And yes, numbers smaller than 120 have fewer divisors. For example, 60 has 12 divisors.

120 is also the smallest number to be divisible by the first five positive integers: 1,2,3,4,5. Well, 1 divides everything, but 120 is a multiple of 1 through 6, actually, since 6 divides 120 too. 120 ÷ 6 = 20. So it's the least common multiple of 1 through 6? LCM of 1 to 6. LCM of 1,2,3,4,5,6. Since 4=2^2 and 6=2×3, so LCM is 2^2 × 3 × 5 = 4×3×5=60? 60 is smaller, and 60 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6? 60÷4=15, yes; 60÷5=12, yes; 60÷6=10, yes. But 120 is also divisible, but 60 is smaller. 60 is the smallest number divisible by 1 through 6? What about 30? 30÷4=7.5, not integer, so no. 20? 20÷3 not integer. 12? 12÷5 not integer. So yes, 60 is the smallest number divisible by 1 through 6. But 120 is divisible by 1 through 8? 120÷7≈17.14, not integer. 7 doesn't divide 120. 120÷7 is not whole number. So 120 is not divisible by 7. But it is divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10, etc.

Perhaps I should say 120 is the multiple of the first five triangular numbers or something? Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15. 1×3×6×10×15= let's see, 1×3=3, ×6=18, ×10=180, ×15=2700, not 120. Not that.

120 is 5!, as I said.

In time, 120 minutes is 2 hours.

In angles, 120 degrees is the internal angle of a hexagon, since (6-2)×180/6 = 4×30=120 degrees for each internal angle in a regular hexagon.

Also, in binary, 120 is 1111000, but not sure if that's interesting.

It's a Harshad number, meaning it's divisible by the sum of its digits: 1+2+0=3, and 120÷3=40, yes.

Also, it's the sum of four consecutive primes: 23 + 29 + 31 + 37? 23+29=52, +31=83, +37=120, yes.

Or 19+23+29+31? 19+23=42, +29=71, +31=102, not 120. 17+19+23+29=17+19=36, +23=59, +29=88, no. So 23,29,31,37 works.

Also, 120 is 8×15, or 10×12, etc.

I think that's enough for Q1.

Now Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

This is a quadratic equation. I can factor it or use quadratic formula.

Factoring: I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Factors of -18: (1,-18), (2,-9), (3,-6), (6,-3), (9,-2), (18,-1), and negative pairs like (-1,18), etc.

Which pair adds to -7? 2 and -9: 2 + (-9) = -7, and 2×(-9) = -18. Yes.

So (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0? Let me check: (x+2)(x-9) = x^2 -9x +2x -18 = x^2 -7x -18. Yes.

So solutions are x = -2 or x = 9.

Using quadratic formula: x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± √121]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2

So x = (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9 or x = (7-11)/2 = -4/2 = -2.

Same thing.

So roots are x=9 and x=-2.

Now Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

First, a round trip is going from A to B and back to A, so distance is 2 × 200 km = 400 km.

Speed is 60 km/h, so time for one round trip is distance/speed = 400 km / 60 km/h.

Calculate that: 400 / 60 = 40/6 = 20/3 hours per round trip.

20/3 hours is approximately 6.666 hours.

Now, a full day is 24 hours.

So number of round trips in 24 hours is total time / time per trip = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × 3/20 = (24/20) × 3 = (6/5) × 3 = 18/5 = 3.6

But number of trips must be integer, so it can make 3 full round trips, and part of a fourth, but since it has to be complete trips, it can make 3 round trips.

3.6 means 3 full trips and 0.6 of another, but since we need complete round trips, it should be 3.

But let me confirm the time.

Time for one round trip: 400 km / 60 km/h = 400/60 = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 hours.

For three round trips: 3 × 20/3 = 20 hours.

Then, in 24 hours, after 20 hours, it has 4 hours left.

In 4 hours, it can travel 4 × 60 = 240 km.

But a round trip is 400 km, so 240 km is not enough for a full round trip; it can go to the other city but not come back.

From A to B is 200 km, which takes 200/60 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 hours.

In 4 hours, it can go from A to B in 3.333 hours, arriving at B with 4 - 3.333 = 0.667 hours left, but since it needs to come back, which takes another 3.333 hours, it doesn't have time. So it can only complete the trip to B, but not back, so it doesn't count as a round trip.

Therefore, only 3 full round trips.

The question says "round trips", so it must be complete there and back.

Also, it says "within a full day", and time stationed is negligible, so we don't consider waiting time.

So in 24 hours, it can make 3 round trips.

But let me see the calculation: 24 / (400/60) = 24 * 60 / 400 = (24/400) * 60, better: 24 * 60 / 400.

Simplify: 24/400 = 24÷8 / 400÷8 = 3/50? 24÷8=3, 400÷8=50, so 3/50.

Then 3/50 * 60 = 3 * 60 / 50 = 180 / 50 = 18/5 = 3.6, same as before.

Since time per one way is 200/60 = 10/3 hours, so round trip 20/3 hours.

Number of round trips: floor(24 / (20/3)) = floor(24 * 3/20) = floor(72/20) = floor(3.6) = 3.

Yes.

If we think in terms of distance, total distance it can cover in 24 hours is 24 * 60 = 1440 km.

Each round trip is 400 km, so 1440 / 400 = 3.6, so 3 full round trips.

Yes.

So answer should be 3.

But let me make sure about the full day. Is it exactly 24 hours? I think so.

Also, average speed is given, and distance, so time is straightforward.

No acceleration or anything, since it says average speed.

So I think it's fine.

Now, for the answers.

Q1: I need to list properties.

Q2: Solve equation.

Q3: Number of round trips.

Also, for Q1, I should provide steps or just list?

The question says "provide steps" for all, but for Q1, it's properties, so I can list them.

Similarly for Q3, I have steps.

For Q2, I have steps.

So I think I'm good.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several significant and interesting properties in mathematics, science, and everyday contexts. Here are some key points:

1. **Factorial Number**:  
   - 120 is the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!.  
   - Calculation: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).  
   - Factorials are important in combinatorics, probability, and algebra for counting permutations and combinations.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   - 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.  
   - Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors in total).  
   - This property makes it useful in areas like number theory and divisibility rules.

3. **Mathematical Properties**:  
   - **Sum of Four Consecutive Primes**: \(120 = 23 + 29 + 31 + 37\).  
   - **Harshad Number**: 120 is divisible by the sum of its digits (\(1 + 2 + 0 = 3\)), since \(120 \div 3 = 40\).  
   - **Triangular Number Connection**: 120 is the 15th triangular number (sum of the first 15 integers: \(1 + 2 + \cdots + 15 = 120\)).  
   - **Binary Representation**: In binary, 120 is written as 1111000, which may be of interest in computing.

4. **Geometric Significance**:  
   - In a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees.  
   - Calculation: For a polygon with \(n\) sides, the internal angle is \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}\); for \(n=6\), \(\frac{4 \times 180}{6} = 120^\circ\).

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Here are the steps for both methods:

#### Method 1: Factoring
1. We need two numbers that multiply to the constant term (-18) and add to the coefficient of the linear term (-7).  
   - Possible pairs: Factors of -18 are (1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6), etc.  
   - The pair that adds to -7: \(2 + (-9) = -7\) and \(2 \times (-9) = -18\).  
2. Rewrite the equation using these factors:  
   \((x + 2)(x - 9) = 0\).  
3. Set each factor to zero and solve for \(x\):  
   - \(x + 2 = 0\) → \(x = -2\)  
   - \(x - 9 = 0\) → \(x = 9\)  

#### Method 2: Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).  
1. Calculate the discriminant:  
   \(b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121\).  
2. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions:  
   \(x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}\).  
3. Solve for both cases:  
   - \(x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\)  
   - \(x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)  

**Solution**: The roots are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A full day is 24 hours. A round trip consists of traveling from one city to the other and back, so the distance for one round trip is \(2 \times 200  \text{km} = 400  \text{km}\).

- **Time for one round trip**:  
  Time = Distance / Speed = \(400  \text{km} / 60  \text{km/h} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667  \text{hours}\).

- **Total time available**: 24 hours.  
- **Number of round trips**:  
  Divide total time by time per round trip:  
  \( \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6 \).  

Since the number of round trips must be a whole number (as partial trips do not count as complete round trips), we take the integer part. The train can complete 3 full round trips in 24 hours.

**Verification**:  
- Time for 3 round trips: \(3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20  \text{hours}\).  
- Remaining time: \(24 - 20 = 4  \text{hours}\).  
- In 4 hours, the train can travel \(4 \times 60 = 240  \text{km}\).  
- A one-way trip to the other city is 200 km, which takes \(\frac{200}{60} \approx 3.333  \text{hours}\). The train can reach the other city but not return (as the return trip also takes about 3.333 hours), so it cannot complete a fourth round trip.

**Answer**: The train can make 3 round trips within a full day. [end of text]
