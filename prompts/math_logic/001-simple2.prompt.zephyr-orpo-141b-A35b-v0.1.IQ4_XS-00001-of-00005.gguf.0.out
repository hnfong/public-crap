Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Q1: 120 is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller number. It is also the lowest number divisible by 1 through 5, and the smallest number to appear 6 times in the Pascal's triangle.

Q2: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
Factorize: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
Therefore, x = 9 or x = -2

Q3: To calculate this, we first need to find out how long it takes the train to travel between the two cities one way. We can use the formula distance = speed * time. So, time = distance / speed.

Time = 200km / 60km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate how many round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours).

Number of round trips = 24 hours / (2 * 3.33 hours) = 3.63 trips (approximately)

Since a train can't make a fraction of a trip, the train can make 3 round trips in a full day.</s>
