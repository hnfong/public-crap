Let me re-read this carefully and think through it step by step.

The statement says "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" - but this doesn't make sense as written. Let me consider what this might actually mean.

Actually, I think there might be a misunderstanding in the original statement. Let me think about what makes sense for remembering Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions:

The standard formula is: F = (9/5)C + 32

A common mnemonic is: "Multiply by 9, divide by 5, add 32"

But what about "inverted digits"? Let me check some common temperature conversions:

- 0°C = 32°F
- 10°C = 50°F  
- 20°C = 68°F
- 30°C = 86°F
- 40°C = 104°F

Looking at these, I notice that 10°C = 50°F, 20°C = 68°F, 30°C = 86°F, 40°C = 104°F.

Wait - let me reconsider what "inverted digits" could mean. 

Actually, I believe the intended meaning is likely: "Every 10°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted from the Celsius temperature."

But that's still not quite right. Let me think of the actual pattern that might be intended:

Looking more carefully at common conversions:
- 0°C = 32°F (0 and 32 don't have inverted digits)
- 10°C = 50°F (10 → 50, but 1 and 5 aren't inverted digits)
- 20°C = 68°F (2 and 6, 0 and 8 - not really inverted)

Actually, I think the statement is referring to a specific pattern that's not immediately obvious. Let me try a different approach.

The most likely intended meaning is that there's a pattern where every 12°C increment shows some digit relationship, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

The statement as written seems to be either:
1. Incorrectly worded, or
2. Referring to a very specific pattern I'm missing

The most reasonable interpretation is that it's trying to describe a pattern in the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit numbers, but the way it's phrased is confusing.

A much clearer way to remember the conversion would be to use the formula F = (9/5)C + 32, or memorize key points like 0°C = 32°F, 10°C = 50°F, 20°C = 68°F, etc.

The statement as written doesn't seem to accurately describe a useful pattern for conversion. [end of text]
