A1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons:
1. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
2. It is the factorial of 5 (5!), which means it is the product of all positive integers up to 5 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).
3. It is the sum of four consecutive primes (23 + 29 + 31 + 37 = 120).
4. It is the smallest number to have exactly 16 divisors.
5. In geometry, 120 is the measure of the interior angle of a regular pentagon.
6. In numerology, 120 is considered a powerful number, often associated with cycles and completion.

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)² - 4 * 1 * (-18))) / 2 * 1
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

The two solutions are:
x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To determine how many round trips the train can make between two cities within a full day, we first need to calculate the total travel time for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time taken for one-way travel is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours = 3 hours and 20 minutes

Since the train needs to return to the starting city, the round trip time is:
Round trip time = 2 * (3 hours and 20 minutes) = 6 hours and 40 minutes

Now, let's convert 6 hours and 40 minutes to hours:
6 hours + 40 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 6 + 2/3 = 20/3 hours

A full day has 24 hours. To find out how many round trips the train can make, we divide the total hours in a day by the round trip time:
Number of round trips = 24 hours / (20/3 hours) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
