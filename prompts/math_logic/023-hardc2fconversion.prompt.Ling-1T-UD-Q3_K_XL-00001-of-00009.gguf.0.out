The statement:

> "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

is **not accurate as a general rule**, but it may be referring to a rough coincidence or approximation that occurs at certain temperatures. Let's break it down carefully.

---

### What it *might* be trying to say:
At **some specific temperatures**, the numerical value in °C is approximately the reverse (digit inversion) of the °F value. For example:

- **16°C ≈ 61°F** → digits "16" and "61" are reversed.
- **28°C ≈ 82°F** → "28" and "82" are reversed.
- **12°C = 53.6°F** → not a digit reversal (12 vs 53.6), so this doesn't fit.

Wait — the claim says "every 12°C", which suggests a pattern repeating every 12 degrees, but that doesn't align with digit inversion.

So let's test the idea.

### Actual Celsius to Fahrenheit formula:
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Let’s compute a few values:

| °C  | °F (calculated) | Are digits inverted? |
|-----|------------------|------------------------|
| 0   | 32               | 0 vs 32? No            |
| 12  | (12×1.8)+32 = 53.6 | 12 vs 53.6? No (not digit reversal) |
| 24  | 75.2             | 24 vs 75.2? No         |
| 16  | 60.8 ≈ 61        | 16 → 61? Yes, digits reversed |
| 28  | 82.4 ≈ 82        | 28 → 82? Yes           |
| 32  | 89.6             | 32 vs 89.6? No         |

So **16°C ≈ 61°F** and **28°C ≈ 82°F** are close to digit reversals, but **12°C = 53.6°F**, which is **not** a digit reversal (12 → 21, not 53).

So the phrase "every 12°C" doesn't produce digit inversion.

### Likely Explanation:
The statement is **misleading or incorrect**, but it may be a **mnemonic based on a few coincidences**:

- 16°C ≈ 61°F → digits swapped
- 28°C ≈ 82°F → digits swapped
- 0°C = 32°F → not swapped, but 0 and 32 don't match

But 16 and 28 are **12 apart**, so maybe the person meant: *"At 16°C and 28°C (which are 12 apart), the digits invert"* — but that’s a stretch.

Alternatively, it could be a **misremembered version** of:
> "When the digits of °C are reversed, you get roughly °F, for some values like 16/61, 28/82."

But "every 12°C" doesn’t hold.

---

### Conclusion:
The statement **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is **not a valid or reliable rule**.

✅ **Correct interpretation**:  
At a few specific temperatures (like 16°C ≈ 61°F, 28°C ≈ 82°F), the Celsius and Fahrenheit values are rough digit reversals. But this is coincidence, not a pattern tied to "every 12°C".

❌ **Why it's misleading**:  
12°C → 53.6°F (not 21°F), so digits are not inverted.

---

### Example of the coincidence:
- **16°C** → (16 × 1.8) + 32 = 60.8°F ≈ **61°F** → "16" reversed is "61"
- **28°C** → 82.4°F ≈ **82°F** → "28" reversed is "82"

These are interesting coincidences, but **not a general rule**, and **not tied to intervals of 12°C**.

So the original statement is likely a **misguided mnemonic**.
