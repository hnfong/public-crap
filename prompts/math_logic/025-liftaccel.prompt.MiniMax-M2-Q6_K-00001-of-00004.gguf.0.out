### Solution

We assume the elevator moves vertically along a straight line, with constant acceleration (or deceleration) of magnitude \(a = 1\ \text{m/s}^2\) and a maximum speed \(v_{\max} = 5\ \text{m/s}\). The building has 40 floors, each 5 m tall, so the total height from ground (1/F) to top (40/F) is:
\[
H = 40 \times 5 = 200\ \text{m}.
\]

#### 1. Time to go from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)

We need to find the time \(T\) to travel a distance \(H = 200\ \text{m}\) under the given constraints.

**Step 1: Determine if the elevator reaches the maximum speed.**

The distance required to accelerate from rest to \(v_{\max}\) under constant acceleration \(a\) is:
\[
d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\max}^2}{2a} = \frac{5^2}{2 \times 1} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5\ \text{m}.
\]
Similarly, the distance required to decelerate from \(v_{\max}\) to rest is also \(d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5\ \text{m}\).

The total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration phases is:
\[
d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25\ \text{m}.
\]

Since \(H = 200\ \text{m} > 25\ \text{m}\), the elevator will reach the maximum speed and travel at constant speed for some time.

**Step 2: Calculate the time spent in each phase.**

- **Acceleration phase:**  
  Time to reach \(v_{\max}\):
  \[
  t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\max}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5\ \text{s}.
  \]

- **Deceleration phase:**  
  Time to stop from \(v_{\max}\):
  \[
  t_{\text{dec}} = \frac{v_{\max}}{a} = 5\ \text{s}.
  \]

- **Constant speed phase:**  
  The distance covered at constant speed is:
  \[
  d_{\text{cruise}} = H - (d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}}) = 200 - 25 = 175\ \text{m}.
  \]
  Time at constant speed:
  \[
  t_{\text{cruise}} = \frac{d_{\text{cruise}}}{v_{\max}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35\ \text{s}.
  \]

**Step 3: Total time:**
\[
T = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{cruise}} + t_{\text{dec}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45\ \text{s}.
\]

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{45\ \text{seconds}}
\]

#### 2. Time for two passengers: first to 10/F, second to 30/F

The elevator starts at 1/F, stops at 10/F (first passenger exits), then continues to 30/F (second passenger exits). We need the total time until the second passenger reaches 30/F.

**Step 1: Calculate distances.**

- From 1/F to 10/F:  
  Height = \(10 \times 5 = 50\ \text{m}\).

- From 10/F to 30/F:  
  Height = \((30 - 10) \times 5 = 20 \times 5 = 100\ \text{m}\).

**Step 2: Time for first leg (1/F → 10/F).**

- Distance \(H_1 = 50\ \text{m}\).  
- Check if max speed is reached:  
  \(d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}} = 25\ \text{m} < 50\ \text{m}\), so max speed is reached.

- **Acceleration phase:** \(t_{\text{acc}} = 5\ \text{s}\), \(d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5\ \text{m}\).  
- **Deceleration phase:** \(t_{\text{dec}} = 5\ \text{s}\), \(d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5\ \text{m}\).  
- **Cruise phase:**  
  \(d_{\text{cruise}} = 50 - 25 = 25\ \text{m}\),  
  \(t_{\text{cruise}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5\ \text{s}\).

- **Total time for first leg:**  
  \(T_1 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15\ \text{s}\).

**Step 3: Time for second leg (10/F → 30/F).**

- Distance \(H_2 = 100\ \text{m}\).  
- Check if max speed is reached:  
  \(d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}} = 25\ \text{m} < 100\ \text{m}\), so max speed is reached.

- **Acceleration phase:** \(t_{\text{acc}} = 5\ \text{s}\), \(d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5\ \text{m}\).  
- **Deceleration phase:** \(t_{\text{dec}} = 5\ \text{s}\), \(d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5\ \text{m}\).  
- **Cruise phase:**  
  \(d_{\text{cruise}} = 100 - 25 = 75\ \text{m}\),  
  \(t_{\text{cruise}} = \frac{75}{5} = 15\ \text{s}\).

- **Total time for second leg:**  
  \(T_2 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25\ \text{s}\).

**Step 4: Total time until second passenger reaches 30/F:**
\[
T = T_1 + T_2 = 15 + 25 = 40\ \text{s}.
\]

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{40\ \text{seconds}}
\]

#### 3. Minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop at another floor (not 40/F)

The elevator must stop at some floor \(k\) (where \(2 \leq k \leq 39\)) before reaching 40/F. We need to minimize the total time to reach 40/F, given that it stops at \(k\).

**Step 1: Define the problem.**

- The elevator travels from 1/F to \(k\) (stop), then from \(k\) to 40/F.  
- Let \(H_k\) be the height from 1/F to \(k\): \(H_k = 5k\ \text{m}\).  
- Let \(H_{40-k}\) be the height from \(k\) to 40/F: \(H_{40-k} = 5(40 - k)\ \text{m}\).  
- Total height: \(H = 200\ \text{m}\).

**Step 2: Time for each segment.**

For a segment of height \(H_i\), the time \(T_i\) is:
- If \(H_i \leq 25\ \text{m}\) (max speed not reached):  
  \(T_i = 2\sqrt{\frac{H_i}{a}} = 2\sqrt{H_i}\) (since \(a = 1\)).  
- If \(H_i > 25\ \text{m}\) (max speed reached):  
  \(T_i = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{dec}} + \frac{H_i - 25}{v_{\max}} = 5 + 5 + \frac{H_i - 25}{5} = 10 + \frac{H_i - 25}{5}\).

**Step 3: Total time as a function of \(k\).**

- **First segment (1/F → k):**  
  \(H_k = 5k\).  
  - If \(5k \leq 25\) (i.e., \(k \leq 5\)):  
    \(T_k = 2\sqrt{5k}\).  
  - If \(5k > 25\) (i.e., \(k > 5\)):  
    \(T_k
