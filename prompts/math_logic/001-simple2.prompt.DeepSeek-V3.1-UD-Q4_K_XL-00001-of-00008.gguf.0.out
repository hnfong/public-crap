Let's address each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 has several interesting properties across mathematics, science, and culture. Here are some key points:

1. **Mathematical Properties:**
   - 120 is a factorial number: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
   - It is a triangular number (the sum of the first 15 integers: 1+2+...+15=120).
   - It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors).
   - It is the smallest number to appear 6 times in Pascal's triangle.
   - It is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61).

2. **Science and Measurement:**
   - In geometry, 120 is the number of degrees in each internal angle of a regular hexagon.
   - In physics, 120 is used in the context of three-phase electric power systems (120 degrees phase difference).

3. **Cultural and Historical Significance:**
   - In the Bible, 120 is the age Moses died (Deuteronomy 34:7).
   - It is the number of years God gave humanity to repent before the flood (Genesis 6:3).
   - In some contexts, 120 is used to represent a long lifespan or a full measure.

4. **Other:**
   - 120 is the emergency telephone number in Turkey.
   - In photography, 120 is a film format for medium-format cameras.

**Steps:**
- Recall mathematical properties (factorial, triangular, composite).
- Consider scientific applications (angles, phases).
- Remember cultural references (Biblical, historical).
- Note miscellaneous uses (emergency number, film).

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**
To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use factoring.

**Steps:**
1. Look for two numbers that multiply to -18 (the constant term) and add to -7 (the coefficient of x).
   - The numbers are -9 and 2 because (-9) × 2 = -18 and (-9) + 2 = -7.
2. Factor the quadratic: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0\).
3. Set each factor equal to zero:
   - \(x - 9 = 0\) → \(x = 9\)
   - \(x + 2 = 0\) → \(x = -2\)
4. The solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

**Verification:**
- For x=9: \(9^2 - 7*9 - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0\)
- For x=-2: \((-2)^2 - 7*(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0\)

So, the roots are correct.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
A full day has 24 hours.

**Steps:**
1. The distance for one round trip (to and fro) is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) km.
2. The speed is 60 km/h, so the time for one round trip is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. The number of round trips in 24 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]
4. Since the train cannot make a fractional trip, it can complete 3 full round trips.

**Explanation:**
- After 3 trips, the time used is \(3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20\) hours.
- The remaining time is 4 hours, which is not enough for another full round trip (which requires 6.6667 hours).

Therefore, the train can make **3 round trips** in a full day.

**Final Answers:**
- Q1: 120 is significant as a factorial (5!), triangular number, highly composite number, and has cultural references (e.g., Biblical lifespan). 
- Q2: The solutions to \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).
- Q3: The train can make **3 round trips** in a full day. [end of text]
