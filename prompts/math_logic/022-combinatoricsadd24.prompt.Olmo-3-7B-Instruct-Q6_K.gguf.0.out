Let's systematically try combinations using only the numbers **4, 3, 1, 8** each used at most once (except as needed for operations), aiming for the result **24**.

---

### Attempt 1

Try simple multiplication and addition:

**8 × 3 = 24**, but we still have 4 and 1 left. If we just use 8×3, that's 24, but we're not using all numbers. The problem likely expects all numbers to be used (unless stated otherwise).

But let's see if we can combine all four numbers to get 24.

#### Option A: Use 8 × (3 + 1) = 8 × 4 = 32, then subtract 4 → 32 - 4 = 28 (not 24)

#### Option B: (8 × 3) - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19 (nope)

#### Option C: 8 × (4 - 3) + 1 = 8 × 1 + 1 = 9 (nope)

#### Option D: (8 + 4) × (3 - 1) = 12 × 2 = 24 ✅

Wait, that uses all numbers: 8, 4, 3, 1.

Let's double check:

(8 + 4) = 12  
(3 - 1) = 2  
12 × 2 = 24 ✔️

And all numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) are used exactly once (except as needed in operations).

### Double Checking

Expression: (8 + 4) × (3 - 1)  
Step 1: 8 + 4 = 12  
Step 2: 3 - 1 = 2  
Step 3: 12 × 2 = 24

Used numbers: 8, 4, 3, and 1 — all from the given set.

---

### Final Answer

**Attempt:** (8 + 4) × (3 - 1) = 12 × 2 = 24  
**Double checking:** 8 + 4 = 12; 3 - 1 = 2; 12 × 2 = 24. All numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) are used exactly once in the expression. ✅

**Final Expression:**  
\[
(8 + 4) \times (3 - 1) = 24
