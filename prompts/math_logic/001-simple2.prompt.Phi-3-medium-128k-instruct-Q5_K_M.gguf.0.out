Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

- It is an even number.
- It is a composite number, meaning it has more than two factors. Its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
- It is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
- It is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 is divisible by 3).
- It is the smallest number that is divisible by the numbers 1 to 5.
- It is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

So, the two solutions are:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

The solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. So, the time it takes to travel one way is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since a round trip involves going to the other city and coming back, the total time for one round trip is:

Round trip time = 2 * One-way time
Round trip time = 2 * 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours (approximately)

There are 24 hours in a day, so the number of round trips the train can make within a full day is:

Number of round trips = Total hours in a day / Round trip time
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.6 round trips

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips between the two cities within a full day.
