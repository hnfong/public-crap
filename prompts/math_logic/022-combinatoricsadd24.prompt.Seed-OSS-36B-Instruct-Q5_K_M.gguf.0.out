Got it, let's try to figure out how to make 24 with 4, 3, 1, 8. First, I remember that common ways to get 24 are things like 3×8, 4×6, 2×12, 24×1, or combinations of those. Let's list the numbers again: 4, 3, 1, 8. All distinct, need to use each once.

First thought: 3×8 is 24, so if we can use the 4 and 1 to make 1, then 3×8×1×4? Wait, no, 3×8 is 24, then what about 4 and 1? Maybe 3×8×(4 - 1)? 4-1 is 3, 3×8×3=72, too big. Or 8×(something with 4,3,1). Let's see, 8×3=24, then we have 4 and 1 left. 24 + 4 - 1=27, which was one of the wrong attempts. 24 - 4 + 1=21, nope. 24×(4-1)/something? Wait, 8×(3 + 1) is 32, 32 - 4=28, no. 8×(4 - 1) + 3=24 + 3=27, still 27.

What about 4×6? 6 could be 8 - (3 - 1)=6? 8 - 2=6, then 4×6=24, but we have to use all numbers. So 4×(8 - (3 - 1))=4×(8 - 2)=4×6=24. Let's check the numbers: 4,8,3,1. Yes, that's all four. Wait, does that work? Let's compute step by step: 3 - 1=2, 8 - 2=6, 4×6=24. That seems right. Let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. 4 is used, 8 is used, 3 is used, 1 is used. All once.

Another option: (8 - 1)×3 + 3? No, only one 3. Wait, (4 + 1)×3 + 9? No. What about 1×3×8×4=96, too big. Divide? Maybe 8×3×(4 - 1)/1, but that's 24×3=72. No. Wait, the first one I thought: 4×(8 - (3 - 1))=24. Let's verify again. 3-1 is 2, 8-2 is 6, 4×6 is 24. Numbers used: 4,3,1,8. Perfect. Is there another way? Maybe (8 - 3 + 1)×4? 8-3=5+1=6×4=24. Oh, that's simpler! 8 - 3 is 5, plus 1 is 6, times 4 is 24. Let's check that: (8 - 3 + 1)×4. Order of operations: 8-3=5, 5+1=6, 6×4=24. Numbers: 8,3,1,4. All used once. That's even better. Did I do that right? 8-3+1 is 6, 6×4=24. Yep. Or 4×(8 - 3 + 1), same thing.

Wait, let's make sure there are no mistakes. Let's take that attempt: 4×(8 - 3 + 1). Let's compute step by step: inside the parentheses first, 8 - 3 is 5, then 5 + 1 is 6, then 4×6 is 24. Numbers used: 4,8,3,1. All four numbers, each once. That works. Is there a reason that's not valid? The problem didn't say no parentheses, right? The examples used parentheses, so that's allowed. Let me check if I misread the numbers: 4,3,1,8. Correct. So that should be a valid one.</seed:think>Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * (5 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct. [end of text]
