"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement means that when you add the Celsius temperature to the Fahrenheit temperature, you divide the result by 12. This is because the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are based on the same underlying temperature scale (Kelvin). 

If you want to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can start by dividing the Celsius temperature by 12. The result is the Fahrenheit temperature. If you want to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you can add the Celsius temperature to 98.74. This is because the Celsius temperature and the Fahrenheit temperature are both based on the same scale, and adding the Celsius temperature to 98.74 gives you the Fahrenheit temperature.

Here are some examples of these conversions:

Celsius to Fahrenheit:
- If you have 100°C, then your Fahrenheit temperature is 86.82°F.
- If you have 12°C, the result is 212°F.

Fahrenheit to Celsius:
- If you have 212°F, then your Celsius temperature is 86.82°C.
- If you have 100°C, the result is 212°C.

This is a simple example, but it highlights the importance of understanding the underlying scale of temperature measurement.
