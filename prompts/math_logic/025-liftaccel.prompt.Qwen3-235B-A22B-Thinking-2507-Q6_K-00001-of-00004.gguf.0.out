Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. First, I need to understand the setup. The building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall, so total height from ground (1/F) to top (40/F) is 39 floors * 5 meters = 195 meters. Wait, because ground floor is 1/F, so going to 40/F means moving up 39 floors. Let me confirm: 40 floors total, so the distance between 1/F and 40/F is (40-1)*5 = 195 meters. Correct.

The elevator has acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s², max speed 5 m/s. So first, I need to figure out the motion profile: does it reach max speed, or does it accelerate and then decelerate without reaching max speed?

For question 1: time from 1/F to 40/F (195 meters).

First, calculate the distance needed to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate.

Acceleration phase: starts from rest, accelerates at 1 m/s² until reaching 5 m/s.

Time to reach max speed: v = a*t => t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds.

Distance during acceleration: s = 0.5*a*t² = 0.5*1*25 = 12.5 meters.

Same for deceleration: 12.5 meters, time 5 seconds.

So total distance for acceleration + deceleration: 25 meters.

Total distance needed is 195 meters, which is more than 25 meters, so there is a constant speed phase.

Distance at constant speed: 195 - 25 = 170 meters.

Time at constant speed: distance / speed = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds.

Total time: acceleration time + constant speed time + deceleration time = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds.

Wait, but let me check again. Wait, when going from 1/F to 40/F, the elevator starts at 1/F (ground), so initial velocity 0, accelerates up, then maybe constant speed, then decelerates to stop at 40/F.

Yes, so the motion is: accelerate until max speed (if possible), then constant speed, then decelerate to stop.

So the calculation above seems right. 12.5 m up during acceleration, 12.5 m during deceleration, so 25 m total for accel/decel. 195-25=170 m at 5 m/s, which takes 34 s. Total time 5+34+5=44 s. That seems correct.

Question 1 answer: 44 seconds.

Question 2: Two people, first to 10/F, second to 30/F. So the elevator goes from 1/F to 10/F, stops, then to 30/F.

Wait, but does it stop at 10/F? The problem says "two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F." So the elevator will stop at 10/F to let the first person out, then continue to 30/F.

So need to calculate time from 1/F to 10/F, then from 10/F to 30/F.

First, distance from 1/F to 10/F: (10-1)*5 = 45 meters.

Check if during this trip, the elevator reaches max speed.

Acceleration distance: 12.5 m (as before), deceleration distance: 12.5 m. Total 25 m. 45 m > 25 m, so yes, there is a constant speed phase.

Distance at constant speed: 45 - 25 = 20 m.

Time at constant speed: 20 /5 =4 s.

Time for 1/F to 10/F: 5 (accel) +4 (const) +5 (decel) =14 s.

Wait, but wait: when stopping at 10/F, the elevator has to decelerate to stop, so yes, the motion is accel to max speed, const, decel to stop.

Now, from 10/F to 30/F: distance is (30-10)*5=100 meters.

Again, check if reaches max speed.

Accel distance 12.5, decel 12.5, total 25. 100>25, so const speed phase.

Distance const: 100-25=75 m.

Time const:75/5=15 s.

Time for 10/F to 30/F:5+15+5=25 s.

But wait, does the elevator start from rest at 10/F? Yes, because it stopped there. So it accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s, then const, then decelerates to 0 at 30/F.

So total time is time to 10/F plus time from 10/F to 30/F:14 +25=39 seconds.

Wait, but need to confirm the distances.

1/F to 10/F: 9 floors *5=45 m. Correct.

10/F to 30/F:20 floors *5=100 m. Correct.

For 45 m:

Time to accelerate to 5 m/s:5 s, distance 12.5 m.

Then decelerate: needs 12.5 m to stop. So 45-25=20 m at 5 m/s, time 4 s. Total time 5+4+5=14 s. Correct.

For 100 m:

Same accel/decel distances. 100-25=75 m at 5 m/s:15 s. Total time 5+15+5=25 s. Correct.

Total time:14+25=39 s.

But wait, is there any time for the door opening/closing? The problem doesn't mention that, so we can assume instantaneous stops, no waiting time. So just the motion time.

So question 2 answer:39 seconds.

Question 3: Two people, first to 40/F, second to some other floor (not 40/F). The elevator must stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. Find the minimum time to reach 40/F.

So the elevator has to make at least one stop between 1/F and 40/F (since second person doesn't go to 40/F, so must stop at their floor). We need to find the stop that minimizes the total time to 40/F.

To minimize time, the stop should be as close as possible to the start or end, but need to check.

Wait, when you have a stop in the middle, the elevator has to accelerate to the first stop, stop, then accelerate again to the next part.

But maybe stopping at a floor very close to the start would add minimal time, or stopping near the end.

Wait, let's think. Suppose the elevator stops at floor X (2<=X<=39), then continues to 40/F.

Total time = time from 1/F to X/F + time from X/F to 40/F.

We need to find X that minimizes this total time.

But since the elevator has to stop at X, which involves decelerating to stop at X, then accelerating from X to 40/F.

To minimize total time, we need to minimize the sum of the two trip times.

Let’s denote D1 = distance from 1/F to X/F = (X-1)*5 meters.

D2 = distance from X/F to 40/F = (40 - X)*5 meters.

For each segment, the time depends on whether the segment distance is enough to reach max speed.

First, let's consider possible X.

Case 1: X is very close to 1/F, say X=2/F. Then D1=5 meters.

Check if D1 is enough to accelerate and decelerate.

The minimum distance to stop (accelerate then decelerate without reaching max speed) is when the elevator accelerates for time t, then decelerates for time t, coming to stop.

The maximum speed reached would be v = a*t.

Distance during acceleration: 0.5*a*t².

Distance during deceleration: same, since deceleration is same magnitude.

Total distance: a*t².

We have a=1 m/s², so total distance = t².

We need total distance D1 =5 m = t² => t=√5 ≈2.236 s.

Max speed reached: v =a*t=√5 ≈2.236 m/s, which is less than max speed 5 m/s, so no constant speed phase.

Time for D1: 2*t = 2*√5 ≈4.472 s.

Then, from X=2/F to 40/F: D2=(40-2)*5=38*5=190 meters.

Check if D2 allows reaching max speed.

Accel distance 12.5, decel 12.5, total 25. 190>25, so const speed phase.

D2_const =190-25=165 m.

Time const=165/5=33 s.

Time for D2:5+33+5=43 s.

Total time: ~4.472 +43≈47.472 s.

But original time without stops was 44 s, so this is longer.

Case 2: X is close to 40/F, say X=39/F.

D1=(39-1)*5=38*5=190 m (same as D2 above).

Time for D1: same as D2 in case 1:43 s.

D2=(40-39)*5=5 m.

Time for D2: same as D1 in case 1: ~4.472 s.

Total time:43 +4.472≈47.472 s, same as case 1.

Case 3: X somewhere in the middle. Let's say X=20/F.

D1=19*5=95 m.

Check D1: 95 m.

Accel distance 12.5, decel 12.5, total 25. 95>25, so const speed.

D1_const=95-25=70 m.

Time D1:5 +70/5 +5=5+14+5=24 s.

D2=20*5=100 m.

Time D2: same as question 2's second part:25 s.

Total time:24+25=49 s, which is more than 47.47 s.

Hmm, so stopping near the ends gives less added time.

Wait, but maybe there's a floor where the first segment doesn't require deceleration to stop, but no—the elevator has to stop at X, so it must decelerate to 0 at X.

Wait, another thought: if the stop is such that the elevator doesn't have to decelerate fully, but no—if it's stopping at X, it must come to rest there, so deceleration to 0.

Wait, but what if the elevator could do a "soft stop" without decelerating to zero, but the problem states "has to stop at another floor", so it must stop, i.e., velocity zero at that floor.

So, to minimize total time, we need the stop that adds the least time compared to the direct trip.

The direct trip time is 44 s.

When we add a stop, the total time is time to X + time from X to 40.

The question is, which X makes this sum minimal.

Let’s model the time for a general D (distance from start to stop):

If D <= 25 m (since 12.5+12.5=25), then the elevator accelerates for t1, then decelerates for t2, with t1=t2 because starts and ends at 0.

Wait, no: when moving distance D, starting and ending at 0, with acceleration a and deceleration a.

The maximum speed reached is v, then time to accelerate to v is t1 = v/a, distance s1 = 0.5*a*t1² = v²/(2a).

Time to decelerate from v to 0 is t2 = v/a, distance s2 = v²/(2a).

Total distance D = s1 + s2 = v²/a.

Thus, v = sqrt(a*D).

Total time T1 = t1 + t2 = 2*v/a = 2*sqrt(D/a).

Since a=1, T1=2*sqrt(D).

If D >25 m, then the elevator reaches max speed 5 m/s.

Time to accelerate:5 s, distance 12.5 m.

Time to decelerate:5 s, distance 12.5 m.

Constant speed distance: D -25.

Time at constant speed: (D -25)/5.

Total time T1=5 + (D-25)/5 +5 =10 + (D-25)/5 = (D-25)/5 +10.

Similarly for the second segment, distance D' =195 - D (since total distance 195 m).

Time T2 depends on D':

If D' <=25, T2=2*sqrt(D').

If D' >25, T2=10 + (D' -25)/5.

Total time T = T1 + T2.

We need to find D (which is (X-1)*5, X from 2 to 39, so D from 5 to 190) that minimizes T.

Let’s consider D <=25 and D' =195 - D.

Since D <=25, D' =195 - D >=170, which is >25, so T2=10 + (195 - D -25)/5 =10 + (170 - D)/5 =10 +34 - D/5=44 - D/5.

T1=2*sqrt(D).

So total T=2*sqrt(D) +44 - D/5.

To minimize T, take derivative with respect to D:

dT/dD = 2*(1/(2*sqrt(D))) -1/5 = 1/sqrt(D) -1/5.

Set to zero: 1/sqrt(D)=1/5 => sqrt(D)=5 => D=25.

So minimum in this interval (D<=25) occurs at D=25.

Check D=25:

T1=2*sqrt(25)=10 s.

T2=44 -25/5=44-5=39 s.

Total T=10+39=49 s.

But wait, when D=25, which is (X-1)*5=25 => X-1=5 => X=6/F.

Wait, but D=25 m is 5 floors (since each floor 5m), so from 1/F to 6/F is 5 floors *5m=25m.

Now, check if D>25.

If D>25, then T1=10 + (D-25)/5.

D' =195 - D.

If D' >25 (i.e., D <170), then T2=10 + (195 - D -25)/5=10 + (170 - D)/5=44 - D/5.

Total T= [10 + (D-25)/5] + [44 - D/5] =10 + D/5 -5 +44 -D/5= 49 s.

Wait, that's constant 49 s for 25 < D <170.

If D >=170, then D' =195 - D <=25.

So T1=10 + (D-25)/5.

T2=2*sqrt(D')=2*sqrt(195 - D).

Total T=10 + (D-25)/5 + 2*sqrt(195 - D).

Let’s set x=195 - D, so D=195 -x, where x<=25.

Then T=10 + (195 -x -25)/5 +2*sqrt(x)=10 + (170 -x)/5 +2*sqrt(x)=10 +34 -x/5 +2*sqrt(x)=44 -x/5 +2*sqrt(x).

Same as the first case but with x instead of D.

Derivative dT/dx= -1/5 + 2*(1/(2*sqrt(x)))= -1/5 +1/sqrt(x).

Set to zero: 1/sqrt(x)=1/5 => x=25.

So minimum at x=25, which is D=195-25=170.

T=44 -25/5 +2*sqrt(25)=44 -5 +10=49 s.

So for D>=170, the minimum T is 49 s at D=170.

Wait, so in the range D<=25, the minimum T is 49 s at D=25.

In the range 25<D<170, T is constant 49 s.

In the range D>=170, minimum T is 49 s at D=170.

Wait, that's interesting. So no matter where you stop between 25m and 170m (i.e., floors 6/F to 34/F, since 25m=5 floors (1/F to 6/F), 170m=34 floors (1/F to 35/F)), the total time is 49 s.

But when stopping closer than 25m (D<25), like D=5m (X=2/F), we had T≈4.472 +43≈47.472 s, which is less than 49 s. Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, when D=5m (X=2/F):

T1=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 s.

T2=44 -5/5=44 -1=43 s.

Total T≈47.472 s.

But according to the derivative, when D<25, the function T=2*sqrt(D) +44 -D/5 has its minimum at D=25, but wait, let's check the derivative again.

dT/dD=1/sqrt(D) -1/5.

For D<25, sqrt(D)<5, so 1/sqrt(D)>1/5, so dT/dD>0. Wait, no:

Wait, if D<25, sqrt(D)<5, so 1/sqrt(D) >1/5, so dT/dD= positive, meaning T is increasing as D increases in D<25.

Wait, that means the minimum in D<=25 is at the smallest D.

Wait, let's take D approaching 0: T=2*sqrt(0) +44 -0=44 s, but D can't be 0.

But D is at least 5m (X=2/F).

At D=5:

T=2*sqrt(5) +44 -5/5≈4.472 +44 -1=47.472 s.

At D=10:

T=2*sqrt(10)+44 -10/5≈6.324 +44 -2=48.324 s.

At D=20:

T=2*sqrt(20)+44 -20/5≈8.944 +44 -4=48.944 s.

At D=25:

T=10 +44 -5=49 s.

Ah, so as D increases from 5 to 25, T increases from ~47.47 to 49.

Similarly, for D>170 (i.e., X>35/F, since D=170m is 34 floors, so X=35/F):

D=170m: X=35/F (since (35-1)*5=170).

D=175m: X=36/F (35*5=175).

D=190m: X=39/F (38*5=190).

For D=190m (X=39/F):

T1= time from 1/F to 39/F: D=190m.

Since 190>25, T1=10 + (190-25)/5=10 +165/5=10+33=43 s.

T2= time from 39/F to 40/F: D'=5m.

T2=2*sqrt(5)≈4.472 s.

Total T≈43+4.472≈47.472 s.

Similarly, D=185m (X=38/F):

T1=10 + (185-25)/5=10 +160/5=10+32=42 s.

T2=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324 s.

Total≈42+6.324≈48.324 s.

D=180m (X=37/F):

T1=10 + (180-25)/5=10+155/5=10+31=41 s.

T2=2*sqrt(15)≈7.746 s.

Total≈41+7.746≈48.746 s.

D=175m (X=36/F):

T1=10 + (175-25)/5=10+150/5=10+30=40 s.

T2=2*sqrt(20)≈8.944 s.

Total≈40+8.944≈48.944 s.

D=170m (X=35/F):

T1=10 + (170-25)/5=10+145/5=10+29=39 s.

T2=2*sqrt(25)=10 s.

Total=39+10=49 s.

So the minimal time occurs when D is as small as possible (X=2/F) or as large as possible (X=39/F), giving T≈47.472 s.

But wait, the problem says "the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor", so the stop must be at some floor between 1/F and 40/F, i.e., 2/F to 39/F.

The minimal time would be when the stop is at the closest possible floor to the start or end, i.e., 2/F or 39/F.

But let's confirm with X=2/F:

Distance 1/F to 2/F:5m.

Time to go from 1/F to 2/F:

As calculated, since 5m <25m, the elevator accelerates for t, then decelerates for t, reaching max speed v= a*t.

Total distance: 0.5*a*t² + (v*t2 -0.5*a*t2²). But since it's symmetric (accel then decel to stop), t1=t2=t.

Distance during acceleration:0.5*1*t².

Distance during deceleration: same, because initial speed for deceleration is v=a*t, and deceleration is -1 m/s², so distance= v*t -0..5*a*t²= a*t*t -0.5*a*t²=0.5*a*t².

Total distance= a*t²=1*t²= t²=5 => t=√5≈2.236 s.

Total time=2*t≈4.472 s.

Then from 2/F to 40/F: distance=195-5=190m.

190m >25m, so time=5 (accel) + (190-25)/5 (const) +5 (decel)=5 +165/5 +5=5+33+5=43 s.

Total time≈4.472+43≈47.472 s.

Similarly for X=39/F, same time.

Is there a floor closer than 2/F? No, since 1/F is the start.

Now, the question is asking for the minimum time. So 47.472 s, but we need to express it exactly.

For D=5m (X=2/F):

Time1=2*sqrt(D/a)=2*sqrt(5/1)=2√5 s.

Time2= time for 190m.

190m: accel 12.5m (5s), decel 12.5m (5s), const 165m (33s). Total 43s.

Total time=2√5 +43 s.

But 2√5 is approximately 4.472, so total≈47.472 s.

But is there a stop that results in less time?

Wait, what if the elevator doesn't have to decelerate fully for the stop? No, because it has to stop at the floor, so velocity must be zero there.

Another thought: maybe the elevator can do a "fly-by" stop where it doesn't come to a complete stop, but the problem states "has to stop at another floor", which implies coming to rest.

So the minimal time is when the stop is at the nearest floor, 2/F or 39/F, giving total time 43 + 2√5 seconds.

But let's check if stopping at 2/F is allowed. The problem says "between 1/F and 40/F", so 2/F is between them.

Now, is 2√5 +43 the exact value?

Yes.

But let's compute 2√5:

√5≈2.23607, so 2√5≈4.47214.

43 +4.47214≈47.47214 s.

But the question says "minimum time", so we need to see if this is indeed the minimum.

Wait, let's check X=2/F and X=3/F.

X=3/F: D=10m.

Time1=2*sqrt(10)≈6.3246 s.

Time2=44 -10/5=44-2=42 s.

Total≈6.3246+42=48.3246 s, which is more than 47.47 s.

X=2/F is better.

Similarly, X=39/F same as X=2/F.

Is there a floor with D less than 5m? No, since each floor is 5m apart.

So the minimal time is when stopping at 2/F or 39/F, time=2√5 +43 seconds.

But let's confirm the calculation for D=5m:

Acceleration phase: starts at 0, accelerates at 1 m/s² until some time t1, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at 5m.

Let t be the time accelerating, then time decelerating is also t (since acceleration and deceleration magnitudes are equal, and starts/ends at 0).

Velocity at end of acceleration: v = a*t = t.

Distance during acceleration: 0.5*a*t² =0.5*t².

Distance during deceleration: v*t -0.5*a*t² = t*t -0.5*t²=0.5*t².

Total distance:0.5t² +0.5t² =t²=5 => t=√5.

Total time:2t=2√5. Correct.

Then from 2/F to 40/F:190m.

As before, 190m requires 5s accel (12.5m), 33s const (165m), 5s decel (12.5m). Total 43s.

Total time:2√5 +43≈47.472 s.

Is there any other stop that could be faster? For example, if the elevator could skip decelerating for the stop, but no—it must stop.

Another angle: maybe the elevator goes past the stop floor without stopping, but the problem states it has to stop at another floor, so it must stop.

Thus, the minimal time is 43 + 2√5 seconds.

But let's see if the problem expects an exact form or decimal.

The question says "show your steps", so probably exact form.

2√5 is approximately 4.472, so total time≈47.47 seconds.

But let's check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, when going from 1/F to 2/F (5m), the elevator accelerates and decelerates, but does it reach the maximum speed of 5 m/s?

Max speed during this trip is v =a*t=1*√5≈2.236 m/s, which is less than 5 m/s, so no issue with max speed.

Similarly, when going from 2/F to 40/F (190m), it does reach max speed 5 m/s, since 190>25m.

Yes.

Another check: total time without stops is 44s.

With a stop at 2/F, it's ~47.47s, which is 3.47s more.

Is there a way to have a stop that adds less time?

Suppose the elevator stops at a floor where the first segment is just enough to reach max speed, but no—stopping requires deceleration, so even if you go to max speed, you have to decelerate to stop, which takes time.

Wait, for example, stopping at X where D=25m (6/F):

Time1=10s (5s accel, 0s const, 5s decel).

Time2=44 -25/5=44-5=39s.

Total=49s, which is more than 47.47s.

So indeed, stopping closer adds less time.

Thus, the minimal time is when stopping at the nearest floor, 2/F or 39/F, with time 43 + 2√5 seconds.

But let's compute 2√5 +43:

2√5 ≈4.4721, so total≈47.4721 s.

The problem might expect an exact value, so 43 + 2√5 seconds, or approximately 47.47 s.

But let's see if there's a different approach.

Alternative approach for question 3:

The minimal added time occurs when the stop is as close as possible to the start or end, because the time to go a short distance with acceleration/deceleration is less than the time saved by not having to decelerate early.

Wait, no—the direct trip has no stops, so adding a stop always adds time, but we need the minimal added time.

The added time is (time to X + time from X to 40) - time direct.

Time direct=44s.

Added time= [T1 + T2] -44.

For X=2/F:

T1 + T2=2√5 +43.

Added time=2√5 +43 -44=2√5 -1≈4.472-1=3.472 s.

For X=6/F (D=25m):

T1 + T2=10 +39=49.

Added time=5 s.

So indeed, X=2/F has smaller added time.

Is there a mathematical way to confirm that the minimal added time is at the smallest D?

Yes, as we saw earlier, for D<=25, T=2√D +44 -D/5.

The derivative dT/dD=1/√D -1/5.

For D<25, 1/√D >1/5, so dT/dD>0, meaning T increases as D increases. Therefore, minimal T in D<=25 is at minimal D=5m.

Similarly, for D>=170, T=44 -x/5 +2√x (x=195-D), and derivative shows minimal T at maximal x=25 (i.e., minimal D=170), but since x<=25, minimal T in this region is at x=25 (D=170), but for x<25 (D>170), T decreases as x decreases (D increases), so minimal T at maximal D=190 (x=5).

Thus, the overall minimal T is at D=5 or D=190, giving T=2√5 +43.

Therefore, the answer to question 3 is 43 + 2√5 seconds, approximately 47.47 seconds.

But let's check units and calculations once more.

Question 1:

Total distance:39*5=195m.

Accel: v=at => t=5/1=5s. Distance=0.5*1*25=12.5m.

Decel same:12.5m, 5s.

Constant speed distance:195-25=170m. Time=170/5=34s.

Total time:5+34+5=44s. Correct.

Question 2:

1/F to10/F:9*5=45m.

45>25, so const speed distance=45-25=20m. Time=20/5=4s.

Total time:5+4+5=14s.

10/F to30/F:20*5=100m.

100>25, const distance=75m. Time=15s.

Total time:5+15+5=25s.

Total:14+25=39s. Correct.

Question3:

Stop at 2/F (5m):

Time1:2*sqrt(5/1)=2√5 s.

Time2:190m.

190m: accel 12.5m (5s), const 165m (33s), decel 12.5m (5s). Total 43s.

Total time:2√5 +43≈47.47s.

Yes.

So the answers are:

1. 44 seconds.

2. 39 seconds.

3. 43 + 2√5 seconds (approximately 47.47 seconds).

### **Question 1: Time from Ground Floor (1/F) to Top Floor (40/F)**

**Step 1: Total Distance Calculation**  
- The building has 40 floors, with each floor being 5 meters tall.  
- From ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F), the elevator travels $ (40 - 1) \times 5 = 195 $ meters.

**Step 2: Motion Profile Analysis**  
- **Acceleration Phase**:  
  - Acceleration $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, maximum speed $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $.  
  - Time to reach max speed: $ t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s} $.  
  - Distance covered during acceleration: $ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} $.  

- **Deceleration Phase**:  
  - Same as acceleration phase (symmetric motion).  
  - Distance covered during deceleration: $ 12.5 \, \text{m} $.  
  - Total distance for acceleration + deceleration: $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $.  

- **Constant Speed Phase**:  
  - Remaining distance: $ 195 - 25 = 170 \, \text{m} $.  
  - Time at constant speed: $ \frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{s} $.  

**Step 3: Total Time Calculation**  
- Total time = Acceleration time + Constant speed time + Deceleration time  
$$
T = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{seconds}
$$

### **Question 2: Two People — First to 10/F, Second to 30/F**

**Step 1: Distance from 1/F to 10/F**  
- Floors traveled: $ 10 - 1 = 9 $ floors.  
- Distance: $ 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{m} $.  

**Step 2: Motion Profile for 1/F → 10/F**  
- Acceleration and deceleration distances: $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $.  
- Constant speed distance: $ 45 - 25 = 20 \, \text{m} $.  
- Time at constant speed: $ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \, \text{s} $.  
- Total time: $ 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \, \text{s} $.  

**Step 3: Distance from 10/F to 30/F**  
- Floors traveled: $ 30 - 10 = 20 $ floors.  
- Distance: $ 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m} $.  

**Step 4: Motion Profile for 10/F → 30/F**  
- Acceleration and deceleration distances: $ 25 \, \text{m} $.  
- Constant speed distance: $ 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m} $.  
- Time at constant speed: $ \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{s} $.  
- Total time: $ 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s} $.  

**Step 5: Total Time**  
- Total time = Time from 1/F → 10/F + Time from 10/F → 30/F  
$$
T = 14 + 25 = 39 \, \text{seconds}
$$

### **Question 3: Minimum Time to Reach 40/F with One Stop Between 1/F and 40/F**

**Step 1: Objective**  
- The elevator must stop at one intermediate floor between 1/F and 40/F.  
- Goal: Minimize total time to reach 40/F.

**Step 2: Strategy**  
- To minimize time, the stop should be as close as possible to either the start or end of the journey.  
- Consider stopping at **2/F** (closest to ground floor) or **39/F** (closest to top floor).

**Step 3: Case — Stop at 2/F**  
- **Distance from 1/F to 2/F**: $ (2 - 1) \times 5 = 5
