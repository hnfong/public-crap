Let's solve each question step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- Building height: 40 floors
- Each floor is 5 meters tall → Total height = $ 40 \times 5 = 200 $ meters
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration = $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Maximum speed = $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

We need to calculate the time it takes for the elevator to go from 1/F to 40/F (200 meters), with acceleration and deceleration.

### Step 1: Time to reach maximum speed

The elevator accelerates at $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $ until it reaches $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $.

$$
v = u + at \Rightarrow 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \Rightarrow t = 5 \, \text{seconds}
$$

So, it takes **5 seconds** to accelerate to max speed.

### Step 2: Distance covered during acceleration

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
$$

Same distance is covered during deceleration (since it decelerates at the same rate).

So, total distance during acceleration and deceleration = $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{meters} $

### Step 3: Distance covered at constant speed

Total distance = 200 meters  
Distance at constant speed = $ 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{meters} $

Time at constant speed:

$$
t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds}
$$

### Step 4: Total time

- Acceleration time = 5 s  
- Constant speed time = 35 s  
- Deceleration time = 5 s  

$$
\text{Total time} = 5 + 35 + 5 = \boxed{45 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

We need to calculate the time it takes for the elevator to go from 1/F to 10/F, then to 30/F.

### Step 1: Distance from 1/F to 10/F

$$
(10 - 1) \times 5 = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{meters}
$$

### Step 2: Distance from 10/F to 30/F

$$
(30 - 10) \times 5 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters}
$$

### Step 3: Total distance

$$
45 + 100 = 145 \, \text{meters}
$$

Now, we need to calculate the time to travel 145 meters with acceleration and deceleration.

We will assume the elevator accelerates to max speed, travels at constant speed, and then decelerates.

Let’s find how long it takes to cover 145 meters.

We already know:

- Acceleration/deceleration time = 5 seconds each
- Distance during acceleration/deceleration = 12.5 meters each

So, total distance during acceleration and deceleration = 25 meters

Remaining distance at constant speed = $ 145 - 25 = 120 \, \text{meters} $

Time at constant speed:

$$
t = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \, \text{seconds}
$$

Total time:

- Acceleration = 5 s  
- Constant speed = 24 s  
- Deceleration = 5 s  

$$
\text{Total time} = 5 + 24 + 5 = \boxed{34 \, \text{seconds}}
$$

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

We are to find the **minimum time** to reach 40/F, **given that the elevator must stop at one other floor** between 1/F and 40/F.

Let’s assume the elevator stops at floor **x**, where $ 1 < x < 40 $, and then continues to 40/F.

We want to **minimize the total time**, so we need to **minimize the total distance** the elevator travels, including the stop.

Let’s define:

- Distance from 1/F to x/F = $ (x - 1) \times 5 $
- Distance from x/F to 40/F = $ (40 - x) \times 5 $

Total distance = $ (x - 1) \times 5 + (40 - x) \times 5 = 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{meters} $

So, the total distance is **always 195 meters**, regardless of where the elevator stops (as long as it stops at one floor in between).

So, the **minimum time** is the same as the time to travel 195 meters with acceleration and deceleration.

Let’s calculate that.

### Step 1: Distance during acceleration and deceleration = 25 meters (as before)

Remaining distance at constant speed = $ 195 - 25 = 170 \, \text{meters} $

Time at constant speed:

$$
t = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{seconds}
$$

Total time:

- Acceleration = 5 s  
- Constant speed = 34 s  
- Deceleration = 5 s  

$$
\text{Total time} = 5 + 34 + 5 = \boxed{44 \, \text{seconds}}
$$
