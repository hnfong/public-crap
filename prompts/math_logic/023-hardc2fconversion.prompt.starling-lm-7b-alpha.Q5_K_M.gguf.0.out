"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This means that if you have a temperature in Celsius, and you want to convert it to Fahrenheit, you can simply follow the pattern of every 12°C, the digits in the temperature will flip places. Here are some examples to illustrate this:

- If the temperature is 0°C, then it will be -32°F (-25.5556°F to be more accurate) because 0 becomes 30 and the C becomes F.
- If the temperature is 10°C, then it will be -5°F (-22.2222°F to be more accurate) because 10 becomes -16 and the C becomes F.
- If the temperature is 25°C, then it will be -13°F (-10.5556°F to be more accurate) because 25 becomes -5 and the C becomes F.
- If the temperature is 30°C, then it will be -1°F (-17.7778°F to be more accurate) because 30 becomes -16 and the C becomes F.

However, it's important to note that this pattern doesn't always hold true for all temperatures. For example, if the temperature is 40°C, it will convert to 104°F (not -24), and if the temperature is 50°C, it will convert to 122°F (not -38). This method is a general rule of thumb, but not an exact mathematical formula.

If you want to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, it's generally easier to use the formula `(°C * 9/5) + 32 = °F`, or you can use a calculator or converter tool that specifically handles Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions.
