Here are the answers and steps for your questions:

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 is historically and mathematically significant. It is known as a "highly composite number" because it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Historically, it was the basis of many counting systems, including the Sexagesimal (base 60) system used by ancient Sumerians and Babylonians (which is why we still have 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle). It is also the number of members in the ancient Israeli Sanhedrin court and the age at which Moses died.

**Interesting Properties:**
1.  **Factorial:** It is the factorial of 5 ($5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$).
2.  **Divisors:** It has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120).
3.  **Sum of Primes:** It is the sum of four consecutive prime numbers ($23 + 29 + 31 + 37 = 120$).
4.  **Sum of Factorials:** It is the sum of the first four factorials ($1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, wait, $1!+2!+3!+4!+5! = 153$. Let me recheck. Actually, $1!+2!+3!+4! = 33$. However, $5! = 120$. A better property is that it is the sum of a twin prime pair ($59 + 61 = 120$)).
5.  **Geometry:** The internal angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**
The solutions are $x = 9$ and $x = -2$.

**Steps:**
1.  **Identify the coefficients:** The quadratic equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
    *   $a = 1$
    *   $b = -7$
    *   $c = -18$
2.  **Factor the equation:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to $c$ (-18) and add up to $b$ (-7).
    *   The factors of -18 are: (-1, 18), (1, -18), (-2, 9), (2, -9), (-3, 6), (3, -6).
    *   The pair that adds up to -7 is **2** and **-9** ($2 + (-9) = -7$ and $2 \times -9 = -18$).
3.  **Rewrite the equation:**
    $$(x + 2)(x - 9) = 0$$
4.  **Solve for x:** Set each factor equal to zero.
    *   $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$
    *   $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
The train can make **3** complete round trips within a full day.

**Steps:**
1.  **Calculate the distance of one round trip:**
    A round trip involves going from City A to City B and returning to City A.
    $$\text{Distance} = 200\text{ km} + 200\text{ km} = 400\text{ km}$$
2.  **Calculate the time required for one round trip:**
    $$\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$$
    $$\text{Time} = \frac{400\text{ km}}{60\text{ km/h}}$$
    $$\text{Time} = 6.666... \text{ hours} \text{ (or } 6 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes)}$$
3.  **Calculate the total time available:**
    A full day is 24 hours.
4.  **Determine the number of trips:**
    Divide the total time available by the time per trip.
    $$\text{Number of trips} = \frac{24\text{ hours}}{6.666... \text{ hours}}$$
    $$\text{Number of trips} = 3.6$$
5.  **Conclusion:**
    Since the train cannot complete 0.6 of a round trip (as a "trip" implies a full return), we take the whole number. The train completes 3 full round trips (taking 20 hours) and has 4 hours remaining, which is not enough to finish a 4th trip. [end of text]
