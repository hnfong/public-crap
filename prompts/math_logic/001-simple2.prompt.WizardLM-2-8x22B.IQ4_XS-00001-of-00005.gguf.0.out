 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, written as 5!, which means it is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 5 (1x2x3x4x5 = 120).

2. **Highly Composite Number**: It is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller number. Specifically, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

3. **Abundant Number**: 120 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 168) is greater than itself.

4. **Divisibility**: It is divisible by all single-digit numbers except 7.

5. **Sum of Prime Pairs**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of a pair of twin primes (59 + 61) and also as the sum of four consecutive primes (29 + 31 + 37 + 41).

6. **Refactorable Number**: The number of divisors of 120 is itself a divisor of 120 (16 divides 120).

7. **Pentagonal Number**: It is a pentagonal number, which means it can be represented in the form of a pentagon. Specifically, it is the 7th pentagonal number.

8. **Harshad Number**: 120 is a Harshad number in base 10, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0 = 3).

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the factoring method or the quadratic formula. I'll use factoring here:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be factored into (x - a)(x - b) = 0, where a and b are the roots of the equation. We need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7.

Those numbers are -9 and +2. So we can write the equation as:

(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Now, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips a train can make between two cities 200 km apart at an average speed of 60 km/h, we first need to determine the time it takes for a one-way trip:

Time for one-way trip = Distance / Speed
Time for one-way trip = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.333 hours (approximately)

Since a round trip is twice the distance, it will take twice the time:

Time for a round trip = 2 * 3.333 hours = 6.666 hours (approximately)

Now, we need to determine how many round trips can be made in a full day (24 hours):

Number of round trips per day = Total time available / Time for a round trip
Number of round trips per day = 24 hours / 6.666 hours â‰ˆ 3.6 round trips

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day. [end of text]
