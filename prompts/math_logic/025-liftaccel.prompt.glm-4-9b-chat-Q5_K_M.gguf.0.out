Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To solve these problems, we need to consider the acceleration, maximum speed, and the distance traveled by the elevator. Let's go through each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time from ground floor to top floor

1. **Distance**: The building has 40 floors, and each floor is 5 meters tall. So, the total distance is \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters.
2. **Acceleration**: The elevator accelerates at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and decelerates at the same rate.
3. **Maximum Speed**: The maximum speed is \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \).

First, we calculate the time to reach maximum speed and then the time to decelerate to a stop.

- **Time to reach max speed**: \( t_1 = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \) seconds.
- **Distance covered during acceleration**: \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \) meters.
- **Remaining distance**: \( 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 \) meters.
- **Time to cover remaining distance at max speed**: \( t_2 = \frac{s_2}{v} = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5 \) seconds.
- **Time to decelerate**: \( t_3 = t_1 = 5 \) seconds.

Total time: \( t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 37.5 + 5 = 47.5 \) seconds.

### Question 2: Two people at 10/F and 30/F

1. **First person (10/F)**:
   - **Distance**: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) meters.
   - **Time to reach max speed**: \( t_1 = 5 \) seconds.
   - **Distance covered during acceleration**: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) meters.
   - **Remaining distance**: \( 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \) meters.
   - **Time to cover remaining distance at max speed**: \( t_2 = \frac{37.5}{5} = 7.5 \) seconds.
   - **Time to decelerate**: \( t_3 = 5 \) seconds.
   - **Total time**: \( t_{\text{10/F}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 7.5 + 5 = 17.5 \) seconds.

2. **Second person (30/F)**:
   - **Distance**: \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \) meters.
   - **Time to reach max speed**: \( t_1 = 5 \) seconds.
   - **Distance covered during acceleration**: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) meters.
   - **Remaining distance**: \( 150 - 12.5 = 137.5 \) meters.
   - **Time to cover remaining distance at max speed**: \( t_2 = \frac{137.5}{5} = 27.5 \) seconds.
   - **Time to decelerate**: \( t_3 = 5 \) seconds.
   - **Total time**: \( t_{\text{30/F}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 27.5 + 5 = 37.5 \) seconds.

Since both people start at the same time, the total time taken is the time taken by the person who takes longer, which is \( 37.5 \) seconds.

### Question 3: Minimum time to 40/F with stops

1. **Assumption**: The elevator stops at least once between 1/F and 40/F.
2. **Optimal scenario**: The elevator stops at the half-way point (20/F) and then goes directly to 40/F.

- **Distance to 20/F**: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) meters.
- **Time to reach max speed**: \( t_1 = 5 \) seconds.
- **Distance covered during acceleration**: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) meters.
- **Remaining distance**: \( 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \) meters.
- **Time to cover remaining distance at max speed**: \( t_2 = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \) seconds.
- **Time to decelerate**: \( t_3 = 5 \) seconds.
- **Total time to 20/F**: \( t_{\text{20/F}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 \) seconds.

- **Distance from 20/F to 40/F**: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) meters.
- **Time to reach max speed**: \( t_1 = 5 \) seconds.
- **Distance covered during acceleration**: \( s_1 = 12.5 \) meters.
- **Remaining distance**: \( 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \) meters.
- **Time to cover remaining distance at max speed**: \( t_2 = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \) seconds.
- **Time to decelerate**: \( t_3 = 5 \) seconds.
- **Total time from 20/F to 40/F**: \( t_{\text{20/F to 40/F}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 \) seconds.

Total minimum time: \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{20/F}} + t_{\text{20/F to 40/F}} = 27.5 + 27.5 = 55 \) seconds.
