To solve these questions, we need to consider the acceleration, maximum speed, and the distance traveled. Let's break down each question step by step.

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

First, we need to calculate the total distance traveled. Since the building has 40 floors and each floor is 5 meters tall, the total distance is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

The elevator accelerates to its maximum speed, then travels at that speed, and finally decelerates to a stop. We can use the kinematic equations to calculate the time taken for each phase.

Let \( v_{\text{max}} \) be the maximum speed (5 m/s), \( a \) be the acceleration (1 m/sÂ²), and \( t \) be the time taken.

For the acceleration phase:
\[ v_{\text{max}} = a \cdot t_1 \]
\[ t_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

The distance covered during acceleration is:
\[ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \cdot (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

For the deceleration phase, the distance covered is the same as the acceleration phase, so:
\[ d_2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

The distance covered at maximum speed is:
\[ d_3 = \text{Total distance} - d_1 - d_2 = 200 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters} \]

The time taken at maximum speed is:
\[ t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

The total time taken is the sum of the times for acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration:
\[ \text{Total time} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 \]
\[ t_2 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ seconds} + 35 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?
\[ \text{Total time} = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

For the first person going to 10/F:
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \]

For the second person going to 30/F:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 150 \text{ meters} \]

We will calculate the time taken for each person separately and then add them together.

For the first person:
\[ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 \]
\[ 50 \text{ meters} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \cdot t_1^2 \]
\[ t_1^2 = 100 \text{ seconds}^2 \]
\[ t_1 = 10 \text{ seconds} \]

The distance covered at maximum speed is:
\[ d_3 = 50 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \]

The time taken at maximum speed is:
\[ t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{25 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

The total time taken for the first person is:
\[ \text{Total time for first person} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 \]
\[ t_2 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Total time for first person} = 10 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second person:
\[ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 \]
\[ 150 \text{ meters} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \cdot t_1^2 \]
\[ t_1^2 = 300 \text{ seconds}^2 \]
\[ t_1 = \sqrt{300} \text{ seconds} \approx 17.32 \text{ seconds} \]

The distance covered at maximum speed is:
\[ d_3 = 150 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 125 \text{ meters} \]

The time taken at maximum speed is:
\[ t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{125 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 25 \text{ seconds} \]

The total time taken for the second person is:
\[ \text{Total time for second person} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 \]
\[ t_2 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Total time for second person} = 17.32 \text{ seconds} + 25 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} \approx 47.32 \text{ seconds} \]

2. How long does it take for two people to get from the ground floor to their respective floors?
\[ \text{Total time for first person} + \text{Total time for second person} \approx 20 \text{ seconds} + 47.32 \text{ seconds} \approx 67.32 \text{ seconds} \]

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

For the first person going to 40/F:
\[ \text{Distance} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \]

We will calculate the time taken for the first person separately.

For the first person:
\[ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 \]
\[ 200 \text{ meters} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \cdot t_1^2 \]
\[ t_1^2 = 400 \text{ seconds}^2 \]
\[ t_1 = \sqrt{400} \text{ seconds} \approx 20 \text{ seconds} \]

The distance covered at maximum speed is:
\[ d_3 = 200 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters} \]

The time taken at maximum speed is:
\[ t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{
