I'll do my best to provide the answers to each question.

Q1: 1+1=2

Q2: 6*7=42

Q3: 83*59=4887

Q4: 349*683=239,557

Q5: 6043*7489=452,911,497

Q6: 3x + 7 = 22
To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides:
3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 15/3
x = 5

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: You give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, which is 40 dollars. The book costs 15 dollars, so the change due is 40 - 15 = 25 dollars. You give her an additional 5 dollar bill, so the final change she should give you is 25 - 5 = 20 dollars.

Q9: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so her mother has 2 + 1 = 3 children.

Q11: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
To solve this expression, follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):
1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 ÷ 4 = 3
2. Add 3 and 3: 3 + 3 = 6
3. Subtract 1 from 6: 6 - 1 = 5

Q12: 5 guests have arrived, and each guest needs one slice of cake. So, 5 slices of cake are needed.

Q13: The original price of the shirt is $25, and it's on sale for 20% off. To find the sale price, calculate 20% of $25:
20% of $25 = 0.20 * $25 = $5
Subtract $5 from the original price: $25 - $5 = $20

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes. Convert the hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Add the 45 minutes: 120 + 45 = 165 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, divide 165 by 60: 165 ÷ 60 = 2 hours and 45 minutes
Since the clock shows 3:45 PM, subtract 2 hours and 45 minutes from 6:30 PM: 6:30 PM - 2 hours = 4:30 PM
4:30 PM - 45 minutes = 4:00 PM

Q15: To find the number of taxis needed, divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi:
22 people ÷ 4 passengers/taxi = 5.5 taxis
Since you can't have a fraction of a taxi, you need 6 taxis.

Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's add the two known angles:
31 + 62 = 93 degrees
Subtract 93 from 180: 180 - 93 = 87 degrees
