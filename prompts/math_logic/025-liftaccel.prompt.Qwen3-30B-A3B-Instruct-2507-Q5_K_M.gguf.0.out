Let's solve each part step by step. We are given:

- Building: 40 floors  
- Floor height: 5 meters per floor  
- Total height: $ 40 \times 5 = 200 $ meters  
- Acceleration/deceleration: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $  
- Maximum speed: $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $

We assume:
- The elevator accelerates at $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $ until it reaches $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates at $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $ to stop.
- All motion is vertical, and we ignore any time for doors opening/closing unless specified (but in this case, we assume the stops are instantaneous except for the time to accelerate/decelerate).

---

### **Part 1: Time to go from 1/F to 40/F (200 m)**

We need to find the total time to travel 200 meters with:
- $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $

#### Step 1: Time and distance to accelerate to max speed

From rest to $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $ with $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $:

$$
t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
$$

Distance during acceleration:

$$
d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}
$$

Same for deceleration (from 5 m/s to 0):

$$
t_{\text{dec}} = 5 \, \text{s}, \quad d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m}
$$

So total distance for acceleration and deceleration:  
$$
d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}
$$

Remaining distance at constant speed:

$$
d_{\text{const}} = 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m}
$$

Time at constant speed:

$$
t_{\text{const}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s}
$$

#### Total time:

$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{dec}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = \boxed{45} \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ **Answer 1: 45 seconds**

### **Part 2: Two people: 1st to 10/F, 2nd to 30/F**

- 10/F: $ 10 \times 5 = 50 $ meters  
- 30/F: $ 30 \times 5 = 150 $ meters

The elevator starts at 1/F, goes up, stops at 10/F (first person exits), then continues to 30/F (second person exits).

We need to compute **total time from start to when the second person exits** (i.e., when the elevator reaches 30/F), **but** we must account for the stop at 10/F.

But the question is: **How long does it take?** — meaning from when they get on at 1/F until the second person gets off at 30/F.

We assume:
- The elevator accelerates, travels, decelerates to stop at 10/F.
- Then it starts again from rest to go to 30/F.
- We assume **no time delay** at the stop (i.e., the elevator immediately starts accelerating again after stopping). This is typical in such problems unless specified otherwise.

So we break the journey into two segments:

---

#### **Segment 1: 1/F → 10/F (50 m)**

Check if max speed is reached.

- Acceleration phase: $ t = 5 \, \text{s}, d = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- Deceleration phase: $ t = 5 \, \text{s}, d = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- Total for accel + decel: 25 m

But we only need to go 50 m — which is **more than 25 m**, so yes, the elevator **does reach max speed**.

So:
- Distance for acceleration: 12.5 m
- Distance for deceleration: 12.5 m
- Remaining distance: $ 50 - 25 = 25 $ m at 5 m/s

Time at constant speed: $ 25 / 5 = 5 $ s

So time to 10/F:

$$
t_1 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s}
$$

Now, the elevator stops at 10/F. We assume it **immediately starts again** (no waiting time).

---

#### **Segment 2: 10/F → 30/F (100 m)**

Now the elevator must go 100 meters from 10/F to 30/F.

Again, check if max speed is reached.

- Acceleration: 12.5 m
- Deceleration: 12.5 m
- Total for accel + decel: 25 m
- Remaining: $ 100 - 25 = 75 $ m at 5 m/s

Time at constant speed: $ 75 / 5 = 15 $ s

So time for this segment:

$$
t_2 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s}
$$

---

#### Total time:

$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = 15 + 25 = \boxed{40} \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ **Answer 2: 40 seconds**

---

### **Part 3: One person to 40/F (200 m), but must stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. What is the minimum time to reach 40/F?**

We are to **minimize** the total time to reach 40/F, **but** the elevator **must stop at one other floor** (not 40/F) between 1/F and 40/F.

So the elevator:
- Starts at 1/F
- Goes up to some floor $ x $ (between 2/F and 39/F), stops (for a moment), then continues to 40/F.

We want to **minimize total time** to reach 40/F.

We assume:
- The stop at floor $ x $ takes **zero time** (no waiting, just a stop to "stop" — but the elevator must decelerate to stop, then accelerate again).
- The elevator **must stop** at floor $ x $, so it must decelerate to 0 at floor $ x $, then accelerate again to go to 40/F.

So the total journey is:
1. 1/F → $ x $: accelerate, possibly constant speed, decelerate to stop at $ x $
2. $ x $ → 40/F: accelerate from rest, possibly constant speed, decelerate to stop at 40/F

We want to **minimize total time**, so we need to choose the **optimal floor $ x $** to stop at.

Let’s define:
- $ d_1 = $ distance from 1/F to $ x $: $ d_1 = 5x $ meters
- $ d_2 = $ distance from $ x $ to 40/F: $ d_2 = 5(40 - x) = 200 - 5x $ meters

We need to compute the time to go from 1/F to $ x $, then from $ x $ to 40/F, with the constraint that the elevator stops at $ x $.

We want to **minimize** total time $ T(x) = T_1(x) + T_2(x) $

Let’s analyze the time function for a given distance $ d $, with acceleration/deceleration $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, max speed $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $

Let $ T(d) $ be the time to travel distance $ d $ with:
- Accelerate at 1 m/s² to 5 m/s (takes 5 s, 12.5 m)
- Decelerate at 1 m/s² from 5 m/s to 0 (5 s, 12.5 m)
- So if $ d < 25 $ m, the elevator never reaches max speed — it accelerates partway, then decelerates.

So define $ T(d) $:

- If $ d \leq 25 $: no constant speed phase
  - Time: $ t = 2 \times \sqrt{2d / a} $? Wait — better to derive.

Actually, for motion with symmetric acceleration and deceleration (same magnitude), and no constant speed phase, the total time to go distance $ d $ with $ a = 1 $, and max speed $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 $, but if $ d < 25 $, then max speed is not reached.

Let’s derive the time for a distance $ d $, with acceleration $ a = 1 $, deceleration $ a = 1 $, and **no constant speed phase**.

Let $ t $ be the time to accelerate to some speed $ v $, then decelerate to 0.

Since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, the time to accelerate and decelerate are equal: $ t_1 = t_2 = t $

Then:
- Distance during acceleration: $ d_1 = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} t^2 $
- Distance during deceleration: $ d_2 = v t - \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = (a t) t - \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = a t^2 - \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $
- So total distance: $ d = d_1 + d_2 = a t^2 $

Since $ a = 1 $, $ d = t^2 $ → $ t = \sqrt{d} $

Total time: $ T = 2t = 2\sqrt{d} $

But this is only valid if the maximum speed reached $ v = a t = \sqrt{d} \leq 5 $

So:
- If $ d \leq 25 $, then $ \sqrt{d} \leq 5 $, so max speed not reached → $ T(d) = 2\sqrt{d} $
- If $ d > 25 $, then max speed **is** reached → time is:
  - $ t_{\text{acc}} = 5 $ s, $ d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5 $ m
  - $ t_{\text{dec}} = 5 $ s, $ d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 $ m
  - Constant speed distance: $ d - 25 $
  - Time at constant speed: $ (d - 25)/5 $
  - Total time: $ 5 + (d - 25)/5 + 5 = 10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} = \frac{d}{5} + 5 $

So summary:

$$
T(d) =
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{d}, & \text{if } d \leq 25 \\
\frac{d}{5} + 5, & \text{if } d > 25
\end{cases}
$$

Now, back to our problem.

We have:
- $ d_1 = 5x $ (from 1/F to $ x $)
- $ d_2 = 5(40 - x) = 200 - 5x $ (from $ x $ to 40/F)

Total time:
$$
T(x) = T(d_1) + T(d_2)
$$

We want to minimize $ T(x) $ for $ x = 2, 3, \dots, 39 $ (integer floors), but since the function is continuous, we can treat $ x $ as real and then check nearby integers.

Let’s define $ d_1 = 5x $, $ d_2 = 200 - 5x $

We need to consider different cases based on whether $ d_1 \leq 25 $ or $ > 25 $, and same for $ d_2 $.

Note:
- $ d_1 = 5x \leq 25 $ → $ x \leq 5 $
- $ d_2 = 200 - 5x \leq 25 $ → $ 200 - 5x \leq 25 $ → $ 5x \geq 175 $ → $ x \geq 35 $

So:
- If $ x \leq 5 $: $ d_1 \leq 25 $, $ d_2 > 25 $
- If $ 5 < x < 35 $: $ d_1 > 25 $, $ d_2 > 25 $
- If $ x \geq 35 $: $ d_1 > 25 $, $ d_2 \leq 25 $

Let’s analyze each region.

---

#### **Case 1: $ x \leq 5 $** → $ d_1 \leq 25 $, $ d_2 > 25 $

Then:
- $ T(d_1) = 2\sqrt{5x} $
- $ T(d_2) = \frac{200 - 5x}{5} + 5 = 40 - x + 5 = 45 - x $

So:
$$
T(x) = 2\sqrt{5x} + 45 - x
$$

Let’s minimize this for $ x \in (0, 5] $

Let $ f(x) = 2\sqrt{5x} - x + 45 $

Take derivative:
$$
f'(x) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot x^{-1/2} - 1 = \sqrt{5} / \sqrt{x} - 1
$$

Set $ f'(x) = 0 $:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{x}} = 1 \Rightarrow \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{5} \Rightarrow x = 5
$$

So minimum at $ x = 5 $ (endpoint)

At $ x = 5 $:
- $ d_1 = 25 $ m → $ T(d_1) = 2\sqrt{25} = 2 \times 5 = 10 $ s
- $ d_2 = 175 $ m → $ T(d_2) = 175/5 + 5 = 35 + 5 = 40 $ s
- Total: $ 10 + 40 = 50 $ s

---

#### **Case 2: $ x \geq 35 $** → $ d_1 > 25 $, $ d_2 \leq 25 $

Then:
- $ T(d_1) = \frac{5x}{5} + 5 = x + 5 $
- $ T(d_2) = 2\sqrt{200 - 5x} $

So:
$$
T(x) = x + 5 + 2\sqrt{200 - 5x}
$$

Let $ g(x) = x + 2\sqrt{200 - 5x} + 5 $

Derivative:
$$
g'(x) = 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} (200 - 5x)^{-1/2} \cdot (-5) = 1 - \frac{5}{\sqrt{200 - 5x}}
$$

Set $ g'(x) = 0 $:
$$
1 = \frac{5}{\sqrt{200 - 5x}} \Rightarrow \sqrt{200 - 5x} = 5 \Rightarrow 200 - 5x = 25 \Rightarrow 5x = 175 \Rightarrow x = 35
$$

So minimum at $ x = 35 $

At $ x = 35 $:
- $ d_1 = 175 $ m → $ T(d_1) = 175/5 + 5 = 35 + 5 = 40 $ s
- $ d_2 = 25 $ m → $ T(d_2) = 2\sqrt{25} = 10 $ s
- Total: $ 40 + 10 = 50 $ s

Same as before.

---

#### **Case 3: $ 5 < x < 35 $** → both $ d_1 > 25 $, $ d_2 > 25 $

Then:
- $ T(d_1) = \frac{5x}{5} + 5 = x + 5 $
- $ T(d_2) = \frac{200 - 5x}{5} + 5 = 40 - x + 5 = 45 - x $

So:
$$
T(x) = (x + 5) + (45 - x) = 50 \, \text{seconds}
$$

**Constant!**

So for **all** $ x \in (5, 35) $, total time is **exactly 50 seconds**

This is interesting.

So:
- For $ x \leq 5 $: minimum at $ x = 5 $ → 50 s
- For $ x \geq 35 $: minimum at $ x = 35 $ → 50 s
- For $ 5 < x < 35 $: always 50 s

So **minimum time is 50 seconds**, and it is **achieved for any $ x \in [5, 35] $** (inclusive)

But the question says: **"the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F"**

So $ x \neq 40 $, but $ x $ can be any floor from 2/F to 39/F.

So we can choose $ x = 10 $, for example, and get 50 s.

But wait — is this **minimum**?

But in **Part 1**, without stopping, it took **45 seconds**.

Now, with a mandatory stop, the **minimum time is 50 seconds**, which is **longer** — makes sense.

But is 50 seconds the **minimum possible** under the constraint?

Yes — because in the middle region, it's **exactly 50 seconds**, and at the edges it's 50 seconds, and outside it's more.

So **minimum time is 50 seconds**

But wait — is there a way to do better?

Wait — in the middle region, $ T(x) = 50 $, constant.

But is that correct?

Let’s test with $ x = 10 $:

- $ d_1 = 50 $ m → $ T(d_1) = 50/5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 $ s
- $ d_2 = 150 $ m → $ T(d_2) = 150/5 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 $ s
- Total: $ 15 + 35 = 50 $ s ✅

Now $ x = 20 $:

- $ d_1 = 100 $ m → $ T = 100/5 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 $ s
- $ d_2 = 100 $ m → $ T = 100/5 + 5 = 25 $ s
- Total: 50 s ✅

Now $ x = 30 $:

- $ d_1 = 150 $ → $ T = 30 + 5 = 35 $ s
- $ d_2 = 50 $ → $ T = 10 + 5 = 15 $ s
- Total: 50 s ✅

So yes, **for any $ x \in (5, 35) $, total time is 50 s**

Now, what if $ x = 6 $? (just above 5)

- $ d_1 = 30 $ m → $ T = 30/5 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 $ s
- $ d_2 = 170 $ m → $ T = 170/5 + 5 = 34 + 5 = 39 $ s
- Total: 11 + 39 = 50 s ✅

Similarly, $ x = 34 $:

- $ d_1 = 170 $ → $ T = 34 + 5 = 39 $ s
- $ d_2 = 30 $ → $ T = 6 + 5 = 11 $ s
- Total: 50 s ✅

So **minimum time is 50 seconds**, and it is **achievable** for any floor from 6/F to 34/F (inclusive), and even at 5/F and 35/F.

But the question says: **"the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F"**

So as long as $ x \neq 40 $, and $ x \in [2, 39] $, it's allowed.

So we can choose $ x = 10 $, for example, and get 50 s.

But is there a way to get **less than 50 s**?

No — because in the unconstrained case (no stop), it was 45 s.

With a stop, we must decelerate to 0 and then accelerate again — this adds **extra time**.

The **minimum possible time with a stop** is **50 seconds**.

So the answer is:

✅ **Answer 3: 50 seconds**
