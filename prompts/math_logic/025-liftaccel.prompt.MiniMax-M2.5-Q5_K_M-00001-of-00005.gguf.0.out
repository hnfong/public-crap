**Given data**

- Building height: 40 floors  
- Floor height = 5 m → total height = \(40 \times 5 = 200\) m  
- Elevator maximum speed \(v_{\max}=5\ \text{m/s}\)  
- Constant acceleration (or deceleration) \(a = 1\ \text{m/s}^2\)

The elevator can accelerate from rest, travel at constant speed, then decelerate to stop.  
If the distance to be covered is longer than the distance needed to reach \(v_{\max}\) and then brake to zero, the motion will have three phases:

- **Phase 1 (acceleration):** \(v = a t_1\), distance \(s_1 = \frac12 a t_1^2\).  
- **Phase 2 (constant speed):** speed = \(v_{\max}\), distance \(s_2 = v_{\max} t_2\).  
- **Phase 3 (deceleration):** same magnitude \(a\) as Phase 1, distance \(s_3 = \frac12 a t_3^2\) (with \(t_3 = t_1\) because \(v_{\max}=a t_1\)).  

Total distance \(s = s_1 + s_2 + s_3\).  
Total time \(t = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 2t_1 + t_2\).

The distance needed to accelerate to \(v_{\max}\) and then decelerate to zero is

\[
s_{\text{acc+dec}} = \frac{v_{\max}^2}{a} = \frac{5^2}{1}=25\ \text{m}.
\]

If the travel distance \(s \le 25\) m, the elevator never reaches the maximum speed; it just accelerates then decelerates.  
If \(s > 25\) m, it reaches \(v_{\max}\) and cruises for a while.

---

## 1. Ground floor (1/F) → top floor (40/F)

Travel distance \(s = 200\) m > 25 m, so the elevator will reach the maximum speed.

- Time to reach \(v_{\max}\): \(t_1 = \frac{v_{\max}}{a}= \frac{5}{1}=5\) s.  
- Distance covered while accelerating (or decelerating): \(s_1 = s_3 = \frac12 a t_1^2 = \frac12 (1)(5^2)=12.5\) m each.  

Thus the cruising distance is

\[
s_2 = s - s_1 - s_3 = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175\ \text{m}.
\]

Cruising time:

\[
t_2 = \frac{s_2}{v_{\max}} = \frac{175}{5}=35\ \text{s}.
\]

Total time:

\[
t = 2t_1 + t_2 = 2(5) + 35 = 45\ \text{s}.
\]

\[
\boxed{t_{1\to40}=45\ \text{s}}
\]

---

## 2. Two passengers: first to 10/F, second to 30/F

- Height to 10/F: \(s_{10}=9\times5=45\) m (since floor 1 is ground, floor 10 is 9 floors above).  
- Height to 30/F: \(s_{30}=29\times5=145\) m.

The elevator must stop at floor 10, let the first passenger out, then continue to floor 30.

We need the travel time from floor 1 to floor 10, then from floor 10 to floor 30.

### 1 → 10

\(s=45\) m > 25 m → reaches \(v_{\max}\).

- \(t_1 =5\) s, \(s_1=s_3=12.5\) m.  
- Cruising distance: \(s_2 = 45-25 =20\) m → \(t_2 =20/5=4\) s.  

\[
t_{1\to10}=2(5)+4=14\ \text{s}.
\]

### 10 → 30

Distance = \(145-45 = 100\) m.

Again \(>25\) m, so same \(t_1=5\) s, \(s_1=s_3=12.5\) m.

Cruising distance: \(s_2 = 100-25 =75\) m → \(t_2 =75/5=15\) s.

\[
t_{10\to30}=2(5)+15 = 25\ \text{s}.
\]

### Total time (including a negligible door‑open/close time)

\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{1\to10}+t_{10\to30}=14+25 = 39\ \text{s}.
\]

\[
\boxed{t_{\text{two‑stop}} = 39\ \text{s}}
\]

## 3. One passenger goes to 40/F, the other gets off at some intermediate floor (not 40/F).  
We want the **minimum possible time** for the lift to reach floor 40 while still stopping at another floor in between.

Let the second passenger alight at floor \(k\) (where \(2\le k \le 39\)).  
The elevator must travel:

1. From floor 1 to floor \(k\) (stop).  
2. From floor \(k\) to floor 40 (final destination).

We need to choose \(k\) that makes the total travel time as short as possible.

Let:

- \(s_k = (k-1)\times5\) m = distance from ground to floor \(k\).  
- \(s_{40}=200\) m.  
- The remaining leg after the stop: \(s_{40}-s_k = (40-k)\times5\) m.

Because the elevator must decelerate to a stop at floor \(k\) and then accelerate again, each leg will have its own acceleration‑cruise‑deceleration phases.

We can treat each leg independently (the same \(a\) and \(v_{\max}\) apply each time). The total time is the sum of the two leg times.

We need to compute the travel time for a given distance \(s\) (where \(s>25\) m) as:

\[
t(s) = 2t_1 + \frac{s-2s_1}{v_{\max}} = 2\cdot5 + \frac{s-25}{5}=10 + \frac{s-25}{5}.
\]

If \(s\le25\) m the formula would be different, but all possible stops are at least 5 m (floor 2) → \(s=5\) m, which is <25 m. However, we are looking for the *minimum* total time to reach floor 40 while making a stop; the stop at a very low floor would make the second leg huge, likely increasing total time. The optimal stop will be somewhere where both legs are long enough to reach \(v_{\max}\). So we can safely assume both legs exceed 25 m.

Thus for any leg of distance \(s\),

\[
t(s) = 10 + \frac{s-25}{5}=10 + 0.2(s-25)=0.2s +5.
\]

Check: for \(s=200\) m, \(t=0.2(200)+5=40+5=45\) s, which matches part 1.

Now total time for a stop at floor \(k\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
t_{\text{total}}(k) &= t(s_k) + t(200 - s_k)\\
&= \bigl[0.2 s_k +5\bigr] + \bigl[0.2(200-s_k)+5\bigr] \\
&= 0.2 s_k +5 + 40 -0.2 s_k +5 \\
&= 50\ \text{s}.
\end{aligned}
\]

**Interesting!** The terms containing \(s_k\) cancel, giving a constant total time of 50 s regardless of where the intermediate stop is (as long as both legs are long enough to reach \(v_{\max}\)).  

But we must verify that the assumption “both legs > 25 m” holds for the smallest possible \(k\).  

- Smallest \(k\) is 2 → \(s_k = (2-1)\times5 =5\) m (< 25 m).  
- For \(k=2\), the first leg does **not** reach \(v_{\max}\).  

Thus the simple linear formula is not valid for very low \(k\). We need to compute the exact time for the short leg (≤ 25 m) and then add the time for the long leg (≥ 175 m).  

Let’s compute the total time for each possible \(k\) and find the minimum.

### Leg 1: short distance \(s \le 25\) m (accelerate then decelerate, no cruising)

For a distance \(s\) with \(0 < s \le 25\) m, the motion is just acceleration for time \(t_a\) then deceleration for the same time, with total distance:

\[
s = \frac12 a t_a^2 + \frac12 a t_a^2 = a t_a^2.
\]

Thus

\[
t_a = \sqrt{\frac{s}{a}} = \sqrt{s}\quad (\text{since } a=1).
\]

Total time for that leg: \(t = 2 t_a = 2\sqrt{s}\).

(We can double‑check: for \(s=25\) m, \(t=2\sqrt{25}=10\) s, which matches the \(t=10\) s we got from the “reach‑vmax” formula: \(10 + (25-25)/5 =10\). Good.)

### Leg 2: long distance \(s \ge 25\) m

Time = \(10 + \frac{s-25}{5}=10+0.2(s-25)=0.2s+5\).

Now compute total time for each possible stop floor \(k\) (2 ≤ k ≤ 39).  

Let  

- \(s_1 = (k-1)\times5\) (distance from ground to floor \(k\)).  
- \(s_2 = 200 - s_1 = (40-k)\times5\).

We need to consider three regimes:

1. **Both legs > 25 m** → total = 50 s (as derived).  
   This occurs when \(s_1>25\) and \(s_2>25\).  
   - \(s_1>25\) → \(k-1 >5\) → \(k\ge7\).  
   - \(s_2>25\) → \(40-k >5\) → \(k\le34\).  

   So for \(k = 7,8,\dots,34\) the total time is exactly **50 s**.

2. **First leg ≤ 25 m, second leg > 25 m** (i.e., \(k\le6\)).  
   Then \(t_1 = 2\sqrt{s_1}\), \(t_2 = 0.2 s_2 +5\).  

   Compute for each \(k=2\) to \(6\):

| k | \(s_1\) (m) | \(t_1=2\sqrt{s_1}\) (s) | \(s_2\) (m) | \(t_2=0.2 s_2+5\) (s) | total (s) |
|---|------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| 2 | 5  | \(2\sqrt5≈4.472\) | 195 | \(0.2·195+5=44\) | **48.472** |
| 3 |10 | \(2\sqrt{10}≈6.325\) | 190 | \(0.2·190+5=43\) | **49.325** |
| 4 |15 | \(2\sqrt{15}≈7.746\) | 185 | \(0.2·185+5=42\) | **49.746** |
| 5 |20 | \(2\sqrt{20}≈8.944\) | 180 | \(0.2·180+5=41\) | **49.944** |
| 6 |25 | \(2\sqrt{25}=10\) | 175 | \(0.2·175+5=40\) | **50** |

   The minimum in this range is at \(k=2\) (floor 2), giving ≈ 48.47 s.

3. **First leg > 25 m, second leg ≤ 25 m** (i.e., \(k\ge35\)).  
   By symmetry (the same calculation as above but swapping legs), the total time will be the same as for \(k=2\) when \(k=38\), etc. Let's compute:

| k | \(s_1\) (m) | \(t_1=0.2 s_1+5\) (s) | \(s_2\) (m) | \(t_2=2\sqrt{s_2}\) (s) | total (s) |
|---|------------|----------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------|
|35|170|0.2·170+5=39|25|10|49|
|36|175|0.2·175+5=40|20|\(2\sqrt{20}=8.944\)|48.944|
|37|180|0.2·180+5=41|15|\(2\sqrt{15}=7.746\)|48.746|
|38|185|0.2·185+5=42|10|\(2\sqrt{10}=6.325\)|48.325|
|39|190|0.2·190+5=43|5|\(2\sqrt5=4.472\)|47.472|

The minimum occurs at \(k=39\) (floor 39), giving ≈ 47.47 s.

Thus the overall minimum total time is **≈ 47.5 s**, achieved when the intermediate stop is as close as possible to the top floor (i.e., floor 39) while still being a different floor from 40.  

(If we allowed the second passenger to stay on until floor 40, the time would be 45 s, but the problem says “does not go to the same (40/F) floor”.)

Therefore:

\[
\boxed{t_{\text{min}} \approx 47.5\ \text{s (floor 39)}}.
\]

### Summary

| Situation | Travel time |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1. Ground → 40/F (direct) | **45 s** |
| 2. Ground → 10/F → 30/F (two stops) | **39 s** |
| 3. Ground → some intermediate floor → 40/F (minimum) | **≈ 47.5 s** (stop at floor 39) |

The calculations assume instantaneous door opening/closing and no waiting time at the intermediate stop. If those times are non‑zero, they would add to each answer. [end of text]
