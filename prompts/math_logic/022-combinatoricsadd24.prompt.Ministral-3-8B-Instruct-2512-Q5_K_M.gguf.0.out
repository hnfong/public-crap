Let's try again carefully, ensuring we only use each number once and verify each step.

**Attempt 1:**
Expression: (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 * 1 = 7, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 2:**
Expression: (8 + 3) * (4 - 1) = 11 * 3 = 33, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 3:**
Expression: 8 * (4 - (3 / 1)) = 8 * (4 - 3) = 8 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 4:**
Expression: (8 + 1) * (4 - 3) = 9 * 1 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 5:**
Expression: (8 / (4 - (3 - 1))) = 8 / (4 - 2) = 8 / 2 = 4, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 6:**
Expression: (8 * 3) - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 7:**
Expression: ((8 - 4) * (3 + 1)) = (4 * 4) = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 8:**
Expression: (8 * (4 - 1)) / 3 = (8 * 3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying

**Attempt 9:**
Expression: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking:
(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.

So the correct expression is:
(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24 [end of text]
