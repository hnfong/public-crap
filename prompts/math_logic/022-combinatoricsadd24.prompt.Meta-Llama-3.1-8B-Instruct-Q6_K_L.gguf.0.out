Let's try again:

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 + 3) = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 + 3) - 1 = 8 * 7 - 1 = 56 - 1 = 55, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 8 * 3 + 3 = 24
Double checking: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 8 * 3 + 3 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 1, 3). This is correct!

The correct mathematical expression is: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 24. [end of text]
