This statement is a mnemonic device, or a memory aid, to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. It suggests that when you have a Celsius temperature that is a multiple of 12, you can easily find the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature by reversing the digits of the Celsius temperature.

Here's how it works:

1. Take a Celsius temperature that is a multiple of 12.
2. Reverse the digits of that temperature.
3. The reversed number is approximately the Fahrenheit temperature.

Let's look at some examples:

- 12°C: Reverse the digits to get 21. This is close to the actual Fahrenheit temperature of 53.6°F (12°C * 9/5 + 32 = 53.6°F).
- 24°C: Reverse the digits to get 42. This is close to the actual Fahrenheit temperature of 75.2°F (24°C * 9/5 + 32 = 75.2°F).
- 36°C: Reverse the digits to get 63. This is close to the actual Fahrenheit temperature of 96.8°F (36°C * 9/5 + 32 = 96.8°F).

Keep in mind that this is not an exact conversion method, but rather a quick and easy way to estimate the Fahrenheit temperature from Celsius. The actual conversion formula is:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

where \( F \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \( C \) is the temperature in Celsius. The mnemonic works because the multiplication by 9/5 (which is roughly 1.8) and the addition of 32 tend to result in numbers that are close to the reversed digits of the Celsius temperature, especially for multiples of 12. However, for other Celsius temperatures, the actual conversion formula should be used for accurate results. [end of text]
