I'll do my best to answer each of your questions with step-by-step explanations. Let's dive in!

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in various fields:

1. **Mathematics**: 
   - 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
   - It is the smallest number that is divisible by all integers from 1 to 5.
   - 120 is a triangular number (the sum of the first 16 natural numbers: 1+2+3+...+16=120).
   - It is also a hexagonal number and a pentagonal number.

2. **Geometry**: 
   - In a regular hexagon, the sum of the interior angles is 720 degrees, and each interior angle is 120 degrees.
   - In a regular pentagon, each interior angle is 108 degrees, but the sum of the exterior angles is 360 degrees, with each exterior angle being 72 degrees (120 - 48).

3. **Science and Technology**:
   - 120 volts is a common electrical voltage in North American power distribution.
   - 120 Hz is the standard frequency for AC power in many countries.

4. **Culture and History**:
   - In the Bible, Noah lived to be 120 years old.
   - The number 120 is mentioned in the Quran as the age of Noah when he began building the Ark.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula or factorization if possible. Let's try factorization first:

1. We need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. 
2. The numbers -9 and 2 satisfy this condition because (-9) * 2 = -18 and -9 + 2 = -7.
3. Therefore, we can factor the equation as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.
4. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   - x - 9 = 0 → x = 9
   - x + 2 = 0 → x = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To find out how many round trips the train can make in a day, we need to calculate the total time available in a day and divide it by the time taken for one round trip.

1. **Total time in a day**: 24 hours
2. **Distance for one round trip**: 200 km * 2 = 400 km
3. **Time taken for one round trip**: Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (approximately)
4. **Number of round trips in 24 hours**: 24 hours / 6.67 hours per trip ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can complete 3 full round trips in a 24-hour period. The 0.6 represents the fraction of time left for a fourth trip, which would not be completed within the day.

I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand each answer! Let me know if you have any further questions. [end of text]
