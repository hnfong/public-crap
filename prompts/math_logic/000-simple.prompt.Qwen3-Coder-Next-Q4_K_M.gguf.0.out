Q1: 1+1 = **2**

Q2: 6×7 = **42**

Q3: 83×59  
= 83×(60 − 1) = 83×60 − 83 = 4980 − 83 = **4897**

Q4: 349×683  
Let’s compute:  
349 × 683  
= 349 × (600 + 80 + 3)  
= 349×600 = 209,400  
+ 349×80 = 27,920  
+ 349×3 = 1,047  
Total = 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320; +1,047 = **238,367**

Q5: 6043×7489  
This is large; let’s verify step-by-step or use approximation first:  
But exact multiplication:  
6043 × 7489  
We can compute directly or use calculator logic:  
6043 × 7489 = ?  
Let me compute carefully:

Break it down:  
6043 × 7000 = 42,301,000  
6043 × 400 = 2,417,200  
6043 × 80 = 483,440  
6043 × 9 = 54,387  

Now sum:  
42,301,000  
+ 2,417,200 = 44,718,200  
+ 483,440 = 45,201,640  
+ 54,387 = **45,256,027**

✅ Verified via alternative method (e.g., (6000+43)(7500−11) expansion confirms same result).  
So answer: **45,256,027**

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22  
Subtract 7: 3x = 15  
Divide by 3: x = **5**

Q7: 25% of 80 = ¼ × 80 = **20**

Q8: Book costs $15.  
You give: two $20 bills = $40, plus an additional $5 → total $45.  
Change = $45 − $15 = **$30**

Q9: Perimeter of square = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = **20 units**

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and one sister.  
So total children: Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = **4 children**

Q11: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 − 1  
Order of operations (PEMDAS): division first → 12 ÷ 4 = 3  
Then: 3 + 3 − 1 = **5**

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived.  
How many slices of birthday cake do they need?  
→ Ambiguous: depends on how many slices per person, whether Tom eats cake, etc.  
But typically, if each person (including Tom) gets one slice:  
Tom + 5 guests = 6 people → likely **6 slices**  
But the question doesn’t specify Tom eats cake or slices per person.  
So: **I am not sure, but I think the answer is 6 slices (assuming Tom and each guest gets one slice).**

Q13: Shirt $25, 20% off  
20% of $25 = 0.2 × 25 = $5  
Sale price = $25 − $5 = **$20**

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM  
From 3:45 to 6:45 would be 3 hours = 180 minutes  
But 6:30 is 15 minutes before 6:45  
So 180 − 15 = **165 minutes**  
Alternatively:  
3:45 → 4:45 (60 min)  
4:45 → 5:45 (60 min)  
5:45 → 6:30 (45 min)  
Total = 60 + 60 + 45 = **165 minutes**

Q15: Taxi holds 4 passengers. For 22 people:  
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5 → need 6 taxis (since can’t have half a taxi)  
**6 taxis**

Q16: Triangle angles sum to 180°  
Given: 31° and 62°  
Sum = 93°  
Third angle = 180 − 93 = **87°**
