Alright, I need to answer these three math questions about a 40-story building with each floor being 5 meters tall. The elevator has an acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s² and a maximum speed of 5 m/s. Let's tackle each question step by step.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?**

First, I need to determine the total distance the elevator needs to travel. Since each floor is 5 meters tall and there are 40 floors, the total height is:
40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

Next, I need to consider the elevator's motion. The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, and finally decelerates from 5 m/s to rest.

Let's break it down:

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (v) = 5 m/s
   - Using the formula: v = a * t
   - Time to accelerate (t_acc) = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during acceleration (d_acc) = 0.5 * a * t_acc² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Let’s denote the time spent at constant speed as t_const
   - Distance covered during constant speed (d_const) = v * t_const

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Deceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Initial speed = 5 m/s
   - Final speed = 0 m/s
   - Using the formula: v = a * t
   - Time to decelerate (t_dec) = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during deceleration (d_dec) = 0.5 * a * t_dec² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

Now, the total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is:
d_acc + d_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters

Therefore, the distance covered at constant speed is:
d_const = Total distance - (d_acc + d_dec) = 200 - 25 = 175 meters

Now, calculate the time spent at constant speed:
t_const = d_const / v = 175 m / 5 m/s = 35 seconds

Finally, the total time is the sum of all phases:
Total time = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

First, calculate the distance each person travels:

- First person: 10/F to ground floor is 10 floors * 5 m = 50 meters
- Second person: 30/F to ground floor is 30 floors * 5 m = 150 meters

Since both people are going down, the elevator will have to stop at both 10/F and 30/F.

Let's outline the elevator's motion:

1. **From ground floor to 10/F:**
   - Distance = 50 meters
   - Time = distance / speed = 50 m / 5 m/s = 10 seconds

2. **Stop at 10/F:**
   - Let's assume the elevator stops for a short time, say 2 seconds.

3. **From 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Distance = 30 floors * 5 m = 150 meters
   - Time = distance / speed = 150 m / 5 m/s = 30 seconds

4. **Stop at 30/F:**
   - Another stop for 2 seconds.

5. **From 30/F to ground floor:**
   - Distance = 30 floors * 5 m = 150 meters
   - Time = distance / speed = 150 m / 5 m/s = 30 seconds

Now, sum up all the times:
Total time = 10 + 2 + 30 + 2 + 30 = 74 seconds

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize the total time, the elevator should stop at the floor that minimizes the waiting time for both passengers. The optimal stopping floor is the one that is halfway between the two destinations.

First person: 40/F
Second person: Let's assume they go to floor x (where x < 40)

The elevator will stop at floor x, pick up the second person, and then go to 40/F.

Let's denote:
- d1 = distance from ground floor to x = x * 5 m
- d2 = distance from x to 40/F = (40 - x) * 5 m

Total distance = d1 + d2 = x * 5 + (40 - x) * 5 = 200 meters

Since the elevator has a maximum speed of 5 m/s, the time to travel this distance is:
Time = distance / speed = 200 m / 5 m/s = 40 seconds

However, the elevator needs to accelerate and decelerate at 1 m/s².

Let's calculate the time spent accelerating and decelerating:

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (v) = 5 m/s
   - Time to accelerate (t_acc) = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during acceleration (d_acc) = 0.5 * a * t_acc² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

2. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Deceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Initial speed = 5 m/s
   - Final speed = 0 m/s
   - Time to decelerate (t_dec) = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during deceleration (d_dec) = 0.5 * a * t_dec² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

Total distance for acceleration and deceleration = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters

Therefore, the distance traveled at constant speed is:
d_const = Total distance - (d_acc + d_dec) = 200 - 25 = 175 meters

Time spent at constant speed:
t_const = d_const / v = 175 m / 5 m/s = 35 seconds

Now, sum up all the times:
Total time = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F, stopping at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, is 45 seconds.
