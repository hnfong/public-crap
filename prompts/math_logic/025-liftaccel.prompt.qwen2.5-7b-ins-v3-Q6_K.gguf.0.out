Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Alright, I need to solve these elevator-related math problems step by step. Let's start by understanding the given information and what each question is asking.

We have a 40-story building, and each floor is 5 meters tall. So, the total height of the building is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters. The elevator accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s², and its maximum speed is 5 m/s. 

**Question 1:** How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?

First, I need to determine the total distance the elevator travels. Since each floor is 5 meters, the total distance is 200 meters. The elevator has a maximum speed of 5 m/s, and it accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s².

To find the total time, I'll consider the elevator's motion in three phases:
1. **Acceleration phase:** The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed.
2. **Constant speed phase:** The elevator moves at its maximum speed.
3. **Deceleration phase:** The elevator slows down from maximum speed to rest.

Let's calculate each phase:

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
   - Final speed (v) = 5 m/s
   - Using the formula: v = a * t
   - So, t = v / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during acceleration: d = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Let’s denote the time spent at constant speed as t_const
   - Distance covered during this phase: d_const = v * t_const

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - Deceleration (a') = 1 m/s² (since it's slowing down)
   - Initial speed = 5 m/s
   - Final speed = 0 m/s
   - Using the formula: v = a' * t'
   - So, t' = v / a' = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
   - Distance covered during deceleration: d_decel = 0.5 * a' * t'² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

Now, the total distance covered by the elevator is 200 meters. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. Therefore, the distance covered at constant speed is 200 - 25 = 175 meters.

So, t_const = d_const / v = 175 m / 5 m/s = 35 seconds

Now, summing up all the phases:
- Total time = t_accel + t_const + t_decel = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds

**Question 2:** Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

First, calculate the distance each person travels:
- First person: 10 floors * 5 m/floor = 50 meters
- Second person: 30 floors * 5 m/floor = 150 meters

Assuming the elevator can serve both people without stopping at the same floor, the elevator will first go to 10/F, then to 30/F, and then to 40/F.

Let's calculate the time for each segment:

1. **From ground floor to 10/F:**
   - Distance = 50 meters
   - Using the same approach as Question 1:
     - t_accel = 5 seconds
     - d_accel = 12.5 meters
     - t_const = (50 - 12.5) / 5 = 8.5 seconds
     - t_decel = 5 seconds
     - Total time = 5 + 8.5 + 5 = 18.5 seconds

2. **From 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Distance = 100 meters
   - t_accel = 5 seconds
   - d_accel = 12.5 meters
   - t_const = (100 - 12.5) / 5 = 17 seconds
   - t_decel = 5 seconds
   - Total time = 5 + 17 + 5 = 27 seconds

3. **From 30/F to 40/F:**
   - Distance = 50 meters
   - t_accel = 5 seconds
   - d_accel = 12.5 meters
   - t_const = (50 - 12.5) / 5 = 8.5 seconds
   - t_decel = 5 seconds
   - Total time = 5 + 8.5 + 5 = 18.5 seconds

Now, summing up all the segments:
- Total time = 18.5 + 27 + 18.5 = 64 seconds

**Question 3:** Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To minimize the total time, the elevator should serve the second person's floor during the acceleration or deceleration phase of the first person's journey.

Let’s denote:
- Let’s assume the second person goes to floor x, where 1 < x < 40.

The elevator will accelerate to 5 m/s, serve the first person to 40/F, and then serve the second person to floor x.

To minimize time, the second person's floor should be as close as possible to the acceleration or deceleration points.

Let’s consider the elevator accelerates to 5 m/s over 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters.

If the second person's floor is at 12.5 meters, the elevator can serve them during the acceleration phase.

So, the elevator accelerates to 5 m/s, serves the first person to 40/F, and then decelerates to stop at floor x.

Calculating the time:

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - t_accel = 5 seconds
   - d_accel = 12.5 meters

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Distance to 40/F: 200 meters
   - t_const = 200 / 5 = 40 seconds

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - t_decel = 5 seconds
   - d_decel = 12.5 meters

Total time = 5 + 40 + 5 = 50 seconds

But since the second person's floor is at 12.5 meters, the elevator can serve them during the acceleration phase, saving time.

Therefore, the minimum time is 50 seconds.

<Output>
1. **Time to go from ground floor to top floor:** 45 seconds

2. **Time for two people to reach their respective floors:** 64 seconds

3. **Minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop at another floor:** 50 seconds
