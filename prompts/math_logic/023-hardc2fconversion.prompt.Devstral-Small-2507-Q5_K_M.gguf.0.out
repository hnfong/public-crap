The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help you quickly convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Let's break it down with examples.

### Explanation:
1. **Every 12°C**: This means you look at temperatures that are multiples of 12°C.
2. **The digits are inverted**: This means you swap the digits of the temperature when converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Examples:
Let's look at a few examples to see how this works:

1. **0°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - 0°C is a multiple of 12°C.
   - Invert the digits: 0 becomes 0.
   - 0°C = 32°F (This is a special case and doesn't follow the inversion rule strictly, but it's a key reference point.)

2. **12°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - 12°C is a multiple of 12°C.
   - Invert the digits: 12 becomes 21.
   - 12°C ≈ 54°F (Note: This is not exact, but it's close enough for quick estimation.)

3. **24°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - 24°C is a multiple of 12°C.
   - Invert the digits: 24 becomes 42.
   - 24°C ≈ 75°F (Again, this is an approximation.)

4. **36°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - 36°C is a multiple of 12°C.
   - Invert the digits: 36 becomes 63.
   - 36°C ≈ 97°F (This is also an approximation.)

### Why It Works:
The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

For multiples of 12°C, the conversion can be approximated by inverting the digits because the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales in a way that makes this trick useful for quick estimates.

### Limitations:
- This method is not exact and should be used for quick estimates rather than precise calculations.
- It works best for temperatures that are multiples of 12°C.

### Conclusion:
The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a handy way to remember a rough conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit for certain temperatures. It's not perfect, but it can be useful for quick mental calculations. [end of text]
