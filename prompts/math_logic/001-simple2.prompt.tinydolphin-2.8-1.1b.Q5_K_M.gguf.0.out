 Solution 1:
The significance of the number 120 is that it is the smallest multiple of 4 that is divisible by both 10 and 20. This means that 120 can be divided by both 10 and 20 without leaving any remainder.

Interesting properties:
1. 120 is a perfect square: 120 = 4^n, where n = 2, 4, 6, ...
2. 120 is an odd perfect square: 120 = 2^2 * 3

Solving the equation:
(x - 7)(x - 18) = 0

(x - 7)(x) + 18(x - 18) = 0

This is a quadratic equation with a unique root (x = 4).

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Step 1: Substitute x = 4 into the equation
4^2 - 7(4) - 18 = 0

Step 2: Combine like terms
4^2 - 7(4) = 0

Step 3: Isolate the terms with x
4^2 - 7(4) - 18 = 0 - 18

Step 4: Add 7(4) to both sides
(4^2 - 7(4) - 18 + 7(4)) + 7(4) = 0 + 7(4)

Step 5: Simplify the equation
(4^2 - 15) + 7(4) = 0 + 7(4)

Step 6: Isolate the term with 4
4^2 + 4 = 16

Step 7: Solve for x
x = 16

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Step 1: Determine the number of hours between the two cities
200 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours

Step 2: Convert hours to round trips
3 hours / (60 km / 10 km/h) = 0.05 round trips

Step 3: Calculate the number of round trips
3 * 0.05 = 0.15 round trips

So, it makes 0.15 round trips between the two cities within a full day.<|im_end|>
