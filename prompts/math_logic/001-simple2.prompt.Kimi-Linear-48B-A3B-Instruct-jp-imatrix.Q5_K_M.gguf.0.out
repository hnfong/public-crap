Let's solve each question step by step.

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**
120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Here are some of its interesting properties:

- **Highly composite number**: 120 has **16 divisors** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120), more than any number less than 120.
- **Factorial**: 120 = 5! (5 factorial), which is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects.
- **Divisible by many numbers**: It is divisible by 1 through 10 (except 7), making it useful in many practical and mathematical contexts.
- **In geometry**: A regular **120-cell** is a 4-dimensional polytope with 120 dodecahedral faces.
- **In time**: 120 seconds = 2 minutes, and 120 minutes = 2 hours.
- **In angles**: 120° is the internal angle of a regular **equilateral triangle** when divided into 3 equal parts.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Answer:**
We solve the quadratic equation using the **quadratic formula**:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

For the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we have:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -7 \)
- \( c = -18 \)

\[
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
\]

So the two solutions are:
- \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \)
- \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{x = 9 \text{ or } x = -2}
\]

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Answer:**
- **Distance one way**: 200 km  
- **Round trip distance**: 200 × 2 = 400 km  
- **Speed**: 60 km/h  
- **Time per round trip**: \( \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) hours  
- **Full day**: 24 hours  

\[
\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
\]

So the train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3 \text{ round trips}}
