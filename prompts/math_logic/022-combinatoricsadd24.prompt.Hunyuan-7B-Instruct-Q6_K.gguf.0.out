Attempt: $8 \times (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 \times 3 - 3 = 24$
Double checking: $8 \times (4 - 1) - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21$, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: $8 \times (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 \times 4 - 4 = 24$
Double checking: $8 \times (3 + 1) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28$, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: $4 \times (8 - 3) - 1 = 4 \times 5 - 1 = 24$
Double checking: $4 \times (8 - 3) - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19$, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: $8 \times (4 - 3 + 1) = 8 \times 2 = 16$, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: $4 \times (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 \times (8 - 2) = 4 \times 6 = 24$
Double checking: $4 \times (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 \times 6 = 24$. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.

Final Answer: $4 \times (8 - (3 - 1)) = 24$
