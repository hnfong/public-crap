The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a **rough approximation** and **not entirely accurate**, but it can be a helpful **mnemonic** for some temperature conversions. Let me explain what it means and how it works.

---

### 🔍 What does it mean?

The idea is that **for every 12 degrees Celsius**, the **Fahrenheit temperature is the reverse of the Celsius temperature**. For example:

- **12°C** → **22°F** (12 reversed is 21, but 12°C is actually 53.6°F, so this is not accurate)
- **24°C** → **42°F** (again, not accurate)

So, this rule is **not exact**, but it's a **simplified way** to remember that **Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures are related** in a way that sometimes the digits can be reversed.

### 🧠 Why is this a rough rule?

The actual formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

$$
°F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
$$

So, for example:

- 0°C = 32°F
- 10°C = 50°F
- 20°C = 68°F
- 30°C = 86°F
- 40°C = 104°F

You can see that the digits are **not** reversed in these examples.

### 🧩 Examples of the "digit inversion" idea (even though it's not exact):

Let’s look at a few temperatures where the **digits are reversed** in Celsius and Fahrenheit:

1. **-40°C = -40°F**  
   - This is the only temperature where Celsius and Fahrenheit are the same. So, the digits are the same, not reversed.

2. **12°C ≈ 53.6°F**  
   - 12 reversed is 21, but 53.6 is not 21.

3. **22°C ≈ 71.6°F**  
   - 22 reversed is 22, but 71.6 is not 22.

4. **32°C ≈ 89.6°F**  
   - 32 reversed is 23, but 89.6 is not 23.

So, the rule is **not accurate**, but it's a **fun and simple way** to remember that **Celsius and Fahrenheit are not the same scale**, and that **there is a relationship** between them.

---

### ✅ Summary:

- The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is **not accurate**.
- The actual formula is:  
  $$
  °F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
  $$
- The rule is a **mnemonic** or **approximation**, not a real conversion rule.
- It's a fun way to remember that **Celsius and Fahrenheit are different scales**, and that **converting between them requires a formula**.
