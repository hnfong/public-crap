 A1: The number 120 is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any number smaller than it. It's also a pronic number, formed by the product of two consecutive integers (10*12). 

Here are some of its interesting properties:

1. It's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of three non-zero cubes in nontrivial ways: 120 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 6^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 5^3 = 3^3 + 3^3 + 4^3.
2. It's the smallest number with exactly 10 divisors.
3. It's the smallest number which can be expressed as the product of the sum and the difference of two positive cubes: 120 = (1^3 + 2^3) * (2^3 - 1^3).

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

So, x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / 2*1
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

The solutions are:
x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -2

A3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. To find the time it takes to travel between the cities, we use the formula time = distance/speed. So, time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours, which is approximately 3.33 hours for a one-way trip.

Since a full day is 24 hours, the number of round trips the train can make is:

number of round trips = total time / time per round trip
= 24 hours / (3.33 hours * 2)
≈ 3.6 round trips

However, since the train can't complete a partial round trip, it can make only 3 round trips within a full day. [end of text]
