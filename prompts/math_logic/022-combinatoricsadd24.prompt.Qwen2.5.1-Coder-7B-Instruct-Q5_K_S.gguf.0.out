Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Let's try different combinations of the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) to construct a mathematical expression that results in 24.

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * (4 + 3) = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 8 * 3 + 3 = 24
Double checking: 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
```

The correct expression is:

```
8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 24
