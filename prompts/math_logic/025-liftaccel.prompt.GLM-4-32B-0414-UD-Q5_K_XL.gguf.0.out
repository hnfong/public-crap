Let's tackle each question one by one.

### Given:
- Building height: 40 floors
- Each floor height: 5 meters
- Total height: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters
- Lift acceleration/deceleration: \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- Maximum speed: \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Key Concepts:
1. **Time to reach max speed**: \( t = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s} \)
2. **Distance covered while accelerating to max speed**: \( d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \)
3. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: Same as acceleration time, \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Distance covered at max speed**: If total distance \( D \) is greater than \( 2 \times 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} \), then the lift spends time at max speed. Otherwise, it doesn't reach max speed.

### Question 1: Time from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)
Total distance: \( 200 \, \text{m} \).

Since \( 200 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m} \), the lift will reach max speed.

1. **Time to accelerate to max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
2. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
3. **Distance covered at max speed**: \( 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Time at max speed**: \( \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{s} \).

### Question 2: Two people going to 10/F and 30/F
Total distance: \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m} \) (since the lift goes to 30/F).

Since \( 150 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m} \), the lift reaches max speed.

1. **Time to accelerate to max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
2. **Time to decelerate from max speed**: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
3. **Distance covered at max speed**: \( 150 - 25 = 125 \, \text{m} \).
4. **Time at max speed**: \( \frac{125}{5} = 25 \, \text{s} \).

Total time: \( 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \, \text{s} \).

### Question 3: First person to 40/F, second person to another floor (not 40/F), minimum time to 40/F
To minimize time to 40/F, the lift should stop as late as possible (i.e., just before 40/F). The second person must go to some floor \( n \) where \( 1 \leq n < 40 \).

The lift will:
1. Accelerate to max speed.
2. Travel at max speed until just before floor \( n \).
3. Decelerate to stop at floor \( n \).
4. Accelerate again to max speed.
5. Travel at max speed until just before 40/F.
6. Decelerate to stop at 40/F.

However, to minimize time to 40/F, the lift should not stop at \( n \) but instead pass \( n \) without stopping (but this contradicts the problem statement that the second person goes to another floor). Thus, the lift must stop at \( n \).

The minimal time occurs when \( n \) is as close to 40/F as possible. Let's assume \( n = 39/F \).

Total distance: \( 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{m} \).

1. **First segment (1/F to 39/F)**:
   - Distance: \( 195 \, \text{m} \).
   - Since \( 195 \, \text{m} > 25 \, \text{m} \), the lift reaches max speed.
   - Time to accelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time to decelerate: \( 5 \, \text{s} \), covering \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
   - Distance at max speed: \( 195 - 25 = 170 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time at max speed: \( \frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{s} \).
   - Total time for first segment: \( 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \, \text{s} \).

2. **Second segment (39/F to 40/F)**:
   - Distance: \( 5 \, \text{m} \).
   - The lift must accelerate and decelerate within \( 5 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time to accelerate to some speed \( v \): \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 2.5}{1}} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \, \text{s} \) (since it covers \( 2.5 \, \text{m} \) accelerating and \( 2.5 \, \text{m} \) decelerating).
   - Total time for second segment: \( 2 \times 2.236 \approx 4.472 \, \text{s} \).

Total time to 40/F: \( 44 + 4.472 \approx 48.472 \, \text{s} \).

However, this seems longer than the direct trip to 40/F (45 s). This suggests that stopping at any floor \( n \) will increase the time beyond the direct trip. Thus, the minimal time is achieved when the lift does not stop at \( n \), but this contradicts the problem's condition. 

Given the problem's constraints, the minimal time is when the lift stops at the highest possible floor before 40/F, which is 39/F, leading to approximately \( 48.472 \, \text{s} \).

But let's re-examine the first segment. If the lift stops at 39/F, it must decelerate to 0 at 39/F, then accelerate again to reach 40/F. The time to go from 39/F to 40/F is the time to accelerate to some speed and then decelerate, covering 5 m. The minimal time for this is when the lift accelerates for \( t \) seconds and decelerates for \( t \) seconds, covering \( d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = a t^2 \). Here, \( d = 5 \, \text{m} \), \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), so \( t = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \, \text{s} \), total time \( 4.472 \, \text{s} \).

The first segment (1/F to 39/F) is 195 m. The lift can reach max speed (5 m/s) in 5 s (12.5 m), then travel at max speed for \( \frac{195 - 25}{5} = 34 \, \text{s} \), then decelerate for 5 s (12.
