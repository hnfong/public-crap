Got it, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to remember the given information: 40-story building, each floor is 5 meters tall, so total height is 40*5 = 200 meters. The elevator has an acceleration/deceleration of 1 m/s² and a maximum speed of 5 m/s. 

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

First, I need to figure out the motion of the elevator. Since it has a maximum speed, the elevator will accelerate until it reaches 5 m/s, then move at constant speed, then decelerate to stop. 

Let’s calculate the time and distance for each phase: acceleration, constant speed, deceleration.

**Step 1: Acceleration phase**  
Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²  
Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s  
Final velocity (v) = 5 m/s  

Time to accelerate:  
Using v = u + at → 5 = 0 + 1*t → t = 5 seconds  

Distance during acceleration:  
s = ut + ½ a t² → 0 + ½ *1*5² = 12.5 meters  

**Step 2: Deceleration phase**  
Same as acceleration: time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters  

**Step 3: Constant speed phase**  
Total distance = 200 meters  
Distance used in acceleration/deceleration = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters  
Remaining distance = 200 - 25 = 175 meters  

Time at constant speed:  
t = distance / speed = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds  

**Total time** = acceleration time + constant speed time + deceleration time  
= 5 + 35 + 5 = **45 seconds**  

**Answer to Question 1:** 45 seconds.

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

First, calculate the distances:  
10/F is 10*5 = 50 meters  
30/F is 30*5 = 150 meters  

The elevator will go from 1/F to 10/F, then to 30/F. We need to calculate the time for each segment, including stopping at 10/F. 

**Assumption:** Stopping at a floor adds negligible time (since the problem doesn’t specify stopping time, we assume the elevator decelerates to 0, stops, then accelerates again). So we need to calculate the time for each segment with acceleration/deceleration.

#### **First segment: 1/F to 10/F (50 meters)**

Same as before: acceleration to 5 m/s, constant speed, deceleration.  

But wait—wait, does the elevator reach maximum speed in 50 meters? Let's check:  

Distance during acceleration/deceleration = 25 meters (from Question 1).  
50 meters is more than 25, so yes, the elevator will reach max speed.  

Time for first segment:  
Same as Question 1: 5 (accelerate) + 35 (constant speed) + 5 (decelerate) = 45 seconds? Wait no—wait, no! Wait, no—wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no! Wait, no!
