We are given a 40-story building, each floor is 5 meters tall. So the height from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F) is:

> **Total height = (40 - 1) × 5 m = 39 × 5 = 195 meters**

The elevator:
- Accelerates and decelerates at **1 m/s²**
- Maximum speed: **5 m/s**

We assume the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches max speed (5 m/s), then cruises at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop.

We'll solve each question step by step.

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?**

Total height: 39 floors × 5 m = **195 meters**

### Step 1: Find time and distance to accelerate to max speed

Acceleration: a = 1 m/s²  
Max speed: v_max = 5 m/s

Time to reach max speed:  
> t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = **5 seconds**

Distance covered during acceleration:  
> s_acc = (1/2) * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * 25 = **12.5 meters**

Same distance during deceleration (since deceleration is also 1 m/s², symmetric):  
> s_dec = 12.5 meters

So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration:  
> s_acc + s_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = **25 meters**

Total distance to cover: **195 meters**

So distance traveled at constant speed:  
> s_const = 195 - 25 = **170 meters**

Time at constant speed:  
> t_const = distance / speed = 170 / 5 = **34 seconds**

Time to accelerate: 5 s  
Time to decelerate: 5 s  
Time at constant speed: 34 s

**Total time = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds**

✅ **Answer to Question 1: 44 seconds**

---

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

We assume the elevator must stop at both floors. The question is: **How long does it take for the lift to deliver both people?**

We assume the lift goes to the **first stop**, then continues to the second stop, and stops at each.

We need to know the **order** of stops. Since the question doesn’t specify, we assume the **most efficient** order: go to the **lower floor first**, then the higher one.

So:  
- Go from 1/F (ground) to 10/F → stop → then go to 30/F → stop → then continue? But the question is: **How long does it take?**

We assume the lift **delivers both people and then stops**. So the lift goes:

1. From 1/F → 10/F (first stop)  
2. Then from 10/F to 30/F  
3. Then stops at 30/F → done.

We need to compute total time from 1/F → 10/F → 30/F.

We assume the lift **accelerates, reaches max speed, then decelerates** for each leg, **but** when going from 10/F to 30/F, it may not start from rest? But in real elevators, it **stops completely** at each floor. So we assume:

- At 10/F: stops completely → then starts again to go to 30/F.

So we compute:

### Leg 1: 1/F → 10/F

Height: (10 - 1) × 5 = 9 × 5 = **45 meters**

We need to compute time to go 45 m with acceleration 1 m/s², max speed 5 m/s.

First, check if the elevator reaches max speed.

Distance to accelerate to max speed:  
s_acc = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * (5)² = 12.5 m (as before)

Same for deceleration: 12.5 m

So total distance for accel + decel = 25 m

But total distance = 45 m → so **there is a cruising phase**

Distance at constant speed = 45 - 12.5 - 12.5 = **20 meters**

Time to accelerate: 5 s  
Time to decelerate: 5 s  
Time cruising: 20 m / 5 m/s = **4 s**

Total time for Leg 1 (1/F → 10/F):  
5 + 4 + 5 = **14 seconds**

---

### Leg 2: 10/F → 30/F

Height: (30 - 10) × 5 = 20 × 5 = **100 meters**

Check if elevator reaches max speed:

Distance to accelerate to max speed: 12.5 m  
Same for deceleration: 12.5 m  
Total for accel + decel = 25 m

Remaining distance at constant speed: 100 - 25 = **75 meters**

Time cruising: 75 / 5 = **15 seconds**

Time accelerating: 5 s  
Time decelerating: 5 s

Total time for Leg 2: 5 + 15 + 5 = **25 seconds**

---

### Total time for both legs:

Leg 1 (1/F → 10/F): 14 s  
Leg 2 (10/F → 30/F): 25 s  
**Total time = 14 + 25 = 39 seconds**

✅ **Answer to Question 2: 39 seconds**

---

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

We are to find the **minimum time** to reach 40/F, **with a mandatory stop at another floor** (i.e., cannot go directly from 1/F to 40/F — must stop at least once in between).

We want to **minimize total time** to reach 40/F, with **one mandatory intermediate stop**.

We need to choose **which floor to stop at** to **minimize total time**.

Let’s denote:

- Total distance from 1/F to 40/F: 39 × 5 = **195 m**

We must stop at **some floor k** (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 39), so we go:

1. 1/F → k/F (stop)  
2. k/F → 40/F

We want to **minimize total time** over all possible k (2 ≤ k ≤ 39)

We already know how to compute time for any distance with acceleration/deceleration.

Let’s define a function:

> For a distance **d** meters, time to travel with a = 1 m/s², v_max = 5 m/s:

We need to check if the distance allows reaching max speed.

Distance to accelerate to max speed:  
s_acc = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * (5)² = 12.5 m  
Same for deceleration: 12.5 m

So if distance **d ≤ 25 m**, then the elevator **never reaches max speed** — it accelerates then immediately decelerates.

If d > 25 m, then it accelerates to 5 m/s, cruises, then decelerates.

We need to compute total time for **any intermediate stop k** (from 2 to 39), and find the **minimum total time**.

Total journey:  
1. 1/F → k/F (distance d1 = (k - 1) * 5 m)  
2. k/F → 40/F (distance d2 = (40 - k) * 5 m)

Total time = time1 + time2

We need to compute total time for each k from 2 to 39, and find the **minimum**.

But computing 38 cases manually is tedious. Let’s think strategically.

We want to **minimize total time** = time(1→k) + time(k→40)

Note: The time function for distance d is:

Let’s define a function T(d):

- If d ≤ 25 m:  
  The elevator accelerates for t1, then immediately decelerates.  
  Since acceleration = deceleration = 1 m/s², the max speed reached is v = sqrt(a * d)  
  But since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, time to accelerate = time to decelerate = t, and d = 2 * (0.5 * a * t²) = a * t²  
  So: d = a * t² → t = sqrt(d / a)  
  Total time = 2 * t = 2 * sqrt(d / a)

But wait — this is only if the elevator **never reaches max speed**.

If d > 25 m, then it reaches max speed.

So we need to define T(d):

Let a = 1 m/s², v_max = 5 m/s

Case 1: d ≤ 25 m → no cruising  
Time = 2 * sqrt(d / a) = 2 * sqrt(d)

Case 2: d > 25 m → reaches max speed  
- Distance to accelerate to v_max: s_acc = 12.5 m  
- Same for deceleration: 12.5 m  
- So cruising distance: d_cruise = d - 25  
- Time accelerating: t_acc = 5 s  
- Time decelerating: 5 s  
- Time cruising: t_cruise = (d - 25) / 5

So total time:  
T(d) = 5 + 5 + (d - 25)/5 = 10 + (d - 25)/5 = 10 + d/5 - 5 = **5 + d/5**

Wait — let me recast:

T(d) = t_acc + t_cruise + t_dec  
= 5 + [(d - 25)/5] + 5 = 10 + (d - 25)/5  
= 10 + d/5 - 5 = **5 + d/5**

Wait — let me compute numerically:

If d = 25 m → T = 5 + 5 = 10 s  
Using formula: 5 + d/5 = 5 + 25/5 = 5 + 5 = 10 → OK

If d = 195 m → T = 5 + 195/5 = 5 + 39 = 44 s → matches Question 1!

So general formula for d > 25 m:  
> **T(d) = 5 + d/5**

For d ≤ 25 m:  
T(d) = 2 * sqrt(d)  [since d = 0.5*a*t² * 2 → d = a*t² → t = sqrt(d/a) → total time = 2*sqrt(d)]

So now, back to **Question 3**:

> Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the **minimum time** it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

So the lift must go to 40/F, but **must stop at least once** at some floor k (2 ≤ k ≤ 39) before going to 40/F.

We want to **minimize total time** to reach 40/F, with **one mandatory stop** at some floor k (2 ≤ k ≤ 39).

The lift path:  
1/F → k/F (stop) → 40/F

We need to compute total time for each possible k (2 to 39), and find the **minimum**.

Total time = T1 + T2  
T1 = time from 1/F to k/F  
T2 = time from k/F to 40/F

We need to compute for each k from 2 to 39:

- d1 = (k - 1) * 5  
- d2 = (40 - k) * 5

Then compute T1 and T2 using:

- If d ≤ 25 m → T = 2 * sqrt(d)  
- If d > 25 m → T = 5 + d/5

We want to **minimize total time = T1 + T2**

Let’s think strategically.

We want to **minimize** T1 + T2.

Note: The time function is **convex** — it’s faster to go shorter distances, but the time function has a kink at 25 m.

Let’s try to find the **optimal k**.

We can try k = 6 (30 m to k=6: d1 = 5*5=25m, d2=34*5=170m)

Let’s compute total time for a few candidate k values.

---

### Candidate 1: k = 6 (d1 = 5*5 = 25 m, d2 = 34*5 = 170 m)

T1: d1 = 25 m → T1 = 2 * sqrt(25) = 2 * 5 = 10 s  
T2: d2 = 170 m → T2 = 5 + 170/5 = 5 + 34 = 39 s  
Total = 10 + 39 = **49 s**

But wait — in Question 1, direct trip was 44 s. So this is worse.

We need to **minimize** total time.

What if we stop at a floor where **both legs are under 25 m**? But total distance is 195 m. If we stop at k, then d1 + d2 = 195 m.

If both d1 and d2 ≤ 25 m, then total distance ≤ 50 m — impossible.

So **at least one leg must be >25 m**.

We want to **minimize** T1 + T2.

Let’s try stopping at k such that **d1 is just above 25 m**, and d2 is large, but we use the linear time function.

Let’s try k = 6 → d1 = 25 m → T1 = 10 s  
d2 = 170 m → T2 = 5 + 170/5 = 39 → total = 49 s

But direct trip is 44 s — so worse.

What if we stop at a floor where **d1 is just below 25 m**, and d2 is large, but we use the sqrt time for d1.

Try k = 5 → d1 = 4*5 = 20 m → T1 = 2*sqrt(20) ≈ 2*4.472 = 8.944 s  
d2 = 35*5 = 175 m → T2 = 5 + 175/5 = 5 + 35 = 40 s  
Total = 8.944 + 40 = **48.944 s**

Still worse than direct 44 s.

What if we stop at a floor where **d2 is small**? But d1 + d2 = 195 m.

Suppose we stop at k=39 → d1 = 38*5 = 190 m → T1 = 5 + 190/5 = 5 + 38 = 43 s  
d2 = 5 m → T2 = 2*sqrt(5) ≈ 4.472 s  
Total = 43 + 4.472 = **47.472 s**

Still worse than direct 44 s.

Wait — what if we stop at a floor where **both legs are above 25 m**? Then both use linear time.

Total time = T1 + T2 = [5 + d1/5] + [5 + d2/5] = 10 + (d1 + d2)/5 = 10 + 195/5 = 10 + 39 = **49 s**

Worse than direct.

Wait — **direct trip is 44 s**. But the problem says: "**it has to stop at another floor**" — so direct trip is **not allowed**.

So we must stop at least once.

So the **minimum possible time** is **greater than 44 s**.

We need to find the **minimum possible time** with **one mandatory stop**.

So we need to **minimize T1 + T2**, where d1 + d2 = 195 m, and d1 = 5*(k-1), d2 = 5*(40-k), for k = 2 to 39.

We need to minimize:

T(k) = T1 + T2

Where:

d1 = 5*(k-1)  
d2 = 5*(40 - k)

We need to compute T1 and T2 based on whether d1 ≤ 25 or >25, same for d2.

We can write a small table.

Note: d1 = 5*(k-1)  
d2 = 5*(40 - k)

We want to minimize T1 + T2

Let’s find k such that d1 and d2 are as close as possible to 25 m, because the time function changes at 25 m.

Let’s try k = 6 → d1 = 5*5 = 25 m → T1 = 2*sqrt(25) = 10 s  
d2 = 5*(40-6) = 5*34 = 170 m → T2 = 5 + 170/5 = 5 + 34 = 39 s  
Total = 10 + 39 = **49 s**

Try k = 7 → d1 = 5*6 = 30 m → T1 = 5 + 30/5 = 5 + 6 = 11 s  
d2 = 5*(40-7) = 5*33 = 165 m → T2 = 5 + 165/5 = 5 + 33 = 38 s  
Total = 11 + 38 = **49 s**

Try k = 10 → d1 = 5*9 = 45 m → T1 = 5 + 45/5 = 5 + 9 = 14 s  
d2 = 5*(40-10) = 150 m → T2 = 5 + 150/5 = 5 + 30 = 35 s  
Total = 10 + 35 = **45 s**

Better.

Try k = 15 → d1 = 5*14 = 70 m → T1 = 5 + 70/5 = 5 + 14 = 19 s  
d2 = 5*(40-20) = 100 m → T2 = 5 + 20 = 25 s  
Total = 19 + 25 = 44 s

Better.

Try k = 25 → d1 = 5*24 = 120 m → T1 = 5 + 24 = 29 s  
d2 = 5*(40-40) = 0? No — k=40 is top floor — not allowed.

Try k = 35 → d1 = 5*34 = 170 m → T1 = 5 + 34 = 39 s  
d2 = 5*(40-40) = 0? No — k=39 → d2 = 5*(40-39) = 5 m → T2 = 2*sqrt(5) ≈ 4.472 s  
Total = T1 + T2 = [5 + 170/5] + 2*sqrt(5) = [5 + 34] + 4.472 = 39 + 4.472 = 43.472 s

Better!

Try k = 31 → d1 = 5*30 = 150 m → T1 = 5 + 150/5 = 5 + 30 = 35 s  
d2 = 5*(40-30) = 50 m → T2 = 5 + 50/5 = 5 + 10 = 15 s  
Total = 15 + 15 = 30 s? No — T1 = 15 s, T2 = 15 s → total 30 s? That can’t be right.

Wait — T1 = time for 195 - 50 = 145 m? No.

Wait — if k = 30, then d1 = distance from 1/F to 30/F = (30-1)*5 = 145 m  
d2 = (40-30)*5 = 50 m

T1 = time for 145 m:  
Since 145 > 25 → T1 = 5 + 145/5 = 5 + 29 = 34 s  
T2 = time for (40-30)*5 = 50 m → T2 = 5 + 50/5 = 5 + 10 = 15 s  
Total = 30 s? That can’t be right — 30 + 15 = 45 s? No:

T1 = time for 195 m = 5 + 195/5 = 5 + 39 = 44 s  
T2 = time for (40-30)*5 = 50 m → T2 = 5 + 50/5 = 5 + 10 = 15 s  
Total = 44 + 15 = 59 s — too high.

Wait — we are double-counting? No — T1 is time for first leg, T2 for second leg.

But 44 + 15 = 59 s — that’s way too high.

Wait — I think I made a mistake in the formula.

The formula for time for distance d (d > 25 m) is:  
T = 5 + d/5

Wait — let me derive:

For d > 25 m:  
T = t_acc + t_cruise + t_dec  
t_acc = 5 s  
t_dec = 5 s  
t_cruise = d_cruise / v = (d - 25) / 5

So T = 5 + 5 + (d - 25)/5 = 10 + (d - 25)/5

For d = 25: T = 10 + 0 = 10 s — correct.

For d = 25 + x → T = 10 + x/5

So for d = 170: T = 10 + 170/5 = 10 + 34 = 44 s — yes.

But 170/5 = 34 → yes.
