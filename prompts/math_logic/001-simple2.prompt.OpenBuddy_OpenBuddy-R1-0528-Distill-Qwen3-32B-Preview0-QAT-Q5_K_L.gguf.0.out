Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Specifically, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
2. It is a factorial number, as 120 = 5! (5 factorial) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.
3. It is a Harshad number, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 is divisible by 3).
4. It is a triangular number, as it can be represented as the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120.
5. It is a tetrahedral number, as it can be represented as the sum of the first 8 triangular numbers: 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 + 28 + 36 = 120.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

So, the two solutions are:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip. Since the distance between the two cities is 200 km and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, the time it takes to travel from one city to the other is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.333... hours

Since a round trip consists of two one-way trips, the total time for one round trip is:

Total time = 2 * Time
Total time = 2 * 3.333...
Total time = 6.666... hours

Now, we need to find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day (24 hours). To do this, we divide the total time available by the time it takes for one round trip:

Number of round trips = Total time available / Time per round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.666... hours
Number of round trips = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
