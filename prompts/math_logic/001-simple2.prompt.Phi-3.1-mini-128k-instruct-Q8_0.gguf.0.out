Q1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons, and it has several interesting properties:

1. It is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

2. It is the smallest number that is divisible by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

3. It is the product of the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 4, 5) multiplied together (2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 120).

4. It is the smallest number that has exactly 16 divisors.

5. It is the sum of the first six factorials (1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 + 720 = 873, which is not equal to 120, but it's interesting to note that 120 is a factorial of 5 (5! = 120).

6. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: 120 = 2^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 216.

7. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in two different ways: 120 = 2^2 + 6^2 = 4 + 36 = 10^2 + 2^2.

8. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive positive integers: 120 = 55 + 65.

9. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive positive cubes: 120 = 5^3 + 3^3 = 125 + 27.

10. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive positive fourth powers: 120 = 2^4 + 2^4 = 16 + 16.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = [-(-7) ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))] / (2(1))
x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± √121] / 2
x = [7 ± 11] / 2

This gives us two solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time for one way is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.33 hours

Since a round trip is twice the one-way distance, the time for a round trip is:

Round trip time = 2 * (10/3 hours) = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.67 hours

There are 24 hours in a full day. To find out how many round trips the train can make in a full day, we divide the total time available by the time for one round trip:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / (20/3 hours per round trip)
Number of round trips = 24 * (3/20)
Number of round trips = 72/20
Number of round trips = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it can make 3 full round trips in a full day.<|im_end|>
