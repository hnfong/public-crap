 A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

- It is a composite number, meaning it has factors other than 1 and itself.

- It is the sum of the first six triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21).

- It is the sum of the first five square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25).

- It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number.

- It is the smallest number that is divisible by the numbers 1 through 10.

- It is the smallest number that has exactly 12 divisors.

- It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: 120 = 2^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 216.


A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2

x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

So, the solutions are:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2


A3: To find out how many round trips a train can make in a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

Distance for one round trip = 200 km * 2 = 400 km

Speed = 60 km/h

Time for one round trip = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours


A full day has 24 hours.

Number of round trips in a full day = 24 hours / 6.67 hours per round trip ≈ 3.59


Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips in a full day. [end of text]
