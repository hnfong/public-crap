We are given: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s."

Interpretation: The building has 40 stories. Each floor is 5 meters tall. So total height from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F) is: Actually careful: "ground floor (1/F)" means floor 1 is ground floor? Typically ground floor is floor 1, and top floor is floor 40. So the distance from floor 1 to floor 40 is (40-1)*5 = 39*5 = 195 meters. But sometimes "ground floor" is considered floor 0? But it says "ground floor (1/F)" so floor 1 is ground. So we have floors numbered 1 to 40. So the lift goes from floor 1 to floor 40. That is a vertical distance of (40-1)*5 = 195 m.

Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s^2. Maximum speed = 5 m/s.

We need to answer three questions.

Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor? That is from floor 1 to floor 40, distance 195 m, with acceleration 1 m/s^2 up to max speed 5 m/s, then possibly constant speed, then deceleration to stop at top.

We need to compute the time for a trip with acceleration, constant speed, deceleration. Since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric (both 1 m/s^2), we can consider the distance needed to accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s: using v^2 = u^2 + 2as, with u=0, v=5, a=1 => s = (25)/(2*1)=12.5 m. Similarly deceleration from 5 to 0 over same distance: 12.5 m. So total distance for acceleration and deceleration phases: 25 m. The remaining distance: 195 - 25 = 170 m. That remaining distance can be covered at constant maximum speed 5 m/s. Time at constant speed: 170/5 = 34 s. Time for acceleration: from 0 to 5 with a=1: t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 s. Similarly deceleration: 5 s. So total time = 5+34+5 = 44 s.

But we need to check if the lift actually reaches maximum speed. That is, if the distance is long enough to reach max speed. Here we have 195 m, and the distance to reach max speed and then decelerate is 25 m, so yes, it reaches max speed. So answer for Q1: 44 seconds.

But wait: Could there be any nuance? The building has 40 floors, each 5 m tall. So from floor 1 to floor 40 is indeed 39 intervals? Actually if floor 1 is ground, then floor 2 is 5 m above, floor 3 is 10 m, ..., floor 40 is (40-1)*5 = 195 m. So correct.

Now Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take? That means the lift starts at floor 1, goes to floor 10, stops, then goes to floor 30, stops. So we need total time from start at floor 1 to arrival at floor 30, including stops at floor 10 and floor 30. But careful: The lift picks up both at floor 1. Then it goes to floor 10, stops to let first person off. Then continues to floor 30, stops to let second person off. So we need time from floor 1 to floor 30 with an intermediate stop at floor 10. But note: When it stops at floor 10, it decelerates to stop, then later accelerates from floor 10 to floor 30. So we have two trips: from floor 1 to floor 10, and from floor 10 to floor 30. But we must consider that after stopping at floor 10, the lift is at rest, then it accelerates again. So total time = time from floor 1 to floor 10 (including deceleration to stop at floor 10) + time from floor 10 to floor 30 (including acceleration from rest at floor 10 and deceleration to stop at floor 30). But careful: When going from floor 1 to floor 10, the lift starts from rest at floor 1, accelerates, maybe reaches max speed, then decelerates to stop at floor 10. Similarly from floor 10 to floor 30. But we need to compute each segment separately.

First, distance from floor 1 to floor 10: (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45 m.
Distance from floor 10 to floor 30: (30-10)*5 = 20*5 = 100 m.

For each segment, we need to see if the lift reaches max speed. For a segment of distance d, with acceleration a=1, max speed v_max=5, the distance needed to accelerate to max speed and then decelerate to stop is 2*(v_max^2/(2a)) = v_max^2/a = 25/1 = 25 m. So if d > 25 m, then it will reach max speed; if d <= 25 m, it might not reach max speed, and the motion is triangular (accelerate then decelerate without constant speed phase). For d=45 m: 45 > 25, so it will reach max speed. For d=100 m: 100 > 25, so also reaches max speed.

So for segment 1 (45 m): 
Acceleration distance: 12.5 m, time: 5 s.
Deceleration distance: 12.5 m, time: 5 s.
Constant speed distance: 45 - 25 = 20 m, time: 20/5 = 4 s.
Total time for segment 1: 5+4+5 = 14 s.

But wait: Is that correct? Actually careful: When going from floor 1 to floor 10, the lift starts at rest at floor 1, accelerates to max speed, then at some point it must start decelerating to stop at floor 10. The distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 25 m. So constant speed phase covers the remaining 20 m. So time: acceleration 5 s, constant speed 4 s, deceleration 5 s = 14 s.

Now segment 2 (100 m): 
Acceleration: 5 s, deceleration: 5 s, constant speed distance: 100 - 25 = 75 m, time: 75/5 = 15 s. Total: 5+15+5 = 25 s.

But is there any time lost during the stop at floor 10? The problem likely assumes that the stop time is negligible? Usually in such problems, we assume the lift stops instantaneously? But actually, when it stops, it decelerates to zero speed, and then after a pause (maybe door opening/closing) it starts again. But the problem statement does not mention any additional stop time. It says "How long does it take?" meaning the time from start at ground floor to arrival at top floor? But here we have two people: first gets off at 10/F, second at 30/F. So the lift goes from 1 to 10 to 30. The time we computed is the travel time between floors, but we also need to consider the time spent at floor 10 while the first person gets off? Possibly the lift stops and then immediately starts again? The problem likely assumes that the stop is just the deceleration to zero and then acceleration from zero, and there is no additional waiting time. But careful: When the lift arrives at floor 10, it decelerates to stop. That deceleration phase is already included in the segment 1 time. Then after stopping, it starts accelerating for segment 2. So the transition from segment 1 to segment 2 is seamless: at the end of deceleration of segment 1, the lift is at rest at floor 10. Then immediately it starts accelerating for segment 2. So the total time is simply the sum of the two segment times. But is there any overlap? No, because they are sequential. So total time = 14 + 25 = 39 s.

But wait: Could there be a scenario where the lift does not need to decelerate to a full stop at floor 10? Actually, it must stop to let the person off. So it does come to rest. So our calculation seems correct.

But we should double-check: For segment 1, distance 45 m. The maximum speed is 5 m/s. The time to accelerate to 5 m/s is 5 s, covering 12.5 m. Then it travels at 5 m/s for some time t_c, then decelerates for 5 s covering 12.5 m. So total distance: 12.5 + 5*t_c + 12.5 = 25 + 5*t_c = 45 => t_c = (45-25)/5 = 4 s. So total time: 5+4+5=14 s. Good.

For segment 2: distance 100 m: 25 + 5*t_c = 100 => t_c = 75/5 = 15 s, total time: 5+15+5=25 s. Sum = 39 s.

But is there any possibility that the lift might not reach max speed on the second segment because it starts from rest? No, because it has 100 m, which is more than 25 m, so it will reach max speed.

Thus answer for Q2: 39 seconds.

But wait: The question says: "How long does it take?" Possibly meaning the total time from ground floor to the final destination (floor 30) including the stop at floor 10? That is what we computed.

Now Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Interpretation: Both get on at ground floor (floor 1). One wants to go to floor 40. The other wants to go to some other floor (not 40). The lift must stop at that other floor (between 1 and 40, excluding 40? Actually "another floor between 1/F and 40/F" means some floor other than 40, and presumably other than 1? But it says "stop at another floor", so it must stop at at least one intermediate floor before reaching 40. The second person gets off at that intermediate floor. So the lift goes from floor 1 to some floor k (where k is between 2 and 39 inclusive), stops to let second person off, then continues to floor 40. We want the minimum total time from floor 1 to floor 40, given that it must stop at some intermediate floor. So we need to choose the intermediate floor k such that the total travel time (from 1 to k plus from k to 40) is minimized. But note: The lift starts at floor 1, goes to k, stops (so it decelerates to stop at k), then from k it accelerates to go to 40 and decelerates to stop at 40. So total time = time(1->k) + time(k->40). But careful: When going from 1 to k, the lift starts at rest at 1, and ends at rest at k. Similarly from k to 40, starts at rest at k, ends at rest at 40. So we need to compute for each possible k (integer floor from 2 to 39) the total time, and find the minimum.

But note: The distances: from floor 1 to floor k: d1 = (k-1)*5 meters. From floor k to floor 40: d2 = (40-k)*5 meters.

For each segment, if the distance is greater than 25 m, then it will have acceleration, constant speed, deceleration. If less than or equal to 25 m, then it might not reach max speed, and the motion is triangular: accelerate to some peak speed then decelerate, with no constant speed phase. But since acceleration and deceleration are both 1 m/s^2, for a distance d, if d <= 25 m, then the maximum speed reached is sqrt(a*d) actually? Wait: For a triangular motion (accelerate then decelerate with same magnitude), the distance covered is: s = (1/2)*a*t1^2 + (1/2)*a*t2^2? Actually if it accelerates from 0 to v_max over time t_acc, then decelerates from v_max to 0 over time t_dec, with a=1, then distance during acceleration: (1/2)*a*t_acc^2, and during deceleration: v_max*t_dec - (1/2)*a*t_dec^2. But if t_acc = t_dec (since symmetric), then v_max = a*t_acc, and total distance = 2*(1/2)*a*t_acc^2 = a*t_acc^2. But also v_max^2 = a^2*t_acc^2, so t_acc = v_max/a, and distance = a*(v_max/a)^2 = v_max^2/a. So if the distance d is given, and we want to minimize time, we would accelerate as much as possible? Actually if d is small, we might not reach max speed. The time for a triangular motion with peak speed v (where v <= v_max) is: t_acc = v/a, t_dec = v/a, total time = 2v/a, and distance = v^2/a. So given d, the minimum time is achieved by using the maximum possible v? But if d is small, v is determined by d: v = sqrt(a*d). Then time = 2*sqrt(d/a). But if d is large enough that v would exceed v_max, then we cap at v_max, and then we have a constant speed phase. So for a segment of distance d, the time is:
If d <= v_max^2/a = 25 m, then time = 2*sqrt(d/a) = 2*sqrt(d) since a=1.
If d > 25 m, then time = (v_max/a) + (d - v_max^2/a)/v_max + (v_max/a) = 2*(v_max/a) + (d - v_max^2/a)/v_max = 2*5 + (d-25)/5 = 10 + (d-25)/5 = (d-25)/5 + 10 = d/5 + 10 - 5 = d/5 + 5? Wait compute: 10 + (d-25)/5 = 10 + d/5 - 5 = d/5 + 5. So for d > 25, time = d/5 + 5 seconds.
Check: For d=45, time = 45/5 + 5 = 9+5=14, matches earlier. For d=100, time=100/5+5=20+5=25, matches. For d=25 exactly, both formulas give: triangular: 2*sqrt(25)=10, and constant speed formula: 25/5+5=5+5=10, so consistent.

So we have a piecewise function: T(d) = { 2*sqrt(d) if d <= 25; d/5 + 5 if d > 25 }.

Now total time T_total = T(d1) + T(d2), where d1 = 5*(k-1), d2 = 5*(40-k). And k is an integer from 2 to 39.

We want to minimize T_total over k.

But note: d1 and d2 are both multiples of 5. And d1 + d2 = total distance from 1 to 40 = 195 m, constant. So d2 = 195 - d1.

So T_total = T(d1) + T(195-d1). We need to minimize this over d1 = 5*(k-1) for k=2,...,39, so d1 ranges from 5 (k=2) to 5*39=195? Actually k=39 gives d1=5*(39-1)=5*38=190, and d2=5. So d1 from 5 to 190 in steps of 5.

But careful: k=40 is not allowed because that is the final floor, and we need an intermediate stop. So k from 2 to 39 inclusive.

Now we need to consider the function f(d) = T(d) + T(195-d). Since T is defined piecewise, we need to consider different regimes for d.

First, note that 195 is much larger than 25. So for d1, if d1 <= 25, then T(d1)=2*sqrt(d1). And d2 = 195-d1, which is > 25 (since 195-25=170>25), so T(d2)= d2/5 + 5. Similarly, if d1 > 25, then T(d1)= d1/5+5, and d2 = 195-d1. But d2 could be <=25 or >25. Since d1 >25, then d2 = 195-d1 < 170. But d2 might be <=25 if d1 >= 170? Actually if d1 >= 170, then d2 <= 25. So we have three cases:
Case 1: d1 <= 25 and d2 > 25 (which is automatic if d1 <=25 because d2=195-d1 >=170>25). So for d1 from 5 to 25 (in steps of 5), T_total = 2*sqrt(d1) + ( (195-d1)/5 + 5 ) = 2*sqrt(d1) + (195-d1)/5 + 5.
Case 2: d1 > 25 and d2 > 25. That means d1 >25 and 195-d1 >25 => d1 < 170. So d1 from 30 to 165 (since steps of 5, and d1>25 means d1>=30, and d1<170 means d1<=165). Then T_total = (d1/5+5) + ((195-d1)/5+5) = (d1 + 195 - d1)/5 + 10 = 195/5 + 10 = 39 + 10 = 49? Wait: 195/5 = 39, plus 10 = 49
