Okay, let's see. I need to make 24 using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8. Each number has to be used exactly once, right? Let me think of different combinations.

First, maybe multiplication and division could help. 24 is a multiple of many numbers, so perhaps 8 times 3 is 24. But then I have 4 and 1 left. If I do 8 * 3 = 24, but I need to use 4 and 1 somehow. Maybe subtract or add them? Wait, 8*3 is 24, but if I do 8*3*(something with 4 and 1), but that might overshoot. Alternatively, 8*(3 - (1/4))? Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, 3 - 0.25 is 2.75, 8*2.75 is 22, which isn't 24. Hmm.

Wait, maybe (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4*4=16. No, that's what the example tried. Not enough.

What if I do 4 * 3 * (8 - 1)? Wait, 8-1 is 7, 4*3*7=84. Way too big.

How about 8 * (4 - (3 - 1))? Let's compute inside: 3-1=2, 4-2=2, 8*2=16. Still no.

Wait, maybe division. Like 8/(1 - (3/4)). Let's check denominator: 3/4 is 0.75, 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. Then 8 / 0.25 = 32. Not 24.

Wait, another approach: 3 * 8 =24. If I can make the other numbers cancel out. Like 3*8*(4-4), but we don't have two 4s. Wait, numbers are 4,3,1,8. So 3*8=24, but need to use 4 and 1. Maybe 3*8 +4 -4, but we don't have two 4s. Wait, perhaps (3*8) * (4/4) but again, only one 4. Hmm.

Wait, maybe (8 - (4/1)) * 3. Let's see: 4/1 is 4, 8-4=4, 4*3=12. Not enough.

What if (8 * 3) * (1) +4? That's 24 +4=28. No.

Wait, 8 * (3 + (1 - 4))? 1-4 is -3, 3 + (-3)=0. 8*0=0. Not good.

How about 4 * (8 - (3 - 1))? 3-1=2, 8-2=6, 4*6=24. Wait, let's check the numbers used: 4,8,3,1. Yes! Each exactly once. Let me verify:

8 - (3 - 1) = 8 -2 =6. Then 4 *6=24. So the expression is 4*(8 - (3 -1)) =24.

Wait, but let's write it properly. 4 × (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 × (8 -2) =4×6=24. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 4,8,3,1. Each once. Let me check again.

Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1. Yes. The operations: subtract 1 from 3, subtract that result from 8, multiply by 4. So 4*(8 - (3 -1)) =24. That should work.

Wait, but let me check the order of operations. Parentheses first: 3-1=2. Then 8-2=6. 4*6=24. Perfect. So this should be correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user's example had attempts where they checked if numbers were used correctly. Let me make sure I didn't repeat any numbers. The numbers given are 4,3,1,8. In this expression, each is used once. So yes.

Wait, but maybe another way. Let me think if there's another possible combination. For example, (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) was tried but gives 16. What about (8 / (4 - (3 - 1)))? Let's see: 3-1=2, 4-2=2, 8/2=4. Not 24.

Alternatively, 3 * (8 - (4 / 1)). 4/1=4, 8-4=4, 3*4=12. No.

Wait, another idea: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1). 12 *2=24. Wait, 4+8=12, 3-1=2, 12*2=24. Oh! That's simpler. Let's check numbers: 4,8,3,1. All used once. Yes!

Wait, this seems better. So (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 =24. Let me verify:

4 +8 =12, 3-1=2. Multiply them: 12*2=24. Perfect. And all numbers used exactly once. So why didn't I think of this earlier?

Wait, so this expression works. Let me check again. Numbers: 4,8,3,1. Each used once. Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication. Yes.

So the correct expression is (4 + 8) × (3 - 1) =24.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. 4+8 is 12, 3-1 is 2. 12*2=24. Yes. That's correct.

So why did the previous attempt with 4*(8 - (3-1)) also work? Both expressions are valid. But the second one is simpler.

Wait, but the problem says "construct a mathematical expression". Either would work, but perhaps the second one is better.

Wait, let me check if the user's example had similar attempts. The user's third attempt was 4*(8-3)+4 which used two 4s, which was invalid.

So in this case, (4 +8)*(3 -1) uses all numbers once. Let me confirm:

4, 8, 3, 1. Yes. Each exactly once.

So this should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check again. 4+8=12, 3-1=2. 12*2=24. Correct.

Yes, this works. So the answer should be (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) =24.

Wait, but let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, order of operations. If written without parentheses, but in this case, the parentheses are necessary. So as written with parentheses, it's correct.

Another check: 4+8 is 12, 3-1 is 2. Multiply gives 24. Perfect.

So this should be the correct expression.

Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), all exactly once. Correct!
