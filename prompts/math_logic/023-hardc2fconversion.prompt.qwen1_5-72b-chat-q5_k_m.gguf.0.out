"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

The statement you mentioned is a simple conversion rule to remember how to convert temperatures from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) approximately. According to this rule, for every 12 degrees Celsius, you can invert the digits to get an approximate temperature in Fahrenheit.

Here's how it works:

1. Take any temperature in Celsius.
2. Divide that temperature by 12.
3. Invert the digits (swap the positions of the first and second digits).

Let's go through a couple of examples:

Example 1:
- Celsius temperature: 24°C
- Divide by 12: 24 ÷ 12 = 2
- Invert the digits: 2 becomes 20
- The approximate Fahrenheit temperature: 24°C ≈ 75°F (实际转换为 75.2°F)

Example 2:
- Celsius temperature: 36°C
- Divide by 12: 36 ÷ 12 = 3
- Invert the digits: 3 becomes 30
- The approximate Fahrenheit temperature: 36°C ≈ 95°F (实际转换为 95°F, 这次非常接近实际值，因为36°C转换到Fahrenheit正好是95°F)

Please note that this is a rough estimation method, and the actual conversion formula is:
°F = (°C × 1.8) + 32

In the examples above, the inverted digit method gives a reasonable approximation, but it's not exact. For precise conversions, use the actual formula.
