The phrase: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

We need to interpret this. It seems like a mnemonic or a trick for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" suggests that if you take a Celsius temperature, add 12, then invert the digits (i.e., reverse the order of the digits), you get the Fahrenheit temperature. But is that correct? Let's test.

Celsius to Fahrenheit formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

If we take a Celsius temperature C, then F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

The phrase "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" might be a rough approximation. Let's see if adding 12 to C and then inverting digits approximates the conversion.

Take C = 0°C. F = 32°F. Inverting digits of 0? 0 inverted is 0. Not 32. So maybe it's not exactly that.

Maybe it's about the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit for every 12°C interval. Let's see: For every 12°C increase, Fahrenheit increases by (12 * 9/5) = 21.6°F. That's not a round number. But maybe the phrase is about the digits of the Celsius temperature being reversed after adding 12? Let's test with some examples.

Take C = 10°C. F = (10 * 9/5) + 32 = 18 + 32 = 50°F. Inverting digits of 10 gives 01 = 1. Not 50.

Take C = 20°C. F = (20 * 9/5) + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F. Inverting digits of 20 gives 02 = 2. Not 68.

Take C = 30°C. F = (30 * 9/5) + 32 = 54 + 32 = 86°F. Inverting digits of 30 gives 03 = 3. Not 86.

So that doesn't work.

Maybe it's about the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit for each 12°C interval: For every 12°C, the Fahrenheit equivalent is 21.6°F, which is roughly 22°F. So maybe the phrase is about adding 12°C to get a Fahrenheit temperature that is roughly 22°F higher? But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the fact that 0°C = 32°F, 12°C = 53.6°F, 24°C = 75.2°F, etc. The digits of 12°C (1 and 2) inverted become 21, which is close to 53.6? No.

Wait, maybe it's about the fact that 0°C = 32°F, 12°C = 53.6°F, 24°C = 75.2°F, 36°C = 96.8°F, 48°C = 118.4°F, etc. The digits of the Celsius temperature are reversed? For 12°C, digits are 1 and 2, reversed is 21. But 21°F is not 53.6°F. So no.

Maybe it's about the fact that 0°C = 32°F, 12°C = 53.6°F, 24°C = 75.2°F, 36°C = 96.8°F, 48°C = 118.4°F, 60°C = 140°F, etc. The digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are reversed? For 12°C, Fahrenheit is 53.6, digits 5,3,6 reversed is 653? Not 12.
