To solve these problems, we need to consider the motion of the lift, which involves acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration phases. Let's break down each question:

### 1. Time to travel from the ground floor to the top floor (40/F)

**Total distance to travel:**
- The building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall.
- Total height = 40 floors × 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

**Lift motion:**
- Acceleration = 1 m/s²
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s

**Phases of motion:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Final speed \( v = 5 \) m/s
   - Initial speed \( u = 0 \) m/s
   - Acceleration \( a = 1 \) m/s²
   - Using \( v = u + at \), we find \( t = \frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{5 - 0}{1} = 5 \) seconds.
   - Distance covered during acceleration \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \) meters.

2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Similar to acceleration, time \( t = 5 \) seconds, and distance \( s = 12.5 \) meters.

3. **Constant speed phase:**
   - Total distance for acceleration and deceleration = \( 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \) meters.
   - Remaining distance = \( 200 - 25 = 175 \) meters.
   - Time at constant speed = \( \frac{175}{5} = 35 \) seconds.

**Total time:**
- Acceleration time + Constant speed time + Deceleration time = \( 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \) seconds.

### 2. Time for two people (one to 10/F, another to 30/F)

**Distance to 10/F:**
- Height = 10 floors × 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.

**Phases of motion to 10/F:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

3. **Constant speed phase:**
   - Remaining distance = \( 50 - 25 = 25 \) meters.
   - Time = \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) seconds.

**Total time to 10/F:**
- \( 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \) seconds.

**Distance to 30/F:**
- Height = 30 floors × 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.

**Phases of motion to 30/F:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

3. **Constant speed phase:**
   - Remaining distance = \( 150 - 25 = 125 \) meters.
   - Time = \( \frac{125}{5} = 25 \) seconds.

**Total time to 30/F:**
- \( 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \) seconds.

**Overall time for both:**
- The lift travels to 10/F in 15 seconds, stops, then continues to 30/F.
- Additional time from 10/F to 30/F:
  - Distance = 100 meters.
  - Acceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
  - Deceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
  - Constant speed phase: \( \frac{100 - 25}{5} = 15 \) seconds.
- Additional time = \( 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \) seconds.

**Total time:**
- \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) seconds.

### 3. Minimum time to 40/F with a stop

**Strategy:**
- Stop at the floor closest to 40/F that allows the lift to minimize time.

**Optimal stop:**
- Stop at 39/F (just before 40/F).

**Phases of motion to 39/F:**
1. **Acceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

2. **Deceleration phase:**
   - Time = 5 seconds, distance = 12.5 meters.

3. **Constant speed phase:**
   - Remaining distance to 39/F = \( 195 - 25 = 170 \) meters.
   - Time = \( \frac{170}{5} = 34 \) seconds.

**Time to 39/F:**
- \( 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \) seconds.

**Additional time to 40/F:**
- Distance = 5 meters.
- Acceleration phase: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) seconds (since \( s = \frac{1}{2}at^2 \) and \( s = 5 \)).
- Deceleration phase: 2.5 seconds.

**Total additional time:**
- \( 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 \) seconds.

**Total minimum time:**
- \( 44 + 5 = 49 \) seconds.

Thus, the answers are:
1. 45 seconds
2. 40 seconds
3. 49 seconds [end of text]
