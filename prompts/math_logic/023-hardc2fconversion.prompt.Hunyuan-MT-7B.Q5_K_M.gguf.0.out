This statement means that there is a simple rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. For every 12 degrees Celsius (°C) increase, the corresponding Fahrenheit (°F) value decreases by 6 degrees. In other words, if you want to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and then subtract 32.

Here’s an example to illustrate this:

Let’s say you have a temperature of 20°C. To convert it to Fahrenheit, you can use the formula:

°F = (C × 9/5) - 32

Plugging in the value of 20°C, you get:

°F = (20 × 9/5) - 32
°F = 36 - 32
°F = 4

So, 20°C is equivalent to 4°F.

Another example:

Suppose you have a temperature of 35°C. To convert it to Fahrenheit, you can use the same formula:

°F = (35 × 9/5) - 32
°F = 63 - 32
°F = 31

Therefore, 35°C is equivalent to 31°F.

This rule makes it easier to remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit because the relationship between the two temperature scales is consistent and follows a simple pattern. [end of text]
