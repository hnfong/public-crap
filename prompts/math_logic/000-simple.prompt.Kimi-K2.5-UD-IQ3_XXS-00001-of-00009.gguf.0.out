Here are my answers:

**Q1:** 1+1 = **2**

**Q2:** 6*7 = **42**

**Q3:** 83*59 = **4,897**

**Q4:** 349*683 = **238,367**

**Q5:** 6043*7489 = **45,256,027**

**Q6:** 3x + 7 = 22 → 3x = 15 → **x = 5**

**Q7:** 25% of 80 = **20**

**Q8:** You gave: $20 + $20 + $5 = $45. Book costs $15. Change = $45 - $15 = **$30**

**Q9:** Perimeter = 4 × 5 = **20 units**

**Q10:** I am not sure, but I think the answer is **4** (Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister), assuming all are children of the same mother with no other children.

**Q11:** 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = **5** (following order of operations)

**Q12:** I am not sure, but I think the answer is **6** (assuming Tom also needs a slice, so 5 guests + Tom = 6), or possibly **5** if Tom doesn't eat cake, or another number depending on slice size. The problem doesn't specify slice size or whether Tom counts.

**Q13:** 20% off $25 = $5 discount. Sale price = **$20**

**Q14:** From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours 45 minutes = **165 minutes**

**Q15:** 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5, so you need **6 taxis** (rounding up since you can't have a fraction of a taxi)

**Q16:** 180 - 31 - 62 = **87 degrees** [end of text]
