### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**

The number **120** is significant for several reasons in mathematics, culture, and other fields. Here are some of its interesting properties:

1. **Factorial of 5**:  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $  
   So, 120 is the factorial of 5.

2. **Number of permutations of 5 distinct items**:  
   The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct items is $ 5! = 120 $.

3. **Number of seconds in a day**:  
   A day has 24 hours, each hour has 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds.  
   $ 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86,400 $ seconds in a day.  
   However, 120 is not directly related to this, but it is a common number in many contexts.

4. **Number of combinations**:  
   $ \binom{10}{5} = 252 $, but $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $, and $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $, and $ \binom{7}{3} = 35 $, and $ \binom{8}{3} = 56 $, and $ \binom{9}{3} = 84 $, and $ \binom{10}{3} = 120 $.  
   So, 120 is the number of ways to choose 3 items from 10.

5. **Number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices**:  
   A complete graph with $ n $ vertices has $ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} $ edges.  
   For $ n = 5 $, $ \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10 $, but for $ n = 6 $, $ \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15 $, and for $ n = 10 $, $ \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = 45 $, and for $ n = 12 $, $ \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66 $, and for $ n = 15 $, $ \frac{15 \times 14}{2} = 105 $, and for $ n = 16 $, $ \frac{16 \times 15}{2} = 120 $.  
   So, 120 is the number of edges in a complete graph with 16 vertices.

6. **Number of ways to arrange 5 people in a circle**:  
   The number of ways to arrange $ n $ people in a circle is $ (n-1)! $.  
   For $ n = 5 $, $ (5-1)! = 4! = 24 $, but for $ n = 6 $, $ (6-1)! = 120 $.  
   So, 120 is the number of ways to arrange 6 people in a circle.

**Conclusion**:  
The number 120 is significant in mathematics as it is the factorial of 5, the number of ways to arrange 6 people in a circle, and has many other interesting properties in combinatorics and number theory.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Answer:**

We are given the quadratic equation:  
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
$$

We can solve this using the **quadratic formula**:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Where $ a = 1 $, $ b = -7 $, and $ c = -18 $.

**Step 1**: Plug in the values into the formula:

$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)}
$$

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}
$$

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

**Step 2**: Solve for both values of $ x $:

- $ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $
- $ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $

**Conclusion**:  
The solutions to the equation are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Answer:**

We are given:
- Distance between the two cities = 200 km
- Speed of the train = 60 km/h
- Time in a full day = 24 hours

**Step 1**: Calculate the time it takes for the train to travel one way:

$$
\text{Time for one way} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.333 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 2**: Calculate the time for a round trip (to and from):

$$
\text{Time for round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.666 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 3**: Calculate how many round trips the train can make in 24 hours:

$$
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train cannot make a partial trip, we take the **floor** of the result.

**Conclusion**:  
The train can make **3 full round trips** in a full day.
