Give the answer for all these questions. Provide steps. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..."

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the time spent on the train and the distance traveled. Since the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, we can use the formula for average speed:

Average Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is 200 km and the time is 200 hours.

Average Speed = 200 km / 200 hours = 1 km/hour

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the train:

Time Spent on the Train = Distance / Average Speed
Time Spent on the Train = 200 km / 1 km/hour
Time Spent on the Train = 200 hours

So, the train can make 200 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
