I'll do my best to answer the questions. Here are the answers:

Q1: 1+1 = 2
Q2: 6*7 = 42
Q3: 83*59 = 4897
Q4: 349*683 = 238267
Q5: 6043*7489 = 45247567
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we need to isolate x. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives 3x = 15, and then dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you 20 + 20 - 15 - 5 = 20 dollars as change.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 5 * 4 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 4 children: Katherine and her 2 brothers and 1 sister.
Q11: Evaluating the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). Dividing 12 by 4 gives 3, so the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: Assuming each guest needs one slice of cake, 5 guests need 5 slices of cake.
Q13: The sale price of the shirt is 25 - (20% of 25) = 25 - 5 = 20 dollars.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. Converting this to minutes gives 2 * 60 + 45 = 165 minutes.
Q15: To find the number of taxis needed, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a taxi, we round up to the nearest whole number, so 6 taxis are needed.
Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's call the third angle x. Then, 31 + 62 + x = 180. Subtracting 93 from both sides gives x = 87 degrees.

I hope I got all the answers correct! [end of text]
