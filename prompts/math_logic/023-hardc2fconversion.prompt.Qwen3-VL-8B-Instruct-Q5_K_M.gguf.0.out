Actually, that statement — “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” — is **not accurate** as a general rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. It’s a **misleading or incorrect shortcut**, and I should clarify that to avoid confusion.

### ❌ Why the statement is misleading:

The phrase “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” suggests that if you take a Celsius temperature, add 12, and then invert the digits (swap them), you’ll get the Fahrenheit temperature — which is **not true**.

Let’s test it with a few examples.

---

### 🚫 Example 1: 12°C

- Inverting digits of 12 → 21
- But 12°C in Fahrenheit is:  
  **F = (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F**  
  → Not 21°F. ❌

---

### 🚫 Example 2: 20°C

- Inverting digits of 20 → 02 → 2  
- 20°C = (20 × 9/5) + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F  
  → Not 2°F. ❌

---

### 🚫 Example 3: 32°C

- Inverting digits → 23  
- 32°C = (32 × 9/5) + 32 = 57.6 + 32 = 89.6°F  
  → Not 23°F. ❌

---

### ✅ What *is* a correct way to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?

Use the formula:

> **F = (C × 9/5) + 32**

Or, if you want a rough mental estimate:

> **F ≈ C × 2 + 30** (for quick approximations — works well for temperatures around room temp)

---

### 🧠 Why might someone think this “inversion” trick works?

It might be a **misremembered or misinterpreted rule** — perhaps someone noticed that for *some* temperatures, the digits are close to inverted, but it’s coincidental.

For example:

- 18°C → 64.4°F → digits 18 vs 81? Not close.
- 25°C → 77°F → 25 vs 52? No.
- 37°C → 98.6°F → 37 vs 73? No.

Actually, **no common Celsius temperature has an inverted digit Fahrenheit equivalent**.

---

### ✅ Correct takeaway:

> ❌ “Every 12°C, the digits are inverted” — is **not a valid or accurate conversion rule**.  
> ✅ Use the formula: **F = (C × 9/5) + 32**

---

### 🎯 Bonus: A *real* trick that *sometimes* works (but not for 12°C)

There’s a **very rough approximation** that works for some temperatures:

> **F ≈ C × 2 + 30**

- 0°C → 30°F (actual: 32°F) → close
- 10°C → 50°F (actual: 50°F) → exact!
- 20°C → 70°F (actual: 68°F) → close
- 30°C → 90°F (actual: 86°F) → close

But this is **not digit inversion**, and it’s not exact.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> The statement “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” is **false**. It’s a misleading or incorrect shortcut. Celsius and Fahrenheit are not related by digit inversion. Use the formula **F = (C × 9/5) + 32** for accurate conversion.

I apologize if my initial answer was unclear — I’ve now corrected it with examples and explanations. [end of text]
