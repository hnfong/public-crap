<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer all three questions. Provide steps.

We have building 40 stories, each floor 5 meters tall. So total height from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F) is (40-1)*5? Wait ground floor is 1/F. Usually floor numbers start at 1. So distance from floor 1 to floor 40 is (40-1)*5 = 39*5 = 195 meters. But maybe they consider ground floor as floor 0? They said ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F). So floor numbers 1 to 40 inclusive. So distance between floor 1 and floor 40 is 39 intervals of 5 m each = 195 m. However some might think ground floor is floor 0 and top floor is floor 40, giving 40*5 = 200 m. Let's examine typical building: 40 story building, each floor 5 m tall. Usually floor count includes ground floor as floor 1, top floor as floor 40. So there are 39 intervals between them. But they might treat ground floor as floor 0 (0/F) and top floor as 40/F, giving 40 intervals. The problem statement: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So they explicitly say ground floor is 1/F. So distance = (40-1)*5 = 195 m. We'll adopt that.

Now elevator motion: acceleration/deceleration 1 m/s^2, max speed 5 m/s. So typical elevator motion: accelerate at 1 m/s^2 until reaching max speed 5 m/s, then cruise at constant speed, then decelerate at -1 m/s^2 to stop at target floor.

We need to compute travel time for given distances.

First compute distance needed to accelerate from rest to max speed at 1 m/s^2: v = a t => t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 s. Distance covered during acceleration: s_acc = 0.5 a t^2 = 0.5 * 1 * 5^2 = 0.5 * 25 = 12.5 m. Similarly deceleration distance same: 12.5 m. So total distance needed for full accel+decel phases = 25 m. If total travel distance D > 25 m, then there will be a cruise segment at max speed. If D <= 25 m, then the elevator never reaches max speed; it will accelerate then decelerate symmetrically, reaching a peak speed less than max.

Now compute for each scenario.

1. From ground floor to top floor: D = 195 m > 25 m, so there will be cruise.

Cruise distance = D - 25 = 195 - 25 = 170 m.

Cruise time = distance / speed = 170 / 5 = 34 s.

Total time = t_acc + t_cruise + t_decel = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 s.

But we also need to consider door opening/closing times? Not mentioned, ignore.

Thus answer for Q1: 44 seconds.

Now Q2: Two people get on same lift on ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second to 30/F. So elevator must stop at floor 10 (first person) then continue to floor 30 (second). We need total time from start to when second person reaches floor 30? Or time for both to reach their floors? Usually ask "How long does it take?" meaning total time for lift to complete both trips, i.e., from ground floor to floor 10, stop, then to floor 30. So compute travel distances: ground to floor 10: distance = (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45 m. Then floor 10 to floor 30: distance = (30-10)*5 = 20*5 = 100 m.

We need to compute time for each segment, including stop time? Not given. We'll assume negligible stop time (doors open/close). But we might include a small dwell time; but not given, ignore.

Now compute time for 45 m segment.

Check if D=45 > 25, so there will be cruise.

Accelerate 12.5 m, decelerate 12.5 m, cruise distance = 45 - 25 = 20 m. Cruise time = 20/5 = 4 s. Total time = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 s.

Now second segment D=100 m > 25, cruise distance = 100 - 25 = 75 m. Cruise time = 75/5 = 15 s. Total time = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 s.

Total time = 14 + 25 = 39 s.

But we also need to consider that after stopping at floor 10, the elevator must accelerate again from rest. So we already accounted for that.

Thus answer for Q2: 39 seconds.

Now Q3: Two people get on same lift on ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming second person does not go to same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Interpretation: The lift must stop at some intermediate floor (not 40) before reaching top floor. The second person gets off at that intermediate floor. We need to find the optimal intermediate floor that minimizes total travel time to reach floor 40 (with a stop). So we need to choose a floor k (2 <= k <= 39) where the lift stops, then continues to 40. The total distance is same (ground to 40) but with an intermediate stop causing extra acceleration/deceleration phases. The optimal floor likely is such that the two segments each have distances that allow the elevator to reach max speed (or maybe not). Since the total distance is 195 m, and we have to split into two segments: D1 = (k-1)*5, D2 = (40 - k)*5. The total time = time(D1) + time(D2). We need to minimize over integer k.

We can treat D1 and D2 as distances; time function t(D) = if D >= 25: 5 + (D-25)/5 + 5 = (D/5) + 5? Wait compute: t = 5 + (D-25)/5 + 5 = (D-25)/5 + 10 = D/5 - 5 + 10 = D/5 + 5. Let's verify: D/5 + 5. For D >= 25. Indeed t(D) = D/5 + 5.

If D < 25, then the elevator never reaches max speed. Then we have symmetric accelerate then decelerate, reaching peak speed v_peak = sqrt(a D). Actually for distance D with constant acceleration a then deceleration -a, the time is t = 2 sqrt(D/a). Derivation: accelerate for t1, distance = 0.5 a t1^2, decelerate same distance, total D = a t1^2, so t1 = sqrt(D/a). Total time = 2 t1 = 2 sqrt(D/a). With a=1, t = 2 sqrt(D). So for D < 25, t(D) = 2 sqrt(D). Let's compute threshold: D=25 gives t = 2 sqrt(25) = 10 s. Using D/5 +5 gives 25/5+5=5+5=10 s. So function is continuous.

Thus t(D) = { D/5 + 5 for D >= 25; 2 sqrt(D) for D <= 25 }.

Now we need to minimize T(k) = t(D1) + t(D2) where D1 = (k-1)*5, D2 = (40 - k)*5.

We can treat k as integer from 2 to 39.

But we can also treat D1 variable continuous between 0 and 195.

Goal: minimize t(D1) + t(195 - D1). Since total distance fixed.

We can analyze function.

For D1 >= 25 and D2 >= 25, both segments use linear formula: t(D) = D/5 +5. Then total T = D1/5 +5 + D2/5 +5 = (D1 + D2)/5 +10 = 195/5 +10 = 39 +10 = 49 s. Wait 195/5 = 39. So T = 49 s. That's larger than direct travel time (44 s). So any stop where both segments >25 adds 5 seconds extra (since each segment adds 5 seconds overhead). Indeed each segment includes acceleration and deceleration overhead of 10 seconds total (5+5) vs continuous travel where acceleration and deceleration only once each (10 seconds total). So the extra overhead is 10 seconds (since we have two acceleration phases and two deceleration phases vs one each). Actually direct travel had 5+5 =10 seconds overhead. With a stop we have 5+5 for first segment and 5+5 for second segment = 20 seconds overhead, but we also have cruise times that sum to same as before. So total extra 10 seconds.

But maybe we can reduce total time by choosing D1 small enough that first segment does not reach max speed, thus reducing overhead? Let's compute.

If D1 < 25, then t(D1) = 2 sqrt(D1). This may be less than D1/5 +5 for small D1. Let's compare.

Define f(D) = D/5 +5 - 2 sqrt(D). For D=0, f=5 >0. For D=25, f=10 - 10 =0. So for D between 0 and 25, D/5 +5 > 2 sqrt(D). So using the short segment reduces time compared to using linear formula. So we can reduce total time by making D1 small (or D2 small). However we also need D2 = 195 - D1, which will be > 170, definitely >25, so D2 uses linear formula.

Thus total time T(D1) = 2 sqrt(D1) + (D2/5 +5) where D2 = 195 - D1.

So T(D1) = 2 sqrt(D1) + (195 - D1)/5 +5.

Simplify: T(D1) = 2 sqrt(D1) + 39 - D1/5 +5 = 44 + 2 sqrt(D1) - D1/5.

We need to minimize for D1 in [0,25] (since D1 <25). Actually D1 can be up to 25; beyond that both segments linear, T = 49 constant? Wait for D1>25, T = D1/5 +5 + (195 - D1)/5 +5 = 49 constant. So for D1>25, T=49. For D1 <=25, T = 44 + 2 sqrt(D1) - D1/5.

We need to find minimum of this expression on [0,25].

Take derivative: dT/dD1 = (2 * (1/(2 sqrt(D1)))) - 1/5 = 1/ sqrt(D1) - 0.2.

Set to zero: 1/ sqrt(D1) = 0.2 => sqrt(D1) = 5 => D1 = 25.

Interesting, the minimum occurs at D1 = 25 (the boundary). At D1=25, T = 44 + 2*5 - 25/5 = 44 +10 -5 = 49. Wait compute: 44 + 10 -5 = 49. That's same as constant for D1>25. So the function decreases from D1=0 to D1=25? Let's evaluate at D1=0: T = 44 + 0 - 0 = 44. Wait D1=0 means no first segment (stop at ground floor?), but we need a stop at another floor between 1 and 40, not ground floor. D1=0 corresponds to k=1 (ground floor) which is not allowed. So D1 must be at least 5? Actually floor numbers start at 1, so the first possible stop is floor 2 (k=2). D1 = (2-1)*5 = 5 m. That's >0.

Let's compute T at D1=5: T = 44 + 2 sqrt(5) - 5/5 = 44 + 2*2.23607 -1 = 44 + 4.4721 -1 = 47.4721 s.

At D1=10: sqrt(10)=3.1623, 2*sqrt=6.3249, D1/5=2, T=44+6.3249-2=48.3249 s.

At D1=15: sqrt=3.873, 2*sqrt=7.746, D1/5=3, T=44+7.746-3=48.746 s.

At D1=20: sqrt=4.472, 2*sqrt=8.944, D1/5=4, T=44+8.944-4=48.944 s.

At D1=25: T=49.

Thus the minimum occurs at smallest D1 allowed (i.e., smallest distance to first stop) because T decreases as D1 decreases (since derivative positive? Actually derivative at D1 small: 1/sqrt(D1) large >0.2, so derivative positive? Wait derivative = 1/ sqrt(D1) - 0.2. For D1 small, 1/ sqrt(D1) large >0.2, derivative positive, meaning T increasing with D1? Let's compute: At D1=5, derivative = 1/ sqrt(5) -0.2 = 0.447 -0.2 =0.247 >0, so T increasing as D1 increases. So minimum at smallest D1 (close to 0). So the optimal stop is as close as possible to ground floor (but not ground floor). So the minimum time is achieved by stopping at floor 2 (5 m up). Let's compute exact time for D1=5 m.

Segment 1 distance 5 m (<25). Use t1 = 2 sqrt(D1) = 2 sqrt(5) seconds.

Segment 2 distance D2 = 195 - 5 = 190 m (>25). Use t2 = D2/5 +5 = 190/5 +5 = 38 +5 = 43 s.

Total time = 2 sqrt(5) + 43 = 43 + 2*2.23607 = 43 + 4.4721 = 47.4721 s.

But we also need to consider that after stopping at floor 2, the elevator must decelerate to zero, then accelerate again. The time for deceleration and acceleration are already accounted in the segment times (each segment includes its own acceleration and deceleration). However there is also a dwell time for doors opening/closing. Not given, ignore.

Thus minimum time is about 47.47 seconds, achieved by stopping at floor 2 (or floor 39 symmetrical). But we must ensure second person does not go to floor 40, but can go to any other floor. So we can choose floor 2 (or floor 39) whichever yields same distance 5 m from ground or 5 m from top? Let's compute floor 39: D1 = (39-1)*5 = 38*5 = 190 m, D2 = 5 m. That would give same total time (since symmetrical). So min time is 47.47 s.

But we need to verify if there is any possibility of D1 < 5? Not allowed because floor numbers are integer. So floor 2 is minimal.

Thus answer for Q3: Minimum time ≈ 47.5 seconds (or 47.47 s). Provide steps.

Now we should present all steps clearly.

Let's also compute times for Q2 more precisely: For D=45 m, t = D/5 +5 = 45/5 +5 = 9+5=14 s (since D>25). For D=100 m, t = 100/5 +5 = 20+5=25 s. Total 39 s.

Now we can produce final answer.

Potential nuance: If we consider floor 1 to floor 40 distance 200 m (if ground floor is 0). Let's test alternative: D_total = 200 m. Then Q1 time: D>25, t = D/5 +5 = 200/5 +5 = 40+5=45 s? Wait compute: t = D/5 +5 = 200/5 +5 = 40+5 =45 s. But earlier we got 44 s. So difference 1 s. Which is correct? Let's compute using earlier method: accelerate 12.5 m, decelerate 12.5 m, cruise distance = 200-25=175 m, cruise time = 175/5=35 s, total = 5+35+5=45 s. So 45 s. So if total height 200 m, answer 45 s. Which is more plausible? Let's examine building: 40 story building each floor 5 m tall. Usually height from ground floor to top floor is 40*5 = 200 m (if ground floor is floor 0). But they said ground floor (1/F). So maybe they treat floor 1 as ground floor, floor 40 as top floor, meaning there are 40 floors, each 5 m tall, total height 40*5 = 200 m. Wait but distance from floor 1 to floor 40 includes 39 intervals? Actually floor 1 is at height 0 (ground). Floor 2 is at 5 m, floor 3 at 10 m, ... floor 40 at 195 m? Let's compute: floor number n corresponds to height (n-1)*5. So floor 40 height = (40-1)*5 = 195 m. So total height = 195 m. So there are 39 intervals between floor 1 and floor 40. But there are 40 floors, each floor is 5 m tall, but the top floor's ceiling is at 200 m? Actually each floor's height is 5 m, meaning the distance between floor n and floor n+1 is 5 m. So from floor 1 to floor 2 is 5 m, etc. So from floor 1 to floor 40 is 39 intervals = 195 m. So the building's total height from ground to top floor is 195 m. So our earlier answer 44 s is correct.

But some might think there are 40 intervals (including ground to floor 1?). However they said ground floor is 1/F, so floor 1 is ground floor. So there is no floor 0. So we keep 195 m.

Now compute Q2 distances accordingly: floor 10 height = (10-1)*5 = 45 m, floor 30 height = (30-1)*5 = 145 m? Wait floor 30 height = (30-1)*5 = 145 m. So distance from floor 10 to floor 30 = 145 - 45 = 100 m (as we used). Good.

Now Q3: D_total = 195 m. D1 minimal = 5 m (floor 2). D2 = 190 m. Compute t2 = D2/5 +5 = 190/5 +5 = 38+5=43 s. t1 = 2 sqrt(5) = 4.4721 s. Total = 47.4721 s.

Now we can present answer.

Potential nuance: The elevator may need to decelerate to stop at floor 2, then accelerate again. The time for deceleration and acceleration are already accounted. However there may be a dwell time for doors; not given.

Thus final answer:

1. 44 s.

2. 39 s.

3. Minimum about 47.5 s, achieved by stopping at floor 2 (or floor 39). Provide reasoning.

Let's craft final answer with steps.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Data that are the same for all parts**

* Height of one floor : \(h =5\;{\rm m}\)  
* Acceleration (and deceleration) : \(a =1\;{\rm m\,s^{-2}}\)  
* Maximum speed : \(v_{\max}=5\;{\rm m\,s^{-1}}\)

When the lift starts from rest it accelerates at \(a\) until it reaches \(v_{\max}\).

\[
t_{\rm acc}= \frac{v_{\max}}{a}= \frac{5}{1}=5\;{\rm s}
\]

Distance covered while accelerating (the same while decelerating)

\[
s_{\rm acc}= \frac12 a t_{\rm acc}^{2}= \frac12 (1)(5)^2 =12.5\;{\rm m}
\]

Hence the distance needed for a full “accelerate‑cruise‑decelerate’’ trip is  

\[
s_{\rm acc}+s_{\rm dec}= 12.5+12.5 = 25\;{\rm m}
\]

If the total travel distance \(S\) is larger than \(25\;{\rm m}\) the lift will
reach the top speed, cruise for the remaining distance and then decelerate.
The travel time for a distance \(S\;(>25\;{\rm m})\) is therefore  

\[
t(S)=t_{\rm acc}+t_{\rm dec}+ \frac{S-25}{v_{\max}}
      =5+5+\frac{S-25}{5}= \frac{S}{5}+5\qquad (S\ge 25)
\]

If the distance is shorter than \(25\;{\rm m}\) the lift never reaches the
maximum speed; it simply accelerates and then decelerates symmetrically.
With constant acceleration \(a\),

\[
S = a t_1^{2}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad t_1=\sqrt{\frac{S}{a}}
\]

Total time \(t=2t_1\):

\[
t(S)=2\sqrt{S}\qquad (S\le 25)
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.  From the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)

Height of the building  

\[
S_{\rm tot}= (40-1)\times5 = 39\times5 = 195\;{\rm m}>25\;{\rm m}
\]

\[
t_{\rm 1}= \frac{195}{5}+5 = 39+5 = \boxed{44\ {\rm s}}
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.  Two stops: 1/F → 10/F → 30/F  

*Ground → 10/F*  

\[
S_{1}= (10-1)\times5 = 45\;{\rm m}>25\;{\rm m}
\]
\[
t_{1}= \frac{45}{5}+5 = 9+5 = 14\;{\rm s}
\]

*10/F → 30/F*  

\[
S_{2}= (30-10)\times5 = 20\times5 = 100\;{\rm m}>25\;{\rm m}
\]
\[
t_{2}= \frac{100}{5}+5 = 20+5 = 25\;{\rm s}
\]

Total time  

\[
t_{\rm 2}= t_{1}+t_{2}= 14+25 = \boxed{39\ {\rm s}}
\]

(door‑opening/closing times are ignored as they are not given.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  One compulsory intermediate stop (different from the 40/F floor)

Let the lift first stop at floor \(k\;(2\le k\le 39)\).

\[
S_{1}= (k-1)\times5,\qquad 
S_{2}= (40-k)\times5 = 195 - S_{1}
\]

Total travel time  

\[
T(k)= t(S_{1})+t(S_{2})
\]

*If both segments are longer than 25 m* (\(S_{1}\ge 25\) and \(S_{2}\ge 25\))

\[
T = \frac{S_{1}}{5}+5+\frac{S_{2}}{5}+5 = \frac{195}{5}+10 = 49\;{\rm s}
\]

*If the first segment is short (\(S_{1}<25\) m) while the second is long*  

\[
T = 2\sqrt{S_{1}} +\Bigl(\frac{S_{2}}{5}+5\Bigr)
   = 2\sqrt{S_{1}} +\frac{195-S_{1}}{5}+5
   = 44 + 2\sqrt{S_{1}} -\frac{S_{1}}{5}
\]

\(T\) decreases as \(S_{1}\) becomes smaller, so the minimum occurs for the
smallest possible \(S_{1}\), i.e. the first stop as close to the ground as
allowed: floor 2.

\[
S_{1}= (2-1)\times5 = 5\;{\rm m}
\]
\[
t_{1}=2\sqrt{5}= 2(2.23607)=4.4721\;{\rm s}
\]
\[
S_{2}=195-5 =190\;{\rm m}
\]
\[
t_{2}= \frac{190}{5}+5 = 38+5 = 43\;{\rm s}
\]

\[
\boxed{T_{\min}= 4.4721+43 \approx 47.5\ {\rm s}}
\]

(The same minimum is obtained by stopping at floor 39, which is 5 m below the
top floor.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
**Answers**

1. **44 s** to go from floor 1 to floor 40.  
2. **39 s** for the lift to stop at floor 10 and then at floor 30.  
3. The smallest possible travel time with one intermediate stop is **≈ 47.5 s**, achieved by stopping at the nearest floor to the start (floor 2, or symmetrically floor 39). [end of text]
