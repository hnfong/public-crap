Give the answer for the above questions. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..."
 1. 1+1=2
 2. 6*7=42
 3. 83*59=4897
 4. 349*683=238907
 5. 6043*7489=45229987
 6. Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
     3x = 22 - 7
     3x = 15
     x = 15 / 3
     x = 5
 7. What is 25% of 80?
     25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
 8. I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
     You gave the shopkeeper $40 + $5 = $45.
     The cost of the book is $15.
     The change should be $45 - $15 = $30.
 9. Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
     Perimeter = 4 * side length = 4 * 5 = 20 units
 10. Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
     Katherine + two brothers + one sister = 4 children
 11. Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
     According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), division is performed before addition and subtraction.
     3 + (12 รท 4) - 1
     3 + 3 - 1
     6 - 1
     5
 12. Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
     I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5 slices, assuming one slice per person.
 13. If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
     20% of $25 = 0.20 * 25 = $5
     Sale price = Original price - Discount = $25 - $5 = $20
 14. If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
     From 3:45 PM to 4:45 PM is 60 minutes.
     From 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM is 60 minutes.
     From 5:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 45 minutes.
     Total = 60 + 60 + 45 = 165 minutes
 15. A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
     22 รท 4 = 5 with a remainder of 2.
     Therefore, 6 taxis are needed (5 full taxis and 1 for the remaining 2 people).
 16. If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
     The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
     Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
