Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1 about the number 120. Hmm, I remember that 120 is a number with several mathematical properties. Let me think... First, it's a factorial, right? 5 factorial is 5×4×3×2×1 which equals 120. That's one property. Then, maybe it's a highly composite number? Yes, because it has a lot of divisors. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors, which is more than many numbers its size. Also, in geometry, a dodecahedron has 12 faces, but wait, maybe 120 is related to something else? Oh, the sum of the first 15 numbers? Wait, 1+2+...+15 is (15×16)/2 = 120. So that's another property. Also, in time, 120 minutes is 2 hours. Maybe there's something in chemistry? The atomic number for Unbinilium, but that's a hypothetical element. Or in history, like the 120 days of Sodom by de Sade, but that's more of a cultural reference. I should list the mathematical ones first.

Moving on to Q2: solving x² -7x -18 =0. To solve a quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax² +bx +c=0, so here a=1, b=-7, c=-18. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the numbers: discriminant is (-7)^2 -4*1*(-18) = 49 +72 = 121. The square root of 121 is 11. So x = [7 ±11]/2. That gives two solutions: (7+11)/2 =18/2=9 and (7-11)/2 =-4/2=-2. So the solutions are x=9 and x=-2. Let me check by plugging back in: 9² -7*9 -18 =81-63-18=0. And (-2)^2 -7*(-2)-18=4+14-18=0. Yep, that works.

Q3: The train travels 200 km between two cities at 60 km/h. A round trip is going there and back, so total distance per round trip is 400 km. Wait, no, actually, a round trip is going from city A to B and then back to A, so each way is 200 km, so total for a round trip is 400 km. The time taken for one round trip would be distance divided by speed. But since the speed is 60 km/h, time one way is 200/60 hours, so round trip is (200*2)/60 = 400/60 = 6.666... hours, which is 6 hours 40 minutes. Now, a full day is 24 hours. To find how many round trips can be made, divide 24 by the time per round trip. So 24 divided by (400/60). Alternatively, 24 * (60/400) = (24*60)/400. Let me compute that: 24*60=1440, 1440/400=3.6. So 3.6 round trips. But since you can't do a fraction of a trip, the answer would be 3 full round trips. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, time for one way is 200/60 = 3.333... hours (3h20m). So round trip is 6.666... hours (6h40m). 24 divided by 6.666... equals 3.6. So yes, 3 full round trips. But maybe the question allows partial trips? The problem says "how many round trips can it make within a full day", so probably they want the integer part, so 3. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me see another way: in 24 hours, the total time available is 24*60=1440 minutes. Each round trip takes 400 km at 60 km/h: time in minutes is (400/60)*60 = 400 minutes? Wait no, 400 km divided by 60 km/h is 400/60 hours, which is 6.666... hours, which is 400 minutes? Wait, no, 6.666 hours is 6*60 + 40 = 400 minutes. So each round trip takes 400 minutes. 1440 divided by 400 is 3.6. So yes, 3 full round trips. So the answer is 3. 

Wait, but maybe the question is considering that after the third round trip, there's remaining time but not enough for another full trip. So the answer is 3. That seems right. 

So putting all together, the answers with steps.

**Q1: Significance and Properties of 120**  
1. **Factorial**: 120 is 5 factorial (5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120).  
2. **Highly Composite Number**: It has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120), more than any smaller number.  
3. **Triangular Number**: The sum of the first 15 natural numbers: \(1 + 2 + \dots + 15 = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120\).  
4. **Geometry**: A dodecahedron (12-faced Platonic solid) has 120 edges if considering dual polyhedrons, but more directly, 120 is the number of degrees in a triangle’s angles (though this is a common misconception).  
5. **Cultural/Other**: 120 minutes = 2 hours; in chemistry, it’s the atomic number for the hypothetical element "Unbinilium."

**Q2: Solving \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)**  
**Step 1**: Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).  
Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -18\).  
**Step 2**: Compute the discriminant:  
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
\]  
**Step 3**: Take the square root of the discriminant:  
\[
\sqrt{121} = 11
\]  
**Step 4**: Plug into the formula:  
\[
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
\]  
**Solutions**:  
\[
x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2
\]  
**Verification**:  
- For \(x = 9\): \(9^2 - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0\).  
- For \(x = -2\): \((-2)^2 - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0\).

**Q3: Number of Round Trips in a Day**  
**Step 1**: Calculate time for one round trip.  
- Distance one way: 200 km.  
- Speed: 60 km/h.  
- Time one way: \(\frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3}\) hours ≈ 3.333 hours.  
- Round trip time: \(2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}\) hours ≈ 6.666 hours (6 hours 40 minutes).  

**Step 2**: Total time available in a day: 24 hours.  
**Step 3**: Divide total time by round-trip time:  
\[
\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
\]  
**Step 4**: Since partial trips aren’t counted, the answer is **3 full round trips**.  

---
