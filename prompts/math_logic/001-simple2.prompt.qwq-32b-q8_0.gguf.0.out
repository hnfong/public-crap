Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1 about the number 120. Hmm, I remember that 120 is a number with several mathematical properties. Let me think. First, it's a factorial number, right? 5 factorial is 5×4×3×2×1 which equals 120. That's one property. Then, maybe it's a highly composite number? I think that's a number with more divisors than any smaller number. Let me check: the divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors, which is a lot. So yes, it's a highly composite number. Also, in geometry, maybe it's related to the dodecahedron or icosahedron? Wait, a dodecahedron has 12 faces, and an icosahedron has 20 faces. Hmm, not sure if that's directly related. Alternatively, 120 is the sum of a pair of twin primes: 59 + 61 = 120? Wait, 59+61 is 120? Let me add: 59+60 is 119, so 59+61 is 120. Yeah, that works. Also, in base 10, 120 is the smallest number to appear 6 times in the Pascal's triangle. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. The rows of Pascal's triangle: row 10 has 1,10,45,120,210, etc. So 120 appears in row 10, maybe also in other rows? Not sure, but maybe that's a property. Also, in terms of time, 120 minutes is 2 hours, but not sure if that's interesting. Maybe in other contexts, like the 120-cell in 4D geometry? That's a regular polytope. Okay, so those are some properties. I should list a few of these.

Moving on to Q2: solving x² -7x -18 =0. To solve a quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax² + bx + c =0, so here a=1, b=-7, c=-18. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values: b² is (-7)^2 =49, 4ac is 4*1*(-18)= -72. So the discriminant is 49 - (-72)? Wait, no, discriminant is b² -4ac. Since 4ac is -72, then subtracting that would be adding 72. So discriminant is 49 +72 = 121. √121 is 11. So the solutions are [7 ±11]/2. So (7+11)/2 =18/2=9, and (7-11)/2= -4/2= -2. So the roots are 9 and -2. Alternatively, maybe factor the equation? Let's see: looking for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Hmm, factors of -18 could be  -9 and 2, because -9*2= -18 and -9 +2= -7. Yes, so the equation factors as (x -9)(x +2)=0, so x=9 or x=-2. That checks out.

Now Q3: A train traveling at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips can it make in a full day (24 hours)? First, need to find the time for a one-way trip. Distance is 200 km, speed 60 km/h, so time = distance/speed = 200/60 hours. That's 10/3 hours, which is about 3 hours 20 minutes. A round trip is going there and back, so double that time: 20/3 hours per round trip. Then total time available is 24 hours. So number of round trips is 24 divided by (20/3). Let me compute that: 24 ÷ (20/3) =24*(3/20)= (72)/20 = 3.6. Since you can't do a fraction of a round trip, the answer would be 3 full round trips. Wait, but let me check again. Let me do step by step:

One-way time: 200 km /60 km/h = 3.333... hours (exactly 10/3). Round trip is 20/3 hours ≈6.666... hours. So 24 divided by (20/3) is 24*(3/20)= (24/20)*3 = (6/5)*3 = 18/5 = 3.6. So 3 full round trips, and 0.6 of another. Since the question says "how many round trips can it make", it's the integer part, so 3. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the time for a round trip is 200*2 /60 =400/60=6.666... hours. So in 24 hours, 24 divided by 6.666... equals 3.6. So yes, 3 complete round trips. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe someone might think of the time as one way and back, so total time per round trip is 2*(200/60). So same as above. So the answer is 3. 

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. Suppose the train starts at city A, goes to B, then back to A, that's one round trip. The time taken for each direction is 200/60 hours. So each round trip is 400/60 = 6.666... hours. So in 24 hours, how many 6.666... hours fit? 24 divided by 6.666... equals 3.6. So 3 full round trips. The remaining 0.6 of a round trip isn't completed, so the answer is 3. That seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe someone might think of the time as one way trip time is 3h20m, so a round trip is 6h40m. 24 hours divided by 6h40m. Let's convert 6h40m to hours: 6 + 40/60 =6.666... hours. So same as before. So 24 /6.666...=3.6. So yeah, 3. 

Therefore, the answer is 3 round trips.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**  
**Answer:**  
The number 120 has several interesting mathematical properties:  
1. **Factorial**: \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).  
2. **Highly composite number**: It has 16 divisors (more than any smaller number), making it useful in many applications (e.g., time divisions like 60 minutes or 12 months).  
3. **Sum of twin primes**: \(59 + 61 = 120\).  
4. **Geometry**:  
   - A dodecahedron (12-faced Platonic solid) and an icosahedron (20-faced Platonic solid) relate to 120 in higher-dimensional geometry (e.g., the 120-cell, a 4D regular polytope).  
5. **Pascal’s Triangle**: 120 appears 6 times in Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., in row 10 as \(\binom{10}{3}\)).

**Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)**  
**Answer:**  
**Steps:**  
1. **Quadratic formula**: For \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), solutions are:  
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]  
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -18\).  
2. **Compute discriminant**:  
   \[
   (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]  
3. **Find roots**:  
   \[
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]  
   - \(x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9\)  
   - \(x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2\)  

**Final Answer:** \(x = 9\) or \(x = -2\).

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips can it make within a full day (24 hours)?**  
**Answer:**  
**Steps:**  
1. **Time for one-way trip**:  
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200\ \text{km}}{60\ \text{km/h}} = \frac{10}{3}\ \text{hours} \approx 3\ \text{hours}\ 20\ \text{minutes}.
   \]  
2. **Time for a round trip**:  
   \[
   2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}\ \text{hours} \approx 6\ \text{hours}\ 40\ \text{minutes}.
   \]  
3. **Number of round trips in 24 hours**:  
   \[
   \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6.
   \]  
   Since partial trips don’t count, the train can complete **3 full round trips** in 24 hours.  

**Final Answer:** 3 round trips. [end of text]
