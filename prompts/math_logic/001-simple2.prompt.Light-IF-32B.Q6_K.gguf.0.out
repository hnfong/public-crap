### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**  
The number **120** is significant in mathematics and other contexts for several reasons. Here are some of its interesting properties:

1. **Factorial:**  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $.  
   So, 120 is the factorial of 5.

2. **Highly Composite Number:**  
   120 has many divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.  
   It is a **highly composite number** (a number with more divisors than any smaller number).

3. **Triangular Number:**  
   120 is the 15th triangular number:  
   $ \frac{15 \times (15 + 1)}{2} = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120 $.  
   So, it can be represented as a triangle with 15 rows.

4. **Tetrahedral Number:**  
   120 is the 8th tetrahedral number:  
   $ \frac{8 \times (8 + 1) \times (8 + 2)}{6} = \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6} = 120 $.  
   It represents the number of spheres in a tetrahedron with 8 layers.

5. **Real-World Significance:**  
   - 120 is the maximum age of a person in many cultures (e.g., "120 years" is often used to mean a very long life).  
   - In some countries, 120 is the emergency number for police or medical services.  
   - In sports, 120 minutes is the standard duration of a football (soccer) match including extra time.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step 1: Use the quadratic formula**  
For a quadratic equation of the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $, the solutions are:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

**Step 2: Identify coefficients**  
In the equation $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $:  
- $ a = 1 $  
- $ b = -7 $  
- $ c = -18 $

**Step 3: Plug into the formula**  
$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

**Step 4: Simplify**  
$$
\sqrt{121} = 11
$$
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

**Step 5: Find the two solutions**  
- $ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $  
- $ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $

**Final Answer:**  
The solutions are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1: Calculate the time for one one-way trip**  
- Distance = 200 km  
- Speed = 60 km/h  
- Time = $ \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} $ hours ≈ 3.33 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for one round trip**  
- One round trip = 2 × one-way trip = $ 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} $ hours ≈ 6.67 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours**  
- Total time in a day = 24 hours  
- Number of round trips = $ \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 $

**Step 4: Interpret the result**  
Since the train cannot make a partial round trip, we take the **floor** of 3.6.

**Final Answer:**  
The train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

### **Summary of Answers:**

- **Q1:** 120 is the factorial of 5, a highly composite number, a triangular number, a tetrahedral number, and has cultural and real-world significance.
- **Q2:** The solutions to the equation are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.
- **Q3:** The train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.
