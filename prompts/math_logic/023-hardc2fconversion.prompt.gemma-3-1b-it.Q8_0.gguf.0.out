"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

You’ve got it exactly right! This is a really helpful trick for remembering the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let's break it down:

**The Explanation:**

The saying "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a clever mnemonic device. It’s based on a pattern in the decimal representation of Celsius and Fahrenheit. Here's how it works:

* **Celsius:**  The digits in Celsius are arranged in a way that's easy to remember.  Each digit represents a value that's *added* to the next digit.
* **Fahrenheit:** The digits in Fahrenheit are arranged in a way that's easy to remember.  Each digit represents a value that's *subtracted* from the next digit.

**Here's a breakdown with examples:**

Let's look at a few key points:

* **12°C:**  This is the starting point.  The digits are inverted.
* **13°C:**  The digits are reversed.  Now, the first digit is 3, and the second digit is 1.
* **14°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 4, and the second digit is 1.
* **15°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 5, and the second digit is 1.
* **16°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 6, and the second digit is 1.
* **17°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 7, and the second digit is 1.
* **18°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 8, and the second digit is 1.
* **19°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 9, and the second digit is 1.
* **20°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 2, and the second digit is 0.
* **21°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 2, and the second digit is 1.
* **22°C:**  The digits are reversed. Now, the first digit is 2, and the second digit is 2.

**Why does this work?**

The pattern is that each 12°C corresponds to a digit that's *added* to the next digit.  The reversed digits represent the *opposite* of the original digits.

**Let's look at a few more examples:**

* **25°C:**  The digits are reversed.  The first digit is 2, the second is 5.
* **30°C:**  The digits are reversed.  The first digit is 3, the second is 0.
* **31°C:**  The digits are reversed.  The first digit is 3, the second is 1.

**In short, the "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" rule is a really effective way to remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.**

Do you want me to:

*   Give you more examples?
*   Explain how this works in more detail (perhaps with a visual representation)? [end of text]
