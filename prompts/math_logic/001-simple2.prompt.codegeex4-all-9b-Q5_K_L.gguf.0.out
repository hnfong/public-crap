Q1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons. It is the factorial of 5 (5!), which means it is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 5. This property makes it a useful number in combinatorics and permutations. Additionally, 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it a useful number in many mathematical and practical applications, such as in the construction of calendars, the arrangement of items in groups, and the distribution of tasks among people.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / 2*1
x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
x = [7 ± 11] / 2

So, the solutions are x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 and x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance it can travel in one day and then divide that by the distance between the two cities. The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, and there are 24 hours in a day. So, the total distance it can travel in one day is 60 km/h * 24 h = 1440 km. The distance between the two cities is 200 km. Therefore, the number of round trips the train can make within a full day is 1440 km / 200 km = 7.2. Since the train can only make whole round trips, it can make 7 round trips within a full day.
