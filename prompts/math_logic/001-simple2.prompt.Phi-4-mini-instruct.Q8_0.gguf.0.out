Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties. Here are a few:

1. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
2. It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
3. It is the product of the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7) multiplied together: 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 120.
4. It is a triangular number, meaning it can be arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle.
5. It is a Harshad number (or Niven number) in base 10, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 รท 3 = 40).

Q2: To solve the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \).
2. Find the square root of the discriminant: \( \sqrt{121} = 11 \).
3. Apply the quadratic formula: 
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]
4. Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the total time for one round trip and then see how many such trips fit into 24 hours.

1. Calculate the time for one round trip:
   - Distance between the cities: 200 km
   - Total distance for a round trip: 200 km * 2 = 400 km
   - Average speed: 60 km/h
   - Time for one round trip: \( \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \)

2. Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:
   - Total time available: 24 hours
   - Number of round trips: \( \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{6.67 \text{ hours/trip}} \approx 3.6 \)

Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day. [end of text]
