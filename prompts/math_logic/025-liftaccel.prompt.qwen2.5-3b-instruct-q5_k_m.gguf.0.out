There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's tackle each question step by step.

### 1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?

To solve this, we need to consider both the acceleration and deceleration phases of the lift's journey.

**Step 1: Determine the total distance and time for the journey.**

- Total distance \( d = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \).

**Step 2: Determine the time for the acceleration phase.**

- The lift accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of 5 m/s.
- Using the formula \( v = u + at \), where \( v = 5 \text{ m/s} \), \( u = 0 \text{ m/s} \), and \( a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \):
  \[
  t_{\text{accel}} = \frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s} - 0 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the time for the deceleration phase.**

- The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to rest.
- Using the same formula \( v = u + at \), where \( v = 0 \text{ m/s} \), \( u = 5 \text{ m/s} \), and \( a = -1 \text{ m/s}^2 \):
  \[
  t_{\text{decel}} = \frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{0 \text{ m/s} - 5 \text{ m/s}}{-1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
  \]

**Step 4: Determine the distance covered during acceleration and deceleration.**

- Distance covered during acceleration \( d_{\text{accel}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{accel}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \).
- Distance covered during deceleration \( d_{\text{decel}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{decel}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \).

**Step 5: Determine the distance covered during constant speed.**

- Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration \( d_{\text{accel}} + d_{\text{decel}} = 12.5 \text{ meters} + 12.5 \text{ meters} = 25 \text{ meters} \).
- Distance covered during constant speed \( d_{\text{const}} = 200 \text{ meters} - 25 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters} \).

**Step 6: Determine the time for the constant speed phase.**

- Time for constant speed \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{d_{\text{const}}}{v} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds} \).

**Step 7: Calculate the total time.**

- Total time \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} + 35 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 45 \text{ seconds} \).

So, the total time for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is \(\boxed{45 \text{ seconds}}\).

### 2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Step 1: Determine the distance for each person.**

- First person: \( d_1 = 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \).
- Second person: \( d_2 = 30 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 150 \text{ meters} \).

**Step 2: Determine the time for each person.**

- First person:
  - Acceleration phase: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Constant speed phase: \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{50 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 10 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Deceleration phase: \( t_{\text{decel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Total time for first person: \( t_{\text{total,1}} = 5 \text{ seconds} + 10 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 20 \text{ seconds} \).

- Second person:
  - Acceleration phase: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Constant speed phase: \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{150 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 30 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Deceleration phase: \( t_{\text{decel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Total time for second person: \( t_{\text{total,2}} = 5 \text{ seconds} + 30 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

So, the total time for the first person is \(\boxed{20 \text{ seconds}}\) and for the second person is \(\boxed{40 \text{ seconds}}\).

### 3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Step 1: Determine the distance for the first person.**

- First person: \( d_1 = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \).

**Step 2: Determine the time for the first person.**

- Acceleration phase: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
- Constant speed phase: \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{200 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).
- Deceleration phase: \( t_{\text{decel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
- Total time for first person: \( t_{\text{total,1}} = 5 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 50 \text{ seconds} \).

**Step 3: Determine the minimum time for the second person.**

- The second person needs to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. To minimize the time, the second person should stop at the floor that minimizes the total time.

- Let's consider stopping at the 20/F floor (halfway between 1/F and 40/F).

  - Acceleration phase: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).
  - Constant speed phase: \( d_{\text{const}} = 20 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/f
