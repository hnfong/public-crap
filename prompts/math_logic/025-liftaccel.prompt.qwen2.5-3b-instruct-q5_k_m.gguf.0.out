Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

To solve this, we need to consider the lift's acceleration and deceleration phases. The lift accelerates from rest to its maximum speed of 5 m/s, and then decelerates from 5 m/s to rest at the top floor.

1. **Time to reach maximum speed (t1):**
   \[
   v = u + at \implies 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t_1 \implies t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Distance covered during acceleration (d1):**
   \[
   d_1 = ut_1 + \frac{1}{2}at_1^2 = 0 \cdot 5 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Time to decelerate (t2):**
   \[
   v = u + at \implies 5 = 5 + 1 \cdot t_2 \implies t_2 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Distance covered during deceleration (d2):**
   \[
   d_2 = ut_2 + \frac{1}{2}at_2^2 = 5 \cdot 5 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 25 + 12.5 = 37.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Total distance to the top floor (d_total):**
   \[
   d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_{\text{remaining}} + d_2 = 12.5 + 30 \times 5 + 37.5 = 12.5 + 150 + 37.5 = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]

6. **Distance covered during constant speed (d3):**
   \[
   d_3 = d_{\text{total}} - d_1 - d_2 = 200 - 12.5 - 37.5 = 150 \text{ meters}
   \]

7. **Time to cover the constant speed distance (t3):**
   \[
   t_3 = \frac{d_3}{v} = \frac{150}{5} = 30 \text{ seconds}
   \]

8. **Total time (t_total):**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 = 5 + 30 + 5 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, the total time to get from the ground floor to the top floor is **40 seconds**.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

For the first person going to 10/F:
1. **Time to reach 10/F (t1):**
   \[
   d_1 = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters}
   \]
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Time to decelerate (t2):**
   \[
   t_2 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Time to reach maximum speed (t3):**
   \[
   t_3 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Time to cover the remaining distance (t4):**
   \[
   d_4 = 30 \times 5 - 50 = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ meters}
   \]
   \[
   t_4 = \frac{d_4}{v} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Total time (t_total):**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 + t_4 = 10 + 5 + 5 + 20 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, the total time for the first person to reach 10/F and the second person to reach 30/F is **40 seconds**.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the midpoint between the ground floor and 40/F, which is the 20/F floor.

1. **Time to reach 20/F (t1):**
   \[
   d_1 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters}
   \]
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{d_1}{v} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Time to decelerate (t2):**
   \[
   t_2 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Time to reach maximum speed (t3):**
   \[
   t_3 = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Time to cover the remaining distance (t4):**
   \[
   d_4 = 40 \times 5 - 100 = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ meters}
   \]
   \[
   t_4 = \frac{d_4}{v} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Total time (t_total):**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_3 + t_2 + t_4 = 20 + 5 + 5 + 20 = 50 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, the minimum time for the lift to get to 40/F, stopping at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, is **50 seconds**. [end of text]
