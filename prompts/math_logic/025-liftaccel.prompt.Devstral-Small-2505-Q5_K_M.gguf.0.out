Let's solve these questions step by step.

**1. Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor:**

First, we need to calculate the total distance the lift needs to travel. Since each floor is 5 meters tall and there are 40 floors, the total distance is:

Distance = Number of floors * Height per floor
Distance = 40 * 5 = 200 meters

The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s. The time it takes to reach this speed is:

Time to reach max speed = Max speed / Acceleration
Time to reach max speed = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds

The distance covered during this acceleration is:

Distance during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * Time²
Distance during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * (5 s)² = 12.5 meters

The remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance during acceleration
Remaining distance = 200 m - 12.5 m = 187.5 meters

The time it takes to cover this remaining distance at maximum speed is:

Time at max speed = Remaining distance / Max speed
Time at max speed = 187.5 m / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds

Finally, the lift decelerates at 1 m/s² to come to a stop. The time it takes to decelerate is the same as the time it took to accelerate, which is 5 seconds.

So, the total time to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:

Total time = Time to reach max speed + Time at max speed + Time to decelerate
Total time = 5 s + 37.5 s + 5 s = 47.5 seconds

**2. Time for two people going to 10/F and 30/F:**

First person goes to 10/F, which is 50 meters (10 floors * 5 meters per floor). The lift will accelerate, reach max speed, and then decelerate to stop at 10/F.

The time to reach max speed is still 5 seconds, and the distance covered during acceleration is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to 10/F is 50 m - 12.5 m = 37.5 meters. The time to cover this distance at max speed is 37.5 m / 5 m/s = 7.5 seconds. The time to decelerate is 5 seconds.

So, the total time to get to 10/F is 5 s + 7.5 s + 5 s = 17.5 seconds.

The second person goes to 30/F, which is 150 meters (30 floors * 5 meters per floor). The lift will accelerate again, reach max speed, and then decelerate to stop at 30/F.

The time to reach max speed is still 5 seconds, and the distance covered during acceleration is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to 30/F is 150 m - 12.5 m = 137.5 meters. The time to cover this distance at max speed is 137.5 m / 5 m/s = 27.5 seconds. The time to decelerate is 5 seconds.

So, the total time to get to 30/F is 5 s + 27.5 s + 5 s = 37.5 seconds.

Since the lift has to stop at 10/F before continuing to 30/F, the total time for both people is the sum of the times to get to each floor:

Total time = Time to 10/F + Time to 30/F
Total time = 17.5 s + 37.5 s = 55 seconds

**3. Minimum time to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor:**

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the ground floor. In this case, it would be the first floor (1/F), which is 5 meters above the ground floor.

The lift will accelerate, reach max speed, decelerate to stop at 1/F, accelerate again, reach max speed, and finally decelerate to stop at 40/F.

The time to reach max speed is 5 seconds, and the distance covered during acceleration is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to 1/F is 5 m - 12.5 m = -7.5 meters, which means the lift will not reach max speed before stopping at 1/F. The time to decelerate is 5 seconds.

So, the total time to get to 1/F is 5 s + 5 s = 10 seconds.

The remaining distance to 40/F is 200 m - 5 m = 195 meters. The lift will accelerate again, reach max speed, and then decelerate to stop at 40/F.

The time to reach max speed is 5 seconds, and the distance covered during acceleration is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance to 40/F is 195 m - 12.5 m = 182.5 meters. The time to cover this distance at max speed is 182.5 m / 5 m/s = 36.5 seconds. The time to decelerate is 5 seconds.

So, the total time to get to 40/F is 5 s + 36.5 s + 5 s = 46.5 seconds.

The total time for the lift to get to 40/F with a stop at 1/F is the sum of the times to get to each floor:

Total time = Time to 1/F + Time to 40/F
Total time = 10 s + 46.5 s = 56.5 seconds

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 56.5 seconds. [end of text]
