Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once to make 24. Hmm, I remember that 24 can be achieved by multiplying 4 and 6, or 3 and 8, or 12 and 2, etc. Let me think about possible combinations.

First, I see that 8 and 3 are factors of 24. If I multiply them, 8 * 3 = 24, but then I still have 4 and 1 left. I need to use all numbers, so maybe I can do something like 8 * 3 * (something with 4 and 1). But 4 and 1 could be 4/1 or 4*1, but that would either multiply or divide the 24, which might not help. Wait, if I do 8 * 3 * (1 - 4/ something), but that might complicate things.

Another approach: maybe use addition and subtraction. For example, 8 * 3 = 24, and then I need to incorporate 4 and 1 without changing the value. But how? If I add and subtract the same number, like 8 * 3 + 4 - 4, but I don't have two 4s. I only have one 4 and one 1. So that won't work.

What if I use division? Like 8 / (something) to get a number that when combined with others gives 24. Let's see, 8 divided by 1/3 is 24, but I don't have a fraction yet. Wait, 8 / (1/3) = 24, but how do I get 1/3 from 4 and 3? 3 divided by 4 is 0.75, not 1/3. Hmm.

Maybe combine 4 and 3 first. 4 + 3 = 7, 4 - 3 = 1, 4 * 3 = 12, 4 / 3 â‰ˆ 1.333. Then with 8 and 1. Let's try 4 * 3 = 12, then 12 * 2 = 24, but I don't have a 2. Wait, 8 / 4 = 2, but I already used 4. No, I have to use each number once.

Wait, here's an idea: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. But maybe I can adjust that. What if I do 8 * (3 + 1) - 4? That would be 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, not 24. Or 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 * something, but I don't have another number.

Another thought: 3 * 8 = 24, and then I need to use 4 and 1 in a way that doesn't change the value. Like 3 * 8 * (4 / 4) * 1, but that uses 4 twice. No, I can't do that. Wait, 3 * 8 * (1) * (4 / 4), but again, 4 is used twice. Not allowed.

What if I use subtraction or addition with the remaining numbers. For example, 3 * 8 = 24, then 24 + 4 - 4 = 24, but again, using 4 twice. Not possible.

Maybe I need to use division. Let's think: 8 / (1/3) = 24, but how to get 1/3 from 4 and 3? 3 / 4 is 0.75, not 1/3. Wait, 1 / 3 is 0.333, but I have 1 and 3. If I do 1 / 3, that's 1/3, then 8 / (1/3) = 24. But then I still have the 4 left. So I need to incorporate the 4 somehow without changing the value. Like 8 / (1/3) * (4 / 4) = 24 * 1 = 24. But again, using 4 twice. Not allowed.

Hmm, maybe I need to use all numbers in a different way. Let's try combining 4 and 1 first. 4 + 1 = 5, 4 - 1 = 3, 4 * 1 = 4, 4 / 1 = 4. Then with 8 and 3. If I have 4 + 1 = 5, then 8 * 3 = 24, but how to combine 5 with 24? 24 - 5 = 19, not helpful. 24 / 5 = 4.8, no. 24 + 5 = 29, no.

What if I do (8 * 3) - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, not 24. Or (8 * 3) + (4 - 1) = 24 + 3 = 27, no. (8 * 3) * (4 / 4) = 24 * 1 = 24, but again, 4 used twice.

Wait, maybe I can use the numbers in a different order. Let's think about fractions. For example, 8 / ( (4 - 3) / 1 ) = 8 / (1 / 1) = 8, not helpful. Or 8 * ( (4 - 3) + 1 ) = 8 * (1 + 1) = 16, no.

Another idea: 3 * (8 - (4 / 1)) = 3 * (8 - 4) = 3 * 4 = 12, not 24. Or 3 * (8 + (4 / 1)) = 3 * 12 = 36, too big.

What if I use exponents? But the problem probably expects basic operations. Let me check the initial attempts. The user tried (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 16, then 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, then 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24, but that uses 4 twice.

Wait, in the third attempt, they used 4 * (8 - 3) + 4, which is 4 * 5 + 4 = 24, but they have only one 4. So that's invalid. So I need to use each number exactly once.

Let me try 8 * (3 - (1 / 4)) = 8 * (3 - 0.25) = 8 * 2.75 = 22, not 24. Close, but not quite.

What if I do 8 * 3 * (1 - 4/ something), but I don't have another number. Wait, 8 * 3 * (4 / 4) = 24 * 1 = 24, but again, 4 used twice.

Hmm, maybe I need to use subtraction or addition with the numbers. Let's think: 4 * 6 = 24, how to get 6 from 3, 1, 8. 8 - 3 + 1 = 6, yes! So 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Let me check: 8 - 3 is 5, plus 1 is 6, times 4 is 24. And the numbers used are 4, 8, 3, 1. Perfect! Each number used exactly once.

So the expression is 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 24. Let me verify: 8 - 3 = 5, 5 + 1 = 6, 4 * 6 = 24. Yes! That works.
</think>

Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24  
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct. [end of text]
