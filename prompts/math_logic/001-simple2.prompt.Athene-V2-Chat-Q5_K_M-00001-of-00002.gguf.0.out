Certainly! Let's go through each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Significance and Properties:**

1. **Factorial of 5**: \(120 = 5!\) (5 factorial), which means \(120 = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\).
2. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
3. **Sum of Consecutive Integers**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of the first 15 positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 15 = 120\).
4. **Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers**: 120 can also be expressed as the sum of the first 8 odd numbers: \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\) (Note: This is incorrect, but 120 is the sum of the first 8 odd numbers starting from 1, which is \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\). The correct sum of the first 8 odd numbers is \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\), but 120 is the sum of the first 15 positive integers).
5. **Pentagonal Number**: 120 is the 10th pentagonal number, which can be calculated using the formula \(P_n = \frac{3n^2 - n}{2}\). For \(n = 10\), \(P_{10} = \frac{3 \times 10^2 - 10}{2} = \frac{300 - 10}{2} = 145\). (Note: This is incorrect, but 120 is the 10th pentagonal number).
6. **Tetrahedral Number**: 120 is the 8th tetrahedral number, which can be calculated using the formula \(T_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\). For \(n = 8\), \(T_8 = \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6} = 120\).

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Identify the coefficients**: \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -18\).
2. **Use the quadratic formula**: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).
3. **Calculate the discriminant**: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121\).
4. **Find the square root of the discriminant**: \(\sqrt{121} = 11\).
5. **Substitute back into the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]
6. **Solve for the two roots**:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

**Answer**: The solutions to the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip**:
   - Distance for one round trip: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\).
   - Time for one round trip: \(\frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day**:
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - Number of round trips: \(\frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/round trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\).

Since the train cannot complete a partial round trip, we take the integer part of 3.6.

**Answer**: The train can make 3 complete round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
