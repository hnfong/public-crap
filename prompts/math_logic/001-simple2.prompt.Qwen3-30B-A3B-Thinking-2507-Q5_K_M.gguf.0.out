Okay, let me tackle these three questions one by one. Starting with Q1 about the number 120. Hmm, I remember 120 is a factorial number—5! equals 120, right? Let me confirm: 5×4×3×2×1 is 120. Yeah, that's correct. Also, it's a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me list its divisors to check: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. Yep, that's 16 divisors, which is a lot for a number that size. 

Another thing—120 is a triangular number? Wait, triangular numbers are n(n+1)/2. Let's see: 15×16/2 is 120. Oh, right! So 15th triangular number is 120. Also, it's a tetrahedral number? Tetrahedral numbers are n(n+1)(n+2)/6. For n=8: 8×9×10/6 = 720/6 = 120. Yep, so 8th tetrahedral number. 

Oh, and in geometry, a regular icosahedron has 120 symmetries? Wait, no, I think it's 120 for the full symmetry group. Let me recall: the icosahedral group has 60 rotational symmetries, but including reflections it's 120. Yeah, that's right. Also, 120 is the smallest number that is a multiple of 1 through 10 except 7? Wait, no, 120 is divisible by 1-10 except... 120 divided by 7 is about 17.14, so not integer. But it's divisible by 1-6, 8, 9, 10. Wait, 120/9 is 13.333, so not divisible by 9 either. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up. Actually, the least common multiple of 1-10 is 2520, so 120 isn't that. But 120 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10. 

Also, in sports, a cricket match has 120 overs in a limited-overs game? Wait, no, that's 50 overs. Maybe not. Oh, but in some contexts, like the 120th anniversary or something. But the mathematical properties are more interesting. Let me stick to the math ones. 

So summarizing: factorial (5!), highly composite, triangular (15th), tetrahedral (8th), symmetry group of icosahedron (120 elements), and it's a pronic number? Pronic numbers are n(n+1), so 10×11=110, 11×12=132, so no, 120 isn't pronic. Wait, 120 is also a factorial, which is a type of pronic? No, factorial is different. 

Another property: 120 is the sum of the first 10 even numbers? Let's see: 2+4+6+...+20 = 2(1+2+...+10) = 2×55=110. Not 120. Sum of first 15 odd numbers is 15²=225, no. Wait, sum of first 10 natural numbers is 55, so not that. 

Wait, 120 is a refactorable number? Refactorable numbers are divisible by the count of their divisors. It has 16 divisors, and 120/16=7.5, so no. Not refactorable. 

Okay, I think I have enough for Q1. Let's move to Q2: solve x² -7x -18=0. Quadratic equation. I can factor it or use quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Wait, the equation is x² -7x -18, so factors of -18 that add to -7. Let's see: 9 and -2: 9×(-2)=-18, 9+(-2)=7. But we need -7, so maybe -9 and +2: (-9)+2=-7, and (-9)(2)=-18. Yes! So factors are (x - 9)(x + 2)=0. Let me check: (x-9)(x+2)=x² +2x -9x -18=x²-7x-18. Perfect. So solutions are x=9 and x=-2. 

Alternatively, quadratic formula: x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± √121]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2. So (7+11)/2=18/2=9, (7-11)/2=-4/2=-2. Same answers. 

Q3: Train speed 60 km/h, distance 200 km between cities. Round trip is 400 km (200 there, 200 back). Time for one round trip: distance/speed = 400/60 hours. Simplify: 400÷60=20/3≈6.666 hours per round trip. Now, how many in a full day? A day has 24 hours. So number of trips = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6. But you can't do a fraction of a trip, so it's 3 full round trips. Wait, but let's check the math again. 

Time per round trip: 200 km × 2 = 400 km. Time = 400 / 60 = 20/3 hours ≈6.6667 hours. Total time in day: 24 hours. Number of trips: 24 ÷ (20/3) = 24 × 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6. So yes, 3 full trips, since 3 trips take 3×20/3=20 hours, and 4 trips would take 80/3≈26.666 hours, which is more than 24. So answer is 3. 

Wait, but the question says "within a full day," so if it starts at time 0, first trip ends at 20/3≈6.666, second at 13.333, third at 20 hours, fourth would start at 20 and end at 26.666, which is after 24. So yes, 3 round trips. 

Let me confirm the calculation: 20/3 hours per trip. 3 trips: 20 hours. 24-20=4 hours left, not enough for another trip (needs 6.666). So 3 is correct. 

Now, for Q1, I should list the key properties clearly. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. 120 is also a factorial (5!), a pronic number? Wait, pronic is n(n+1), 120=10×12, no, 10×11=110, 11×12=132. So not pronic. But it is a factorial, which is a different sequence. 

Another thing: 120 is the number of minutes in 2 hours, but that's trivial. Not sure if that's interesting. 

Also, in the context of the 120th anniversary of something, but mathematically, the key points are factorial, highly composite, triangular, tetrahedral, and icosahedral symmetry. 

Wait, triangular number: n(n+1)/2=120 → n²+n-240=0. Discriminant 1+960=961=31². So n=(-1±31)/2, positive solution 30/2=15. Yes, 15th triangular number. 

Tetrahedral: n(n+1)(n+2)/6=120 → n(n+1)(n+2)=720. Let's see, 8×9×10=720. Yes, so n=8. 

Symmetry group: the full icosahedral group (including reflections) has order 120. The rotation group is 60. 

Also, 120 is a Harshad number (divisible by sum of its digits: 1+2+0=3, 120/3=40, yes). 

So I'll include those in the answer. 

Now, for the answers, I need to provide steps. Let's structure each answer with steps.

### Q1: Significance and Interesting Properties of the Number 120

**Answer:**  
The number **120** has several fascinating mathematical properties. Here are its key features:

---

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Factorial Number**:  
   - $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $.  
   - This makes 120 the **5th factorial number**.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   - A highly composite number has more divisors than any smaller number.  
   - **Divisors of 120**: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 $ (total **16 divisors**).  
   - No smaller number has as many divisors.

3. **Triangular Number**:  
   - A triangular number is of the form $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $.  
   - Solve $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 120 $:  
     $ n^2 + n - 240 = 0 $ → $ n = 15 $ (positive solution).  
   - Thus, **120 is the 15th triangular number**.

4. **Tetrahedral Number**:  
   - A tetrahedral number is of the form $ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} $.  
   - Solve $ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} = 120 $:  
     $ n(n+1)(n+2) = 720 $ → $ n = 8 $ (since $ 8 \times 9 \times 10 = 720 $).  
   - Thus, **120 is the 8th tetrahedral number**.

5. **Symmetry Group of the Icosahedron**:  
   - The **full symmetry group** (including reflections) of a regular icosahedron has **120 elements**.  
   - The rotation-only symmetry group has 60 elements.

6. **Harshad Number**:  
   - A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits.  
   - Sum of digits: $ 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 $, and $ 120 \div 3 = 40 $ (integer).  
   - Thus, **120 is a Harshad number**.

### Q2: Solve the Equation $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $

**Answer:**  
The solutions are $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Factor the quadratic equation**:  
   - Find two numbers that multiply to $-18$ and add to $-7$.  
     These numbers are $-9$ and $+2$ (since $-9 \times 2 = -18$ and $-9 + 2 = -7$).  
   - Rewrite the equation:  
     $$
     x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
     $$

2. **Solve for $ x $**:  
   - $ x - 9 = 0 $ → $ x = 9 $  
   - $ x + 2 = 0 $ → $ x = -2 $

3. **Verification using the quadratic formula**:  
   - Formula: $ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $, where $ a = 1, b = -7, c = -18 $.  
   - Discriminant: $ (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 $.  
   - $ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} $.  
     - $ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 $  
     - $ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2 $

### Q3: Round Trips by Train in a Full Day

**Answer:**  
The train can make **3 full round trips** within a full day.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Calculate distance for one round trip**:  
   - One-way distance = 200 km.  
   - Round trip distance = $ 200 \times 2 = 400 $ km.

2. **Time for one round trip**:  
   - Speed = 60 km/h.  
   - Time = $ \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667 $ hours.

3. **Total time available in a day**:  
   - 1 full day = 24 hours.

4. **Number of round trips**:  
   - $ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 $.  
   - Since partial trips are not allowed, **only 3 full round trips** fit within 24 hours.

5. **Verification**:  
   - Time for 3 round trips = $ 3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20 $ hours.  
   - Remaining time = $ 24 - 20 = 4 $ hours (insufficient for a 4th trip, which requires $ \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 $ hours).

---

### Final Answers:
- **Q1**: 120 is a factorial (5!), highly composite, triangular (15th), tetrahedral (8th), and has 120 symmetries in the icosahedron.  
- **Q2**: $ x = 9 $ and $ x = -2 $.  
- **Q3**: **3 round trips**. [end of text]
