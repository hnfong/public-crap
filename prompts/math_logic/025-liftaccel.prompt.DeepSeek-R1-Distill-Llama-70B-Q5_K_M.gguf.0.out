Okay, so I have these three elevator problems to solve. Let me take them one by one. I need to figure out the time it takes for the elevator to go from the ground floor to the top floor, then handle some scenarios with multiple people getting off on different floors. Hmm, let's start with the first question.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

Alright, the building has 40 floors, each 5 meters tall. So the total height from ground to top is 40 floors * 5 meters = 200 meters. The elevator has an acceleration and deceleration of 1 m/s², and a maximum speed of 5 m/s.

I remember that when an elevator accelerates, it goes through three phases: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration. So first, it speeds up until it reaches its maximum speed, then cruises at that speed, and then slows down to stop at the desired floor.

To find the time, I need to calculate how long each phase takes and the distance covered in each phase.

First, let's find out how long it takes to reach the maximum speed. Acceleration is 1 m/s², so time to reach 5 m/s is t = (5 m/s) / (1 m/s²) = 5 seconds. During this time, the distance covered is (1/2)*a*t² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, when decelerating, it will take another 5 seconds to come to a stop, covering another 12.5 meters.

So the total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. That leaves the remaining distance to be covered at constant speed: 200 - 25 = 175 meters.

Now, time at constant speed is distance divided by speed: 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

So total time is acceleration time + constant speed time + deceleration time: 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

Wait, let me double-check. Acceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Deceleration phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters. Cruise: 175 meters at 5 m/s is 35 seconds. So yes, 5+35+5=45 seconds. That seems right.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Hmm, so the elevator needs to stop at 10th floor and then 30th floor. But since both are going up, the elevator will first go to 10/F, let the first person out, then continue to 30/F. So the total time is the time to go from 1/F to 10/F, plus the time from 10/F to 30/F.

But wait, does the elevator have to decelerate and accelerate again between floors? Or does it just adjust its speed? Hmm, I think when it stops at 10/F, it has to decelerate, stop, then accelerate again to go to 30/F. So we need to calculate the time for each segment.

First, from 1/F to 10/F: 10 floors, each 5 meters, so 50 meters.

Similarly, from 10/F to 30/F: 20 floors, 100 meters.

So let's calculate the time for each segment.

First segment: 1/F to 10/F, 50 meters.

We can use the same method as before. The elevator accelerates until it reaches max speed, then maybe cruises, then decelerates.

But wait, does it reach max speed in this 50 meters? Let's check.

Time to reach max speed is 5 seconds, as before, covering 12.5 meters. So in 50 meters, after 5 seconds, it's going 5 m/s, and has 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters left.

But wait, if it continues at 5 m/s, the time would be 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds. But then it needs to decelerate. So the total time would be 5 (acceleration) + 7.5 (cruise) + 5 (deceleration) = 17.5 seconds. But wait, that would be for 50 meters? Let me check.

Wait, no. Because if it accelerates for 5 seconds, covers 12.5 meters, then cruises for 7.5 seconds, covering 37.5 meters, that's 50 meters total. Then it needs to decelerate. But deceleration takes 5 seconds, but does it have enough distance to decelerate? Wait, 12.5 meters is needed for deceleration. But in this case, after cruising 37.5 meters, the total distance is 50 meters. So if it starts decelerating after 50 meters, it would have already reached the destination. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the elevator doesn't reach max speed if the distance is too short. So let's see: for a 50-meter trip, does the elevator reach max speed?

The distance needed to reach max speed and then decelerate is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters. So for 50 meters, it can accelerate, reach max speed, cruise, and then decelerate. So the phases would be:

1. Accelerate for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters.

2. Cruise at 5 m/s for (50 - 25) = 25 meters, which takes 25 / 5 = 5 seconds.

3. Decelerate for 5 seconds, covering 12.5 meters.

So total time: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 seconds.

Wait, that seems better. So 15 seconds to go from 1/F to 10/F.

Then, from 10/F to 30/F: 100 meters.

Again, let's see if it can reach max speed.

Time to accelerate: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Then, distance left: 100 - 25 = 75 meters.

Cruise time: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds.

Then decelerate: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

Total time: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds.

So total time for the whole trip: 15 + 25 = 40 seconds.

But wait, is that correct? Because when the elevator stops at 10/F, it has to start from rest again. So the movement from 10/F to 30/F is a separate trip, starting from 0 speed.

So yes, it needs to accelerate again, which takes 5 seconds, then cruise, then decelerate.

So total time is 15 + 25 = 40 seconds.

But wait, is there a more optimal way? Like, if the elevator doesn't have to come to a complete stop at 10/F, but just slows down enough to let the passenger out. But I think in reality, it has to stop. So we have to include the deceleration and acceleration times.

Alternatively, maybe the elevator can adjust its speed so that it doesn't have to accelerate and decelerate fully between floors. But I think for simplicity, we can assume that each segment is treated as a separate trip with full acceleration and deceleration.

So 15 seconds to 10/F, then 25 seconds to 30/F, total 40 seconds.

Wait, but let me think again. When going from 10/F to 30/F, the distance is 100 meters. So:

- Accelerate for 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.

- Then, remaining distance is 87.5 meters. At 5 m/s, that's 17.5 seconds.

But wait, 12.5 + (5*17.5) = 12.5 + 87.5 = 100 meters. So total time is 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds.

Wait, that's different. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. Because if you have 100 meters, and you accelerate for 5 seconds (12.5 meters), then you have 87.5 meters left. If you continue at 5 m/s, that would
