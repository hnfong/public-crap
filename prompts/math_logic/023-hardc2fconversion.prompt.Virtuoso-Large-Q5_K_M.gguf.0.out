Certainly! The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember certain temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit. However, it's important to note that this is not a general rule for all temperatures, but rather a specific pattern that occurs at certain intervals.

### Explanation:
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion Formula**: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
- **Pattern**: Every 12°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

### Examples:
1. **0°C to 32°F**:
   - 0°C is 32°F.
   - The digits are not inverted here, but it's a starting point.

2. **12°C to 53.6°F**:
   - 12°C is approximately 53.6°F.
   - The digits are not exactly inverted, but this is close to the pattern.

3. **-40°C to -40°F**:
   - -40°C is exactly -40°F.
   - This is a special case where the digits are the same.

4. **16°C to 60.8°F**:
   - 16°C is approximately 60.8°F.
   - The digits are not inverted, but this is another close example.

5. **28°C to 82.4°F**:
   - 28°C is approximately 82.4°F.
   - The digits are inverted (28 and 82).

6. **40°C to 104°F**:
   - 40°C is 104°F.
   - The digits are not inverted, but this is a notable conversion.

### Corrected Pattern:
A more accurate and useful pattern to remember is:
- **16°C to 61°F** (approximately 60.8°F)
- **28°C to 82°F** (approximately 82.4°F)

These are the most straightforward examples where the digits are inverted. However, it's important to note that this pattern does not hold for all temperatures, and it's best to use the conversion formula for precise conversions.

### Summary:
- **16°C ≈ 61°F**
- **28°C ≈ 82°F**

These are the key examples where the digits are inverted, making it easier to remember the conversion. For other temperatures, it's best to use the formula \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \). [end of text]
