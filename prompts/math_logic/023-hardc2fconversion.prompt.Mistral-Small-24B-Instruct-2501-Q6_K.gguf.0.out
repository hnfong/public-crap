"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
  The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. However, it's important to clarify that this is a simplified rule and not an exact conversion method. Let's break it down with examples.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Conversion Formula**:
   - The exact formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
     \[
     F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
     \]
   - Conversely, to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
     \[
     C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)
     \]

2. **Mnemonic Rule**:
   - The mnemonic suggests that for every 12°C, the digits are inverted to approximate the Fahrenheit temperature.
   - This means if you have a Celsius temperature, you can roughly estimate the Fahrenheit temperature by inverting the digits.

### Examples:

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit**:
   - **0°C**:
     - Exact conversion: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 0 + 32 = 32°F \)
     - Mnemonic: 0°C is close to 32°F (inverted digits: 032, which is 32).
   - **12°C**:
     - Exact conversion: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 53.6°F \)
     - Mnemonic: 12°C is close to 21°F (inverted digits: 21, which is not accurate but close).
   - **24°C**:
     - Exact conversion: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 75.2°F \)
     - Mnemonic: 24°C is close to 42°F (inverted digits: 42, which is not accurate but close).

2. **Fahrenheit to Celsius**:
   - **32°F**:
     - Exact conversion: \( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (32 - 32) = 0°C \)
     - Mnemonic: 32°F is close to 0°C (inverted digits: 23, which is not accurate but close).
   - **50°F**:
     - Exact conversion: \( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (50 - 32) = 10°C \)
     - Mnemonic: 50°F is close to 05°C (inverted digits: 50, which is not accurate but close).
   - **75°F**:
     - Exact conversion: \( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (75 - 32) = 23.89°C \)
     - Mnemonic: 75°F is close to 57°C (inverted digits: 57, which is not accurate but close).

### Conclusion:
The mnemonic "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a rough approximation and not a precise method for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It can be useful for quick estimates but should not be relied upon for exact conversions. For precise conversions, always use the exact formulas provided. [end of text]
