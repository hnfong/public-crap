Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance.
- **Factorization**: 120 can be factored into 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5, which means it has 8 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
- **Abundant Number**: 120 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself. The sum of its divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 315, which is greater than 120.
- **Multiples**: It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of a series of consecutive natural numbers in five different ways: 120 = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 8 + 9 + 10 + ... + 15 = 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 12 + 13 + 14.
- **Religious and Cultural Significance**: In some religious texts, 120 is significant. For example, in the Bible, the period of 120 years is mentioned in Genesis 6:3 as the time before the flood.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

1. Calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121.
2. Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can find the square root: sqrt(121) = 11.
3. Substitute into the quadratic formula: x = [7 ± 11] / 2.
4. This gives us two solutions: x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 and x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2.

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we first calculate the time for one round trip.

1. **One Way Trip Time**: The distance between the cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. Time for one way = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours or approximately 3.33 hours.
2. **Round Trip Time**: Since a round trip involves going to the other city and coming back, the total time for a round trip is 2 * (10/3) hours = 20/3 hours or approximately 6.67 hours.
3. **Total Available Time in a Day**: A full day has 24 hours.
4. **Number of Round Trips**: To find out how many round trips can be made, divide the total available time by the time for one round trip: 24 hours / (20/3 hours) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a 24-hour period.

I am not sure, but I think the answer is that the train can make 3 full round trips in a day. [end of text]
