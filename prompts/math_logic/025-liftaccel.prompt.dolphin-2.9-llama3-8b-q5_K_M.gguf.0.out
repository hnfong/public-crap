Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's solve these questions step by step.

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

To find the time it takes to travel from the ground floor to the top floor, we can use the formula:

time = (final position - initial position) / acceleration

In this case, the final position is 40 stories (40/F), and the initial position is 1 story (1/F). The acceleration is given as 1 m/s².

time = (40/F - 1/F) / 1 m/s²
time = (39/F) / 1 m/s²
time = 39/F seconds

So, it takes 39/F seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/ F and the second person goes to 30/ F. How long does it take?

In this case, we need to find the time it takes for the lift to reach both destinations (10/F and 30/F). We can use the same formula as before, but this time we need to find the total distance traveled by both people and divide it by the acceleration.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances each person travels:

Total distance = (10/F) + (30/F)
Total distance = 40/F

Now, we can find the time it takes to travel this distance:

time = (Total distance) / acceleration
time = (40/F) / 1 m/s²
time = 40/F seconds

So, it takes 40/F seconds for both people to reach their respective floors.

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/ F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/ F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/ F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/ F and 40/ F?

To find the minimum time, we need to consider the maximum distance the lift would have to travel if it stops at every floor between 1/F and 40/F. This would be the case if the lift stops at every floor, making it travel the entire height of the building.

The maximum distance the lift would travel is the height of the building, which is 40 stories (40/F).

Using the formula for time:

time = (Total distance) / acceleration
time = (40/F) / 1 m/s²
time = 40/F seconds

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 40/F seconds. [end of text]
