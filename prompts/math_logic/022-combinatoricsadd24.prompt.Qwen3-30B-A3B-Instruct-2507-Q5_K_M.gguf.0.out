```
Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) * (1 + 2) — Invalid, 2 not in original numbers. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, not 24. Retrying

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 3) — 3 used twice, invalid. Retrying

Attempt: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 — 2 not in numbers. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 — all present and used once.

Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Correct!

Final Answer: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24
