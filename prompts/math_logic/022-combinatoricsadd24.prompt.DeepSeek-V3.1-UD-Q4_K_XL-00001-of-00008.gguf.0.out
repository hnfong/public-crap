Let's try to construct an expression using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 to get 24.

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 * 1) = 4 * 3 = 12, which is not 24. Retrying

Attempt: 8 * 3 * (4 - 3) = 24 * 1 = 24, but this uses 3 twice and doesn't use 1. Retrying

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8,4,3,1) exactly once. Perfect.

So the expression is (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. [end of text]
