"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

I think I have a good understanding of what this statement means, but I'll provide an explanation and examples to ensure I'm correct.

The statement suggests that when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, for every 12-degree increment in Celsius, the digits of the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature are "inverted" or "reversed."

Let's break it down with examples:

* 0°C = 32°F (base temperature)
* 12°C = 54°F ( invert the digits: 54 → 45, but that's not correct... wait a minute!)
* Ah, I think I see what's going on here. It seems that the statement is not entirely accurate. The digits are not exactly "inverted" or "reversed." Instead, the digits seem to be "swapped" or "interchanged."

Here are some correct examples:

* 12°C = 54°F (swap the digits: 12 → 54, and 54 → 12)
* 24°C = 75°F (swap the digits: 24 → 75, and 75 → 24)
* 36°C = 97°F (swap the digits: 36 → 97, and 97 → 36)

This pattern appears to hold for every 12-degree increment in Celsius. However, please note that this is not an exact mathematical conversion method, and the results might not be precise for all temperatures. The actual conversion formula is: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.

I hope this explanation and the examples help clarify the statement. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!
