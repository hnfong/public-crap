Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Can you explain how the C++ programming language works to implement the binary search algorithm and search for the given element in an array? Answer according to: Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search is a sorting algorithm which finds the location of an element in a sorted array or a non-sorted array. It is a search algorithm because it finds the element in an array. It is called binary search algorithm because it divides the array into two halves and searches for the element in each of them. Binary search is a special case of the search algorithm, where the array is sorted in ascending order. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Choose a starting index, let's say 'i' = 1.

2. Loop from I to N-1 (N is the number of elements in the array).

3. If the current element (i) is equal to the search element (x), then the element is found.

4. If the current element (i) is greater than the search element (x), then the search element is not found, and the current element is the middle element of the two halves.

5. If the current element (i) is less than the search element (x), then the search element is found, and the middle element (i/2) is the index of the search element.

Here's the C++ code to implement the binary search algorithm:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int lo = 0, hi = n-1;

    while(lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] > x)
            hi = mid - 1;
        else
            lo = mid + 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {4, 3, 1, 8};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int x = 7;

    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, x);

    if(result != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index: " << result << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found in array" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we choose the first and last indices of the array as the starting and ending indices of the search. Then, we iterate through the array and compare each element with the search element. If the current element is equal to the search element, we find the index of the middle element using the mid-index formula. Finally, we return the index of the middle element or -1 if the element is not found. The search algorithm can be generalized to search a sorted or unsorted array. If the array is already sorted, we can choose a middle index, iterate through the array, and compare each element with the middle element. If the current element is less than or equal to the middle element, we find the index of the middle element using the mid-index formula. If the current element is greater than the middle element, we continue to the next element. If the current element is equal to the middle element, we find the index of the middle element using the mid-index formula. If the search element is not found, we return -1.
