Let's tackle each question one by one. We'll consider the motion of the lift in different phases: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.

### Given:
- Number of floors: 40
- Height per floor: 5 meters
- Total height: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters
- Acceleration/deceleration (\( a \)): \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- Maximum speed (\( v_{\text{max}} \)): \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

### 1. Time to go from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F):

#### Phases of motion:
1. **Acceleration phase**: The lift accelerates from rest to \( v_{\text{max}} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration (\( d_1 \)):
     \[
     v_{\text{max}}^2 = 2 a d_1 \implies d_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{2a} = \frac{5^2}{2 \times 1} = 12.5 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Time taken to reach \( v_{\text{max}} \) (\( t_1 \)):
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = a t_1 \implies t_1 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
     \]

2. **Constant speed phase**: The lift moves at \( v_{\text{max}} \).
   - Remaining distance after acceleration: \( 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Distance covered at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
     - The lift must decelerate over the same distance as it accelerated (\( d_1 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \)), so the distance at constant speed is:
     \[
     d_2 = 200 - 2 \times 12.5 = 175 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Time taken at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_{\text{max}}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s}
     \]

3. **Deceleration phase**: The lift decelerates from \( v_{\text{max}} \) to rest.
   - Time taken to decelerate (\( t_3 \)) is the same as \( t_1 \): \( 5 \, \text{s} \).

#### Total time:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{s}
\]

**Answer to Q1:** It takes **45 seconds** to go from the ground floor to the top floor.

### 2. Two people: one to 10/F, one to 30/F.

#### Heights:
- 10/F: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{m} \)
- 30/F: \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m} \)

#### Strategy:
The lift will go to 30/F first (since it's higher), then return to 10/F. We'll calculate the time for each segment.

#### Segment 1: 1/F to 30/F (150 m)
- **Acceleration phase**: Same as before (\( d_1 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \), \( t_1 = 5 \, \text{s} \))
- **Constant speed phase**:
  - Remaining distance after acceleration: \( 150 - 12.5 = 137.5 \, \text{m} \)
  - Distance at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
    - The lift must decelerate over \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \), so:
    \[
    d_2 = 150 - 2 \times 12.5 = 125 \, \text{m}
    \]
  - Time at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
    \[
    t_2 = \frac{125}{5} = 25 \, \text{s}
    \]
- **Deceleration phase**: \( t_3 = 5 \, \text{s} \)
- **Total time for 1/F to 30/F**:
  \[
  t_{\text{up}} = 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \, \text{s}
  \]

#### Segment 2: 30/F to 10/F (100 m downward)
- The lift must decelerate to stop at 10/F, then accelerate back up (but since it's going down, we can treat it similarly to going up but in reverse).
- However, since the lift is already moving downward at \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) when it reaches 30/F, we can consider the motion as:
  1. Decelerate from \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \) to rest at 10/F.
     - Distance to decelerate (\( d_{\text{dec}} \)):
       \[
       v_{\text{max}}^2 = 2 a d_{\text{dec}} \implies d_{\text{dec}} = \frac{5^2}{2 \times 1} = 12.5 \, \text{m}
       \]
     - Time to decelerate (\( t_{\text{dec}} \)):
       \[
       t_{\text{dec}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = 5 \, \text{s}
       \]
     - But the lift only needs to cover \( 150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{m} \) downward. Since \( d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} \), the lift cannot decelerate fully over 100 m (as it would need to decelerate over 12.5 m and then accelerate back up, which is not possible in this case). Instead, the lift will decelerate over the entire 100 m, but this would require a different approach.

   - **Correction**: The lift cannot decelerate fully over 100 m because it would require more distance than available. Instead, the lift will decelerate until it stops at 10/F, meaning it must decelerate over the entire 100 m, but this would imply a different acceleration (which is not allowed). This suggests that the lift cannot stop at 10/F after going to 30/F without violating the acceleration constraints.

   - **Alternative approach**: The lift must go to 10/F first, then to 30/F. This is more efficient.

#### Revised Strategy: Go to 10/F first, then to 30/F.

#### Segment 1: 1/F to 10/F (50 m)
- **Acceleration phase**: \( d_1 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \), \( t_1 = 5 \, \text{s} \)
- **Constant speed phase**:
  - Remaining distance: \( 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \, \text{m} \)
  - Distance at constant speed (\( d_2 \)):
    - The lift must decelerate over \( 12.5 \, \text{m} \), so:
    \[
    d_2 = 50 - 2 \times 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m}
    \]
  - Time at constant speed (\( t_2 \)):
    \[
    t_2 = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{s}
    \]
- **Deceleration phase**: \( t_3 = 5 \, \text{s} \)
- **Total time for 1/F to 10/F**:
  \[
  t_{\text{up1}} = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s}
  \]

#### Segment 2: 10/F to 30/F (10
