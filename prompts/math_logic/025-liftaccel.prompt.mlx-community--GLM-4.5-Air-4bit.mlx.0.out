==========
Let's tackle each question one by one.

### **Given:**
- **Building:** 40 stories, each floor is 5 meters tall.
- **Total height:** \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters.
- **Elevator parameters:**
  - Acceleration/deceleration: \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
  - Maximum speed: \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \).

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Motion Phases:**
   - **Acceleration phase:** From rest, accelerate at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) until reaching \( v_{\text{max}} \) or until it's time to decelerate.
   - **Constant speed phase:** If the distance is long enough, the elevator will reach \( v_{\text{max}} \) and travel at that speed for some time.
   - **Deceleration phase:** Decelerate at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) to come to a stop at the destination.

2. **Time to reach max speed:**
   - \( t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 25 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \).
   - Similarly, distance covered during deceleration: \( d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Total distance for acceleration + deceleration:**
   - \( d_{\text{acc}} + d_{\text{dec}} = 25 \, \text{m} \).

4. **Distance at constant speed:**
   - If the total distance \( D > 25 \, \text{m} \), then the elevator will have a constant speed phase.
   - Distance at constant speed: \( D_{\text{const}} = D - 25 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time at constant speed: \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{D_{\text{const}}}{v_{\text{max}}} \).

5. **Total time for a trip:**
   - \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{dec}} = 5 + t_{\text{const}} + 5 = 10 + t_{\text{const}} \).

---

### **Question 1: Time to go from 1/F to 40/F (200 meters)**
- Total distance \( D = 200 \, \text{m} \).
- \( D > 25 \, \text{m} \), so there is a constant speed phase.
- \( D_{\text{const}} = 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{m} \).
- \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{s} \).
- Total time: \( t_{\text{total}} = 10 + 35 = 45 \, \text{s} \).

**Answer 1:** 45 seconds.

---

### **Question 2: Two people, 10/F and 30/F**
- **First person (10/F):** Height = \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- **Second person (30/F):** Height = \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \, \text{m} \).

The elevator must stop at both floors. We need to calculate the time for the entire trip, including stops.

#### **Trip to 10/F (50 m):**
- \( D = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- \( D > 25 \, \text{m} \), so constant speed phase.
- \( D_{\text{const}} = 50 - 25 = 25 \, \text{m} \).
- \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{s} \).
- Time to 10/F: \( t_{\text{total}} = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s} \).
- **Stop time at 10/F:** Assume 10 seconds (typical elevator stop time).

#### **Trip from 10/F to 30/F (100 m):**
- Distance from 10/F to 30/F: \( (30 - 10) \times 5 = 100 \, \text{m} \).
- \( D = 100 \, \text{m} \).
- \( D > 25 \, \text{m} \), so constant speed phase.
- \( D_{\text{const}} = 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m} \).
- \( t_{\text{const}} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \, \text{s} \).
- Time from 10/F to 30/F: \( t_{\text{total}} = 10 + 15 = 25 \, \text{s} \).
- **Stop time at 30/F:** 10 seconds.

#### **Total time:**
- Time to 10/F: 15 s (motion) + 10 s (stop) = 25 s.
- Time from 10/F to 30/F: 25 s (motion) + 10 s (stop) = 35 s.
- **Total time:** 25 + 35 = 60 s.

**Answer 2:** 60 seconds.

### **Question 3: Two people, one to 40/F, the other to some floor in between (not 40/F)**
We need to minimize the time to reach 40/F, given that the elevator must stop at one other floor between 1/F and 40/F.

#### **Optimal Strategy:**
- The elevator should stop at the floor that minimizes the total time to reach 40/F.
- The optimal stop is likely to be as close as possible to 40/F to minimize the deceleration distance, but we need to verify.

#### **General Approach:**
1. Let the intermediate stop be at floor \( k \) (where \( 1 < k < 40 \)).
2. The elevator goes from 1/F to \( k \), then from \( k \) to 40/F.
3. We need to find \( k \) that minimizes the total time.

#### **Calculations:**
- **Height to \( k \):** \( h_k = 5k \, \text{m} \).
- **Height from \( k \) to 40/F:** \( h_{40} - h_k = 5(40 - k) \, \text{m} \).

#### **Time to \( k \):**
- If \( h_k \leq 25 \, \text{m} \), no constant speed phase.
  - \( t_{\text{to } k} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{h_k}{a}} = 2 \sqrt{5k} \).
- If \( h_k > 25 \, \text{m} \), constant speed phase.
  - \( t_{\text{to } k} = 10 + \frac{5k - 25}{5} = 5k \).

#### **Time from \( k \) to 40/F:**
- If \( h_{40} - h_k \leq 25 \, \text{m} \), no constant speed phase.
  - \( t_{\text{from } k} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{5(40 - k)}{1}} = 2 \sqrt{5(40 - k)} \).
- If \( h_{40} - h_k > 25 \, \text{m} \), constant speed phase.
  - \( t_{\text{from } k} = 10 + \frac{5(40 - k) - 25}{5} = 25 - k \).

#### **Total Time:**
- We need to consider the stop time at \( k \) (assume 10 s).
- Total time \( T = t_{\text{to } k} + 10 + t_{\text{from } k} \).

#### **Finding Optimal \( k \):**
We need to find \( k \) that minimizes \( T \). Let's consider two cases:

1. **Case 1:** \( h_k \leq 25 \, \text{m} \) (i.e., \( k \leq 5 \)).
   - \( t_{\text{to } k} = 2 \sqrt{5k} \).
   - \( h_{40} - h_k = 200 - 5k \geq 175 \, \text{m} \) (since \( k \leq 5 \)), so constant speed phase.
   - \( t_{\text{from } k} = 25 - k \).
   - \( T = 2 \sqrt{5
