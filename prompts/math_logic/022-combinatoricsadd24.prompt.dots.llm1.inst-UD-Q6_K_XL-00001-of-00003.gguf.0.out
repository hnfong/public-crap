Let's try to find a valid expression using the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) exactly once to get 24.

### Attempt 1:
(8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

### Attempt 2:
8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying

### Attempt 3:
4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying

### Attempt 4:
(4 + 1) * 3 + 8 = 5 * 3 + 8 = 15 + 8 = 23, which is not 24. Retrying

### Attempt 5:
8 * (3 - (4 - 1)) = 8 * (3 - 3) = 8 * 0 = 0, which is not 24. Retrying

### Attempt 6:
(8 - (1 + 3)) * 4 = (8 - 4) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying

### Attempt 7:
(4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.

### Final Answer:
(4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1). Correct! [end of text]
