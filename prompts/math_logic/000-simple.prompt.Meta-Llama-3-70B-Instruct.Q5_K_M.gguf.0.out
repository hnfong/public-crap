Here are the answers to the questions:

Q1: 1+1= 2

Q2: 6*7= 42

Q3: 83*59= 4907

Q4: 349*683= 238567

Q5: 60,433*7,489= 452,133,057

Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: The shopkeeper owes $40 - $15 = $25. Since you gave an additional $5, the shopkeeper should give you $25 + $5 = $30 in change.

Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 as follows: 12 รท 4 = 3, so 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

Q12: The answer depends on the number of slices each guest gets. If each guest gets one slice, they need 5 slices.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, the discount is 0.20 * $25 = $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours and 45 minutes is equal to 2*60 + 45 = 165 minutes. So there are 165 - 45 = 120 minutes left until 6:30 PM.

Q15: Since a taxi can carry 4 passengers, the number of taxis needed for a group of 22 people is 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a taxi, you need 6 taxis.

Q16: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Since two angles measure 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle is 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
