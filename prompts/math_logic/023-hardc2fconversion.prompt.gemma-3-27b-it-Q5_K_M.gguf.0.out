Okay, let's break down that statement: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

**What it means:**

This is a handy trick for *roughly* converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, specifically around the temperature of 0°C to about 100°C. It states that for every increase of 12°C, the Fahrenheit equivalent will have its digits reversed (or be very close to reversed). It's not a precise conversion formula, but a quick mental estimation tool.

**Let's look at examples:**

* **0°C:**  Fahrenheit is 32°F.  (Not a digit inversion, but it's the starting point)
* **12°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 53.6°F. Notice the digits 5 and 3 are *close* to the reversed digits of 1 and 2.
* **24°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 75.2°F.  Here, 7 and 5 are the reversed digits of 2 and 4.
* **36°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 96.8°F.  9 and 6 are the reversed digits of 3 and 6.
* **48°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 116.4°F. 1 and 16 are close to the reversed digits of 4 and 8.
* **60°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 140°F. 1 and 4 are close to the reversed digits of 6 and 0.
* **72°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 161.6°F. 1 and 6 are close to the reversed digits of 7 and 2.
* **84°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 182.4°F. 1 and 8 are close to the reversed digits of 8 and 4.
* **96°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 202.8°F. 2 and 0 are close to the reversed digits of 9 and 6.
* **108°C:** Fahrenheit is approximately 219.2°F. 2 and 1 are close to the reversed digits of 1 and 0.

**Why does this work (a little explanation)?**

The actual conversion formula is:  °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

The 9/5 factor is close to 2.  So, as Celsius increases, Fahrenheit increases by roughly twice as much. This scaling, combined with the addition of 32, creates the digit-inversion pattern within a certain temperature range.

**Important Caveats:**

* **It's an approximation:** This trick isn't perfectly accurate. The further you get from the 0-100°C range, the less reliable it becomes.
* **Rounding:**  The Fahrenheit values are often rounded, which affects the digit inversion.
* **Not for precise calculations:** Don't use this for scientific or critical applications where accuracy is essential.



In short, it's a fun and easy way to get a *rough* idea of the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature, especially for everyday situations.
