**Problem Setup:**
- Building: 40 stories, each floor 5 m tall.
- Ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F): total height = (40−1)×5 = 195 m.
- Lift:
  - Acceleration/deceleration: a = 1 m/s²
  - Maximum speed: v_max = 5 m/s

**Motion Phases:**
1. **Acceleration:** from 0 to v_max (5 m/s)
   - Time: t₁ = v_max/a = 5/1 = 5 s
   - Distance: s₁ = ½ a t₁² = ½×1×5² = 12.5 m
2. **Deceleration:** from v_max to 0
   - Time: t₃ = t₁ = 5 s
   - Distance: s₃ = s₁ = 12.5 m
3. **Constant speed:** if total distance > s₁ + s₃ = 25 m
   - Distance at constant speed: s₂ = total distance − 25 m
   - Time: t₂ = s₂ / v_max

**Total time:** T = t₁ + t₂ + t₃

---

**1. From 1/F to 40/F (195 m)**

- s₁ + s₃ = 25 m
- s₂ = 195 − 25 = 170 m
- t₂ = 170 / 5 = 34 s
- T = 5 + 34 + 5 = **44 s**

---

**2. Two people: 1st to 10/F, 2nd to 30/F**

**Strategy:** Lift stops at both floors in one trip.

**Option 1:** Stop at 10/F first, then 30/F.

- **Segment 1:** 1/F → 10/F
  - Height = (10−1)×5 = 45 m
  - s₁ + s₃ = 25 m
  - s₂ = 45 − 25 = 20 m
  - t₂ = 20 / 5 = 4 s
  - T₁ = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 s
- **Segment 2:** (stop at 10/F) → 30/F
  - Height = (30−10)×5 = 100 m
  - s₁ + s₃ = 25 m
  - s₂ = 100 − 25 = 75 m
  - t₂ = 75 / 5 = 15 s
  - T₂ = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 s
- **Total time:** T = T₁ (to 10/F) + T₂ (to 30/F) = 14 + 25 = **39 s**

**Option 2:** Stop at 30/F first, then 10/F (not optimal, longer time).

**Conclusion:** Minimum time = **39 s**

---

**3. Two people: 1st to 40/F, 2nd to another floor (not 40/F). Minimum time to 40/F.**

**Strategy:** Lift stops at one intermediate floor (k/F), then 40/F.

Let the intermediate floor be k/F (2 ≤ k ≤ 39).

- **Segment 1:** 1/F → k/F
  - Height = (k−1)×5 m
  - Time T₁ = time to reach k/F (with possible acceleration, constant speed, deceleration)
- **Segment 2:** (stop at k/F) → 40/F
  - Height = (40−k)×5 m
  - Time T₂ = time to reach 40/F from k/F

**Total time:** T = T₁ + T₂

We want to **minimize T** over k.

---

**Key Insight:**

For each segment, the time is minimized if the segment distance is just enough to reach v_max (i.e., ≥25 m). If a segment is <25 m, the lift cannot reach v_max and must accelerate and decelerate over the entire segment, taking longer.

**Optimal k:**

Choose k such that:
- Segment 1: (k−1)×5 ≥ 25 ⇒ k−1 ≥ 5 ⇒ k ≥ 6
- Segment 2: (40−k)×5 ≥ 25 ⇒ 40−k ≥ 5 ⇒ k ≤ 35

So, 6 ≤ k ≤ 35.

For these k:
- Segment 1: (k−1)×5 ≥ 25 ⇒ t₁ = 5 + [(k−1)×5 − 25]/5 + 5 = 5 + (k−6) + 5 = k + 4
- Segment 2: (40−k)×5 ≥ 25 ⇒ t₂ = 5 + [(40−k)×5 − 25]/5 + 5 = 5 + (35−k) + 5 = 45 − k
- **Total time:** T = (k + 4) + (45 − k) = **49 s**

**But wait!** This suggests T is constant (49 s) for all 6 ≤ k ≤ 35. But is this really the minimum?

Let’s check **k = 6** and **k = 35** explicitly:

- **k = 6:**
  - 1/F → 6/F: height = 25 m
    - t₁ = 5 (acc) + 0 (constant) + 5 (dec) = 10 s
  - 6/F → 40/F: height = 170 m
    - t₂ = 5 (acc) + (170−25)/5 + 5 (dec) = 5 + 29 + 5 = 39 s
  - T = 10 + 39 = **49 s**

- **k = 35:**
  - 1/F → 35/F: height = 170 m
    - t₁ = 5 + (170−25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 29 + 5 = 39 s
  - 35/F → 40/F: height = 25 m
    - t₂ = 5 + 0 + 5 = 10 s
  - T = 39 + 10 = **49 s**

**What if k is outside [6,35]?**

- **k = 5:**
  - 1/F → 5/F: height = 20 m (<25 m)
    - Cannot reach v_max. Must accelerate and decelerate over 20 m.
    - Time: t₁ = 2 × √(20/a) = 2 × √20 ≈
