Here is the step-by-step process to construct a mathematical expression that results in 24 using the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) exactly once each:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 / 1) = 24 - 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 1) * 3 - 4 = 9 * 3 - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 - (4 / 1) = 24 - 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying (Same as Attempt 4, acknowledged)
Attempt: 4 * 3 + 8 - 1 = 12 + 8 - 1 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * 3 - 1 = 12 * 3 - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 3) * 1 = 8 * 1 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 1 - 4 = 24 + 1 - 4 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 * (8 - 2) = 4 * 6 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 * (8 - 2) = 4 * 6 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), Correct!
```

**Solution Found**

**Expression:** `4 * (8 - (3 - 1))`

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. Innermost Parenthesis: `3 - 1 = 2`
2. Next Parenthesis: `8 - 2 = 6`
3. Final Calculation: `4 * 6 = 24`

**Numbers Used:** `(4, 8, 3, 1)` - **All numbers used exactly once.** [end of text]
