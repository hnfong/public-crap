Okay, let's solve these math problems.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

Let's try to solve the problem with the given information.

**Question 4: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 5: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 6: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 7: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

1.  **Formula:**  The time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is given by:  `Time = Distance / Acceleration`

2.  **Calculation:**  The ground floor is 1/F, and the top floor is 40/F.  So, the time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:  `Time = 1/F * 40/F = 40/F`

3.  **Answer:** It takes 40/F to get from the ground floor to the top floor.
