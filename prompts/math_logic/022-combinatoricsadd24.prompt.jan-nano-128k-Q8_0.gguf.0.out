Okay, let's see. I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 exactly once each to make 24. Hmm, the user tried some attempts already, but they didn't work. Let me think about different ways to combine these numbers with operations.

First, I remember that 24 can be factored in several ways, like 3*8, 4*6, 12*2, 24*1, etc. Maybe I can find a way to get one of these factors. Let's try 3*8 first. If I can get 3 and 8 multiplied, then I need to somehow make the other numbers (4 and 1) combine to 1 or 0 so that adding or subtracting them doesn't change the result. Wait, but 3*8 is 24, and if I can somehow use 4 and 1 to make 0, then 24 + 0 would work. But how?

Alternatively, maybe using division or subtraction. Let me think. If I take 8 divided by (something) to get a useful number. Wait, maybe 8/(something) multiplied by another number. Let me try different combinations.

Another approach: Let's consider all possible operations. Since we have four numbers, maybe combining two numbers first, then the other two, and then combining those results. For example, (a op b) op (c op d) = 24.

Let me try some possibilities. Let's see:

If I take 8 * 3 = 24. Then I need to use 4 and 1 in a way that doesn't affect the result. But since we have to use all numbers once, maybe 8 * 3 * (4 - 1) / something? Wait, but that would be 8*3*3=72, which is too big. Alternatively, maybe 8 * 3 + (4 - 1) = 24 + 3 = 27, which is not 24. Hmm.

Wait, maybe using subtraction. Like 8 * 3 - (4 - 1) = 24 - 3 = 21. Not enough. What if I do 8 * (3 + 1) - 4? That would be 8*4=32 -4=28. Still not 24.

Alternatively, 8 * (4 - 1) + 3 = 8*3 +3=27. No. Hmm.

What if I try (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7*1=7. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe using division. Let's think. 4 / (1 - 3/8) = 4 divided by (something). Let me compute that denominator: 1 - 3/8 is 5/8. So 4 divided by 5/8 is 4*(8/5) = 32/5 = 6.4. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe (8 * 3) - (4 / 1) = 24 - 4 = 20. No.

Wait, maybe combining numbers differently. Let's think of 4 * 3 * (something). 4*3=12. Then 12 * 2 =24. How can I get 2 from 8 and 1? 8 - 1 - 5? Wait, but I can't use 5. Wait, 8 - 1 =7, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 8 / (something) = 2. If I have 8 divided by 4, that's 2. But then I have 1 left. Wait, but if I do 4 * 3 * (8 / 4) = 12 * 2 =24. But that uses 4 twice. Wait, original numbers are 4,3,1,8. So I can't use 4 twice. So that's not allowed.

Wait, maybe 8 * (4 - (3 - 1))? Let's compute that. 3 -1 is 2, so 4 -2 is 2. Then 8*2=16. Not enough.

Alternatively, 8 * ( (4 + 1) - 3 ) = 8*(5-3)=8*2=16. Still no.

Hmm. What if I try (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 =24. Wait, that's 12*2=24. Let me check the numbers: 8,4,3,1. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So that would be (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Let me verify:

8 + 4 is 12, 3 -1 is 2. 12 * 2 is 24. Yes! That works. But wait, the user tried some attempts before, but maybe they didn't think of this. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, the original numbers are 4,3,1,8. So in this case, using 8 and 4 in the first part, and 3 and 1 in the second part. So all numbers are used once. So that's valid. So the correct expression is (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Let me check again:

8 + 4 = 12, 3 -1 =2, 12*2=24. Yes. So that's the answer. But wait, the user's previous attempts had some errors. Let me make sure that this is the correct one.

But wait, the user's first attempt was (8 -4) * (3 +1) = 4*4=16. Then they tried 8*3 +4 -1=24 +4 -1=27. Then tried 4*(8-3)+4=20 +4=24, but that used 4 twice. So the correct answer is (8 +4) * (3 -1) =24. So that's the solution.

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.
