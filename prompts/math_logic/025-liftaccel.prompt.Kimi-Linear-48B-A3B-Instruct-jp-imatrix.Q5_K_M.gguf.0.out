Let's solve each question step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Building has **40 floors**, each **5 meters** tall.
- Lift starts at **1/F (ground floor)** and goes to **40/F**.
- **Acceleration/deceleration rate**: \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- **Maximum speed**: \( v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

### **Step 1: Total distance**
Each floor is 5 meters, so from 1/F to 40/F is:
\[
(40 - 1) \times 5 = 39 \times 5 = 195 \, \text{meters}
\]

### **Step 2: Use kinematic equations**
We assume the lift accelerates at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) until it reaches **maximum speed**, then decelerates at the same rate.

Let’s find the **time to accelerate to max speed** and **distance covered during acceleration**.

#### **Acceleration phase:**
- \( v = at \Rightarrow 5 = 1 \cdot t \Rightarrow t = 5 \, \text{seconds} \)
- Distance during acceleration:
\[
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
\]

#### **Deceleration phase:**
Same as acceleration: 5 seconds and 12.5 meters.

#### **Constant speed phase:**
- Remaining distance: \( 195 - 2 \cdot 12.5 = 170 \, \text{meters} \)
- Time at constant speed:
\[
\frac{170}{5} = 34 \, \text{seconds}
\]

#### **Total time:**
\[
5 + 34 + 5 = \boxed{44 \, \text{seconds}}
\]

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

### **Step 1: Total distance**
From 1/F to 30/F:
\[
(30 - 1) \times 5 = 29 \times 5 = 145 \, \text{meters}
\]

### **Step 2: Acceleration and deceleration**
Same as before:
- Accelerate: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Decelerate: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Constant speed: \( 145 - 25 = 120 \, \text{m} \Rightarrow \frac{120}{5} = 24 \, \text{s} \)

### **Total time:**
\[
5 + 24 + 5 = \boxed{34 \, \text{seconds}}
\]

---

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### **Step 1: Understand the constraint**
- The lift must **stop at another floor** between 1/F and 40/F **before reaching 40/F**.
- So the lift must **accelerate, decelerate, stop at some floor \( x \), then continue to 40/F**.

### **Step 2: Minimize time**
To **minimize time**, we want to:
- Accelerate to max speed as quickly as possible
- Decelerate as late as possible
- Stop at the **closest possible floor** to 40/F (i.e., 39/F)

So the lift:
- Accelerates to 5 m/s (5 s, 12.5 m)
- Travels at constant speed for some distance
- Decelerates to stop at 39/F

### **Step 3: Distance to 39/F**
From 1/F to 39/F:
\[
(39 - 1) \times 5 = 38 \times 5 = 190 \, \text{meters}
\]

### **Step 4: Time to reach 39/F**
We want to **minimize time**, so we **accelerate to max speed**, then **immediately decelerate** to stop at 39/F.

So:
- Accelerate: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Decelerate: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Constant speed distance: \( 190 - 25 = 165 \, \text{m} \Rightarrow \frac{165}{5} = 33 \, \text{s} \)

### **Total time:**
\[
5 + 33 + 5 = \boxed{43 \, \text{seconds}}
\]

### ✅ Final Answers:
1. **44 seconds**
2. **34 seconds**
3. **43 seconds** [end of text]
