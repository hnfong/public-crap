The statement **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is **incorrect** and is a common misconception or a misremembered mnemonic. It does not work mathematically or logically for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Let's break down why this is wrong, provide the correct formula, and offer a **real** easy way to remember the conversion.

### 1. Why the "Inverted Digits" Rule is Wrong

If we test the claim with real numbers, it fails immediately:

*   **Example A: 12°C**
    *   **Claim:** Invert the digits of 12 $\rightarrow$ **21**.
    *   **Actual Calculation:** $F = (12 \times 1.8) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = \mathbf{53.6^\circ F}$.
    *   **Result:** 21 is not 53.6.

*   **Example B: 24°C** (The next "12" increment)
    *   **Claim:** Invert the digits of 24 $\rightarrow$ **42**.
    *   **Actual Calculation:** $F = (24 \times 1.8) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = \mathbf{75.2^\circ F}$.
    *   **Result:** 42 is not 75.2.

*   **Example C: 30°C**
    *   **Claim:** Invert digits $\rightarrow$ **03** (or 3).
    *   **Actual Calculation:** $F = (30 \times 1.8) + 32 = 54 + 32 = \mathbf{86^\circ F}$.
    *   **Result:** 3 is nowhere near 86.

**Conclusion:** There is no mathematical relationship where multiplying by 1.8 and adding 32 results in simply flipping the digits of the Celsius number.

### 2. The Correct Formula

To convert Celsius ($C$) to Fahrenheit ($F$), you must use this formula:
$$F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$$
*(Or roughly: Double the Celsius number, subtract 10% of that result, then add 32).*

### 3. A Real "Easy Way" to Remember (The "Double and Add 30" Trick)

Since the "inverted digits" rule is false, here is the most popular and accurate **mental math trick** used by meteorologists and travelers:

**The Rule:** **Double the Celsius number, then add 30.**

*   **Why it works:** The exact multiplier is 1.8. Doubling ($ \times 2 $) is very close to 1.8. The exact offset is 32. Adding 30 is very close to 32.
*   **Accuracy:** It is usually off by only 1 or 2 degrees, which is perfect for weather estimates.

#### Examples using the "Double + 30" Trick:

| Celsius | Mental Math (Double + 30) | Exact Calculation | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **10°C** | $10 \times 2 = 20$; $20 + 30 = \mathbf{50}$ | $50^\circ F$ | Exact |
| **20°C** | $20 \times 2 = 40$; $40 + 30 = \mathbf{70}$ | $68^\circ F$ | +2° (Close) |
| **30°C** | $30 \times 2 = 60$; $60 + 30 = \mathbf{90}$ | $86^\circ F$ | +4° (Close) |
| **0°C** | $0 \times 2 = 0$; $0 + 30 = \mathbf{30}$ | $32^\circ F$ | -2° (Close) |

### Summary
The phrase you quoted is a **myth**. Do not use it for calculations. Instead, remember:
> **"Double the Celsius, add 30."**

If you need high precision, use the exact formula: **Multiply by 1.8, then add 32.** [end of text]
