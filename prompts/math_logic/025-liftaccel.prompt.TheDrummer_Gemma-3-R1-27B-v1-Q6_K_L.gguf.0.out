Okay, let's tackle these lift problems step-by-step. This is a classic physics/motion problem with a bit of optimization thrown in.

**Understanding the Problem & Key Concepts**

*   **Constant Acceleration/Deceleration:** The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² to reach its max speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop.
*   **Maximum Speed:** The lift cannot exceed 5 m/s.
*   **Distance:** Each floor is 5 meters tall.  Total height to the 40th floor is 39 floors * 5 m/floor = 195 meters.
*   **Motion Phases:**  The lift's journey will have three phases:
    1.  **Acceleration:** From 0 m/s to max speed.
    2.  **Constant Speed:** At max speed.
    3.  **Deceleration:** From max speed to 0 m/s.

**Question 1: Ground Floor to Top Floor (40/F)**

1.  **Calculate Acceleration Phase:**
    *   Time to reach max speed: `t_accel = v_max / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds`
    *   Distance covered during acceleration: `d_accel = 0.5 * a * t_accel² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters`

2.  **Calculate Deceleration Phase:**
    *   Time to decelerate: `t_decel = v_max / a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds`
    *   Distance covered during deceleration: `d_decel = 0.5 * a * t_decel² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters`

3.  **Calculate Constant Speed Phase:**
    *   Total distance: 195 meters
    *   Distance covered during acceleration and deceleration: `d_accel + d_decel = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters`
    *   Distance covered at constant speed: `d_const = 195 - 25 = 170 meters`
    *   Time at constant speed: `t_const = d_const / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds`

4.  **Total Time:**
    *   `t_total = t_accel + t_const + t_decel = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds`

**Answer 1:** It takes 44 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two People - 10/F and 30/F**

This is trickier. We need to consider the stops.

1.  **Ground Floor to 10/F:**
    *   Distance: 9 floors * 5 m/floor = 45 meters
    *   Check if the lift reaches max speed:
        *   Distance to reach max speed: 12.5 meters (from Q1)
        *   Remaining distance: 45 - 12.5 = 32.5 meters
        *   Since 32.5 > 0, the lift reaches max speed.
    *   Time to accelerate: 5 seconds (from Q1)
    *   Distance at max speed: 45 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 20 meters
    *   Time at max speed: 20 / 5 = 4 seconds
    *   Total time to 10/F: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 seconds

2.  **10/F to 30/F:**
    *   Distance: 20 floors * 5 m/floor = 100 meters
    *   Check if the lift reaches max speed:
        *   Distance to reach max speed: 12.5 meters
        *   Remaining distance: 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters
        *   Since 75 > 0, the lift reaches max speed.
    *   Time to accelerate: 5 seconds
    *   Distance at max speed: 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75 meters
    *   Time at max speed: 75 / 5 = 15 seconds
    *   Total time to 30/F: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds

3.  **Total Time:**
    *   Time to 10/F + Time to 30/F = 14 + 25 = 39 seconds

**Answer 2:** It takes 39 seconds for the lift to reach the 30th floor after the first person gets off at the 10th floor.

**Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with a Stop (Not at 40/F)**

This is an optimization problem. We want to find the floor *between* 1 and 40 that minimizes the total travel time.

1.  **Let's denote the stop floor as 'x' (where 1 < x < 40).**

2.  **Total Time = Time(1->x) + Time(x->40)**

3.  **We need to consider two cases for each segment (1->x and x->40):**
    *   **Case A: The lift reaches max speed.**  This happens if the distance is greater than the acceleration/deceleration distance (12.5 m).
    *   **Case B: The lift does *not* reach max speed.**  This happens if the distance is less than or equal to 12.5 m.

4.  **Let's analyze the time for each segment (1->x and x->40) in both cases:**

    *   **Case A (Reaches Max Speed):**
        *   `t = t_accel + t_const + t_decel = 5 + (d - 25) / 5 + 5 = 10 + (d - 25) / 5 = 10 + d/5 - 5 = 5 + d/5`
    *   **Case B (Does Not Reach Max Speed):**
        *   `t = sqrt(2d/a) = sqrt(2d/1) = sqrt(2d)`  (using the equation of motion: `d = 0.5 * a * t²`)

5.  **Now, we need to determine when the lift reaches max speed for each segment:**

    *   **Segment 1->x:**  Reaches max speed if `d > 25` (where `d = (x-1) * 5`).  So, `5(x-1) > 25`, which means `x-1 > 5`, or `x > 6`.
    *   **Segment x->40:**  Reaches max speed if `d > 25` (where `d = (40-x) * 5`).  So, `5(40-x) > 25`, which means `40-x > 5`, or `x < 35`.

6.  **We have three possible scenarios:**

    *   **Scenario 1: x <= 6 (Both segments don't reach max speed)**
        *   `Total Time = sqrt(2 * 5 * (x-1)) + sqrt(2 * 5 * (40-x)) = sqrt(10(x-1)) + sqrt(10(40-x))`
        *   To minimize, we can take the derivative and set it to zero, but it's easier to test values.  Since the function is
