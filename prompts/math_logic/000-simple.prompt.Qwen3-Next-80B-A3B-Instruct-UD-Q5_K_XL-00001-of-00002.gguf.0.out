Q1: 1+1=**2**  
Q2: 6*7=**42**  
Q3: 83*59=**4897**  
Q4: 349*683=**238,367**  
Q5: 6043*7489=**45,261,027**  
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22  
→ 3x = 15 → x = **5**  
Q7: What is 25% of 80?  
→ 0.25 × 80 = **20**  
Q8: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?  
→ The question doesn’t specify if Tom is included or how many slices per person. But typically, we assume **each person gets one slice**, and Tom is hosting. So: 5 guests + Tom = 6 people → **6 slices**.  
*(Note: If Tom is not eating, then 5. But standard assumption includes host.)* → **6 slices**  
Q9: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?  
→ 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5 → Since you can’t have half a taxi, round up → **6 taxis**  
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?  
→ Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = **4 children**  
*(Note: Katherine is a girl, so the sister mentioned is another girl — so total: Katherine, 1 sister, 2 brothers = 4 children)* → **4 children**  
Q11: Evaluate the expression: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1  
→ Order of operations (PEMDAS):  
12 ÷ 4 = 3  
Then: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5  
→ **5**  
Q12: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?  
→ Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°  
180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = **87 degrees**
