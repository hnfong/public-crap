The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic or memory aid to help people convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit without having to use the exact formula. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

This mnemonic simplifies the conversion process by providing a rough guide for certain temperature points. Here's how it works:

1. **Understand the Pattern**: The idea is that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the Fahrenheit equivalent is approximately the Celsius number with its digits inverted. This is not exact but gives a quick approximation.

2. **Examples**:
   - **0°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(0) + 32 = 32°F \). The digits of 32 are the inversion of 0 (considering 0 as 00).
   - **12°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(12) + 32 = 53.6°F \). The digits 53 are an inversion of 12.
   - **24°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(24) + 32 = 75.2°F \). The digits 75 are an inversion of 24.
   - **36°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(36) + 32 = 96.8°F \). The digits 96 are an inversion of 36.
   - **48°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(48) + 32 = 118.4°F \). The digits 118 are an inversion of 48 (considering 48 as 84).
   - **60°C**: Using the formula, \( F = \frac{9}{5}(60) + 32 = 140°F \). The digits 140 are an inversion of 60 (considering 60 as 06).

3. **Limitations**: This method is a quick approximation and works best for whole numbers. It becomes less accurate as you move away from these specific points or deal with decimal values.

This mnemonic is useful for getting a rough idea of the temperature conversion without needing a calculator, especially in situations where precision is not critical. [end of text]
