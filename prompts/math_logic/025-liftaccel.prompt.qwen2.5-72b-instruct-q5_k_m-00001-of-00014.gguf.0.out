There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

1. **Total Distance:**
   - The building has 40 floors.
   - Each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - Total distance from the ground floor to the top floor: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) meters.

2. **Lift's Motion:**
   - The lift accelerates at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - The maximum speed is \( 5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - The lift decelerates at \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

3. **Time to Reach Maximum Speed:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t_{\text{accel}} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{1 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).

4. **Distance Covered During Acceleration:**
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d_{\text{accel}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times (5 \, \text{seconds})^2 = 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).

5. **Distance Covered During Deceleration:**
   - Distance covered during deceleration: \( d_{\text{decel}} = 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).

6. **Distance Covered at Maximum Speed:**
   - Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration: \( 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Distance covered at maximum speed: \( 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{meters} \).

7. **Time to Cover Distance at Maximum Speed:**
   - Time to cover 175 meters at 5 m/s: \( t_{\text{max}} = \frac{175 \, \text{meters}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 35 \, \text{seconds} \).

8. **Total Time:**
   - Total time: \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{accel}} + t_{\text{max}} + t_{\text{decel}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \, \text{seconds} \).

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **Distance to 10/F:**
   - Distance to 10/F: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{meters} \).

2. **Time to Reach 10/F:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Distance covered at maximum speed: \( 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Time to cover 37.5 meters at 5 m/s: \( t_{\text{max}} = \frac{37.5 \, \text{meters}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 7.5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Total time to 10/F: \( t_{\text{10/F}} = 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 \, \text{seconds} \).

3. **Distance from 10/F to 30/F:**
   - Distance from 10/F to 30/F: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters} \).

4. **Time to Reach 30/F from 10/F:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Distance covered at maximum speed: \( 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Time to cover 87.5 meters at 5 m/s: \( t_{\text{max}} = \frac{87.5 \, \text{meters}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Total time from 10/F to 30/F: \( t_{\text{30/F}} = 5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds} \).

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total time to 30/F: \( t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{10/F}} + t_{\text{30/F}} = 12.5 + 22.5 = 35 \, \text{seconds} \).

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **Distance to 40/F:**
   - Distance to 40/F: \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \, \text{meters} \).

2. **Minimum Time with One Stop:**
   - Let's assume the lift stops at the 20/F (middle floor) for the minimum time calculation.
   - Distance to 20/F: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters} \).

3. **Time to Reach 20/F:**
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Distance covered at maximum speed: \( 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Time to cover 87.5 meters at 5 m/s: \( t_{\text{max}} = \frac{87.5 \, \text{meters}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Total time to 20/F: \( t_{\text{20/F}} = 5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds} \).

4. **Time to Reach 40/F from 20/F:**
   - Distance from 20/F to 40/F: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t_{\text{accel}} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( 12.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Distance covered at maximum speed: \( 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters} \).
   - Time to cover 87.5 meters at 5 m/s: \( t_{\text{max}} = \frac{87.5 \, \text{meters}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Total time from 20/F
