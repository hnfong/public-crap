Actually, the statement —  
> “The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted.”  

— is **not accurate** and is **misleading**. Let me explain why, and then give you the *correct* and *useful* way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions.

### ❌ Why the statement is wrong:
> “Every 12°C, the digits are inverted.”

Let’s test this with examples:

- **12°C** → inverted digits = **21°F**?  
  But 12°C is actually **53.6°F** — not 21°F. ❌

- Try 21°C → inverted digits = 12°F?  
  But 21°C = **69.8°F** — not 12°F. ❌

- Try 13°C → inverted = 31°F?  
  13°C = **55.4°F** — not 31°F. ❌

So the claim “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” is **completely false**. It doesn’t work for any example.

### ✅ What *actually* works: A Simple Rule of Thumb

Here’s a **real, useful, and accurate** way to estimate Celsius to Fahrenheit:

> **“Double the Celsius, then add 30.”**

This gives you a **good approximation** for everyday use.

#### Examples:
- **20°C** → 20 × 2 = 40 + 30 = **70°F**  
  → Actual: 68°F → **Very close!**

- **10°C** → 10×2=20 +30 = **50°F**  
  → Actual: 50°F → **Perfect!**

- **25°C** → 25×2=50 +30 = **80°F**  
  → Actual: 77°F → Close enough for weather!

- **0°C** → 0×2 +30 = **30°F**  
  → Actual: 32°F → Very close!

### ✅ The Real Formula (for precision):
If you want the *exact* conversion:  
> **°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32**

Example:  
20°C → (20 × 9/5) + 32 = 36 + 32 = **68°F**

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Double + 30** | Quick, easy estimate for weather (within 2–5°F of actual) |
| **°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32** | Exact conversion — use for science, cooking, or precision |

---

### ❌ So, the original claim — “every 12°C, the digits are inverted” — is **false and misleading**.

There is **no pattern** where 12°C = 21°F or 21°C = 12°F. That’s just not how temperature conversion works.

✅ Stick with: **Double and add 30** for quick estimates — it’s reliable, simple, and actually works. [end of text]
