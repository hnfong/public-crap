Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I get each answer right. Let's start with Q1.

Q1: 1+1=?
That's straightforward. 1 plus 1 is 2. Easy.

Q2: 6*7=?
6 times 7. Let me recall, 6*7 is 42. Yeah, that's right.

Q3: 83*59=?
Hmm, multiplying two numbers. Let me do this step by step. Maybe break it down. 80*59 and 3*59, then add them together. 80*59 is 4720 (since 80*60=4800, minus 80 is 4720). Then 3*59 is 177. So 4720 + 177 = 4897. Wait, let me check that again. 83*59. Alternatively, 59*80=4720, 59*3=177, so total 4720+177=4897. Yeah, that seems right.

Q4: 349*683=?
This is a bigger multiplication. Let me see. Maybe use the standard algorithm. Let's write it out:

   349
x 683
--------
First, multiply 349 by 3: 349*3=1047
Then, 349*80=27920 (since 349*8=2792, so *10 is 27920)
Then, 349*600=209400 (349*6=2094, *100=209400)
Now add them up: 1047 + 27920 = 28967; then 28967 + 209400 = 238,367. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 349*683. Let's verify with another method. Maybe 350*683 = 239,050, then subtract 1*683, so 239,050 - 683 = 238,367. Yeah, that matches. So 238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
Oh wow, that's a big one. Let me think. Maybe use a calculator approach, but since I can't, I need to do it step by step. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate, but the question probably expects the exact answer. Let's try breaking it down.

First, 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000
6043 * 400 = 2,417,200
6043 * 80 = 483,440
6043 * 9 = 54,387

Now add them all together:

42,301,000
+ 2,417,200 = 44,718,200
+ 483,440 = 45,201,640
+ 54,387 = 45,256,027

Wait, let me check that again. Let's verify each part:

6043 * 7000: 6043*7=42,301, so *1000 is 42,301,000. Correct.

6043 * 400: 6043*4=24,172, so *100=2,417,200. Correct.

6043 * 80: 6043*8=48,344, so *10=483,440. Correct.

6043 * 9: 6043*9. Let's compute 6000*9=54,000 and 43*9=387, so total 54,387. Correct.

Now adding them up:

42,301,000
+ 2,417,200 = 44,718,200
44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640
45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027.

Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe 6043*7489. Let's see, 7489 is 7000 + 400 + 80 + 9, so the breakdown is correct. So the answer should be 45,256,027. I think that's right.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
Okay, solve for x. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15. Then divide by 3: x = 15/3 = 5. So x=5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% is a quarter, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
Let's break this down. The book costs $15. The customer gives two 20s, which is $40, and then an additional $5, so total given is $40 + $5 = $45. The cost is $15, so the change should be $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but the question says "she does not have exact change," so maybe the shopkeeper can't give exact change with the two 20s, so the customer adds a 5. Wait, but the customer gives two 20s (total $40) and then an additional $5, so total $45. The book is $15, so change is $45 - $15 = $30. So the shopkeeper should give back $30. Let me make sure. The customer pays $45 for a $15 item, so change is $30. That seems right.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine is one child. She has two brothers and a sister, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 siblings. So total children: 1 (Katherine) + 3 siblings = 4. So the mother has 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So the answer is 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
Hmm, the question is a bit vague. Typically, each person gets one slice, but it doesn't specify. If there are 5 guests, and assuming Tom is also there, that's 6 people. But the question says "5 guests have arrived," so maybe Tom is the host, so total people are 5 guests + Tom = 6. But the question is asking how many slices they need. If it's a standard birthday cake, maybe each guest gets one slice, so 5 slices. But sometimes hosts might have a slice too. Wait, the question says "5 guests have arrived," so maybe the number of slices needed is 5. But the problem doesn't specify if Tom is included. The question is a bit ambiguous, but usually, when they say "guests," the host isn't counted as a guest. So 5 guests, so 5 slices. But maybe the question expects 5. Wait, but sometimes birthday cakes are cut into slices per person, so if there are 5 guests, they need 5 slices. I think that's the intended answer.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
20% off means you pay 80% of the original price. So 25 * 0.8 = 20. So $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
Let's calculate the time difference. From 3:45 PM to 6:45 PM is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But we need until 6:30 PM, which is 15 minutes before 6:45. So 180 - 15 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, from 3:45 to 6:30. Let's do it step by step. From 3:45 to 4:45 is 60 minutes. 4:45 to 5:45 is another 60, so 120 minutes. Then 5:45 to 6:30 is 45 minutes. So total 120 + 45 = 165 minutes. Yes, that's correct.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
Divide 22 by 4. 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up to 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis would carry 20 people, leaving 2 people, so you need a 6th taxi.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So 31 + 62 = 93. 180 - 93 = 87. So the third angle is 87 degrees.

Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Q1: 2. Correct.

Q2: 42. Correct.

Q3: 83*59. Let's verify 83*60=4980, minus 83 is 4980-83=4897. Yes, that's right.

Q4: 349*683. Earlier calculation gave 238,367. Let me check with another method. 349*600=209,400; 349*80=27,920; 349*3=1,047. Adding those: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320; 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367. Correct.

Q5: 6043*7489. Let's see, 6043*7000=42,301,000; 6043*400=2,417,200; 6043*80=483,440; 6043*9=54,387. Adding up: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200; +483,440 = 45,201,640; +54,387 = 45,256,027. That seems correct.

Q6: 3x +7=22. 3x=15, x=5. Correct.

Q7: 25% of 80 is 20. Correct.

Q8: Total paid $45, cost $15, change $30. Correct.

Q9: Perimeter 4*5=20. Correct.

Q10: Katherine has 2 brothers, 1 sister, so total 4 children. Correct.

Q11: 3 + 12/4 -1 = 3 +3 -1=5. Correct.

Q12: 5 guests, so 5 slices. Assuming each guest gets one slice. The question is a bit ambiguous, but that's the standard assumption. So 5.

Q13: 20% off $25 is $5 off, so $20. Correct.

Q14: 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours and 45 minutes. 2*60=120 +45=165 minutes. Correct.

Q15: 22 people, 4 per taxi. 22/4=5.5, so 6 taxis. Correct.

Q16: 31+62=93, 180-93=87. Correct.

I think all of these are right. Let me just check Q12 again. The question says "5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" If it's a birthday party, sometimes the host (Tom) is included, but the question says "they" which refers to the guests. So 5 guests, so 5 slices. If it's the total people, it would be 6, but the question specifies "they" which are the guests. So 5. That's probably the answer they're looking for.

Okay, I think all answers are correct.
