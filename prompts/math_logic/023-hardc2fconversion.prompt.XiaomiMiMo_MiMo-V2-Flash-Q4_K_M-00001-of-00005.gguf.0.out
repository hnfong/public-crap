<think>Okay, the user is asking about a memory trick for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit where "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." They want an explanation with examples and allow restarting if needed. 

First, I need to unpack what "digits inverted" means. It's clearly about reversing the number's digits, like turning 12 into 21 or 24 into 42. But the phrasing "every 12°C" suggests this might be a stepwise pattern rather than a direct conversion. 

Hmm... the standard formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. If we ignore the +32 and 9/5 for a moment, could there be a digit-reversal pattern at specific Celsius values? Let me test some conversions:

- 12°C → 53.6°F. Reversing 12 gives 21, which isn't close to 53.6. 
- 24°C → 75.2°F. Reversing 24 gives 42, still not matching. 
- 42°C → 107.6°F. Reversing 42 gives 24, no match. 

This isn't working. Maybe the user meant something else? Perhaps it's about approximating temperatures where the Fahrenheit digits happen to reverse the Celsius digits? 

Let me search for Celsius values where F ≈ reversed C digits:
- 10°C → 50°F. Reversed 10 is 01, not 50. 
- 21°C → 69.8°F ≈ 70°F. Reversed 21 is 12, not 70. 
- 42°C → 107.6°F ≈ 108°F. Reversed 42 is 24, not 108. 

Still no luck. Maybe it's about differences? Like every 12°C increase causes the Fahrenheit digits to reverse? 

Testing increases:
- From 12°C (53.6°F) to 24°C (75.2°F): digits 53.6 → 75.2. Reversed? 635 → 257? No. 
- From 24°C to 36°C (96.8°F): 75.2 → 96.8. Reversed? 257 → 869? No. 

This memory trick seems flawed. Perhaps the user misremembered it? I recall a better approximation: F ≈ (C × 2) + 30. For example:
- 12°C → 2×12 +30 = 54°F (actual 53.6°F). 
- 24°C → 48+30=78°F (actual 75.2°F). 

But this doesn't involve digit reversal. 

Another possibility: maybe "digits inverted" refers to the 9/5 ratio in the formula? 9/5 = 1.8, and reversing digits of 18 gives 81, but 81 isn't relevant. 

Perhaps it's about specific Celsius values where the conversion yields a reversed digit pattern by coincidence? Let me find such cases:
- 15°C → 59°F. Reversed 15 is 51, not 59. 
- 16°C → 60.8°F ≈ 61. Reversed 16 is 61. Oh! 16°C → 60.8°F ≈ 61°F, and reversing 16 gives 61. 

Similarly:
- 26°C → 78.8°F ≈ 79. Reversed 26 is 62, not 79. 
- 36°C → 96.8°F ≈ 97. Reversed 36 is 63, not 97. 

Only 16°C works. What about higher? 
- 61°C → 141.8°F ≈ 142. Reversed 61 is 16, not 142. 
- 62°C → 143.6°F ≈ 144. Reversed 62 is 26, not 144. 

No match. Maybe 42°C? 107.6°F ≈ 108, reversed 42 is 24. No. 

Perhaps it's about the difference between digits? For example:
- 12°C → 53.6°F. Digits 5 and 3.6. Reversed? 3.6 → 63? Not 53. 

This memory trick appears unreliable. I should explain why it doesn't work and offer a better approximation. 

The user might be frustrated if they've been relying on this trick. I'll acknowledge it's a remembered phrase but clarify its inaccuracy, then provide a practical alternative like "double Celsius and add 30" for quick estimates. 

For exact conversions, I'll emphasize the full formula. Examples will show how the digit inversion fails at common temperatures like 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, etc., while the approximation method works reasonably well. 

Finally, I'll suggest checking reversed-digit cases like 16°C as rare coincidences, not a general rule. The goal is to turn their confusion into a learning opportunity about temperature conversion.</think>The memory trick "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" **is not accurate for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit**. It seems like a misremembered or oversimplified rule that doesn't work reliably. Let me explain why it fails and offer a better method.

### Why the "12°C Inversion" Rule Doesn't Work:
1. **Testing the Rule**:  
   - **12°C → 53.6°F**: Reversing "12" gives "21", but 53.6 ≠ 21.  
   - **24°C → 75.2°F**: Reversing "24" gives "42", but 75.2 ≠ 42.  
   - **42°C → 107.6°F**: Reversing "42" gives "24", but 107.6 ≠ 24.  
   **Result**: The Fahrenheit value never matches the reversed Celsius digits.

2. **Possible Origin of the Rule**:  
   It might be a misremembered version of a **coincidence at 16°C**:  
   - 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ **61°F**.  
   - Reversing "16" gives "61".  
   This is a rare exception, not a general rule.

### A Better Method: The "Double and Add 30" Approximation
For quick estimates:  
**Fahrenheit ≈ (2 × Celsius) + 30**  

#### Examples:
| Celsius | Estimate Formula | Estimated F | Actual F | Accuracy |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **0°C**  | (2×0) + 30 = 30   | 30°F         | 32°F     | Close    |
| **10°C** | (2×10) + 30 = 50  | 50°F         | 50°F     | Exact    |
| **20°C** | (2×20) + 30 = 70  | 70°F         | 68°F     | Close    |
| **30°C** | (2×30) + 30 = 90  | 90°F         | 86°F     | Close    |
| **40°C** | (2×40) + 30 = 110 | 110°F        | 104°F    | Fair     |

#### Why This Works:
- The exact formula is **F = (C × 1.8) + 32**.  
- "Double and add 30" simplifies to **F ≈ (2C + 30)**.  
- It’s accurate within ±5°F for everyday temperatures (0°C–40°C).

### Exact Conversion Formula
Use this for precision:  
**Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32**  

#### Examples:
- **12°C**: (12 × 1.8) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = **53.6°F**  
- **24°C**: (24 × 1.8) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = **75.2°F**  
- **42°C**: (42 × 1.8) + 32 = 75.6 + 32 = **107.6°F**  

---

### Conclusion:
The "12°C inversion" rule **is not mathematically valid**. It only coincidentally works for 16°C (→ 61°F). For reliable conversions:  
1. **Quick estimate**: Use **(2 × C) + 30**.  
2. **Exact conversion**: Use **(C × 1.8) + 32**.  

If you encountered this rule elsewhere, it might be a niche trick for specific temperatures, but it’s not a general solution. Always verify with the exact formula! [end of text]
