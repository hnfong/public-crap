Okay, let's tackle these three questions one by one. Starting with Q1: What's the significance of the number 120 and its interesting properties. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about 120. First, 120 is a factorial, right? 5 factorial is 120 because 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. That's a key point. Also, 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me check that. The divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. Yeah, that's 16 divisors. I think numbers like 60, 120, 180 are highly composite. Wait, 60 has 12 divisors, so 120 has more, so that's correct.

Another property: 120 is a pronic number, which is the product of two consecutive integers. Let's see, 10×12=120, but wait, pronic numbers are n(n+1). So 10×11=110, 11×12=132, so 120 isn't a pronic number. Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Wait, 120 is 5×24, 6×20, 8×15, 10×12. Maybe it's a triangular number? Triangular numbers are n(n+1)/2. Let's check: 15×16/2=120, yes! So 15th triangular number is 120. Because 15×16=240, divided by 2 is 120. So that's a triangular number.

Also, 120 is a tetrahedral number. Tetrahedral numbers are the sum of triangular numbers. The formula is n(n+1)(n+2)/6. Let's see, for n=8: 8×9×10/6=720/6=120. Yes, so 8th tetrahedral number is 120. That's another property.

Wait, 120 is also a factorial, as I thought earlier. 5! = 120. So that's a significant property. Also, in some contexts, 120 is used in time, like 120 minutes is 2 hours, but maybe that's not a mathematical property. Wait, but the question is about mathematical significance. Let me confirm the factorial: 5! = 120, correct. 4! is 24, 5! is 120, 6! is 720. So 120 is 5 factorial.

Another thing: 120 is a refactorable number, meaning it's divisible by the count of its divisors. The number of divisors is 16, and 120 divided by 16 is 7.5, which is not an integer. Wait, so maybe that's not right. Wait, refactorable numbers are numbers that are divisible by the number of their divisors. So if a number has d divisors, then n/d must be integer. For 120, d=16, 120/16=7.5, so not integer. So 120 is not refactorable. Maybe I confused that with another property.

Wait, 120 is a multiple of 10, 12, 15, etc. Also, 120 is the smallest number that is the product of three consecutive primes? Wait, 2×3×5=30, 3×5×7=105, 5×7×11=385, so no. 120 is 2^3×3×5. So prime factorization is 2³×3×5. So that's another property.

Also, 120 is a Harshad number, which means it's divisible by the sum of its digits. Sum of digits: 1+2+0=3. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is integer. So yes, 120 is a Harshad number. That's a good point.

Wait, let me check if there are other properties. Maybe in geometry? 120 degrees is a common angle, like in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. But that's more of a geometric context. The question says "interesting properties," so maybe that's relevant. Also, 120 is the number of degrees in the internal angle of a regular hexagon. Wait, regular hexagon has internal angles of (6-2)*180/6 = 120 degrees. So that's a geometric property.

Another thing: 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects in a circle, but wait, circular permutations are (n-1)! So for 5 objects, it's 4! = 24. So that's not 120. Wait, but linear permutations are 5! = 120. So 120 is the number of permutations of 5 distinct items. That's a key point. So 5! = 120, which is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects in a line.

Also, 120 is a factorial, so it's part of the factorial sequence. Let me list some factorials: 1!=1, 2!=2, 3!=6, 4!=24, 5!=120, 6!=720. So 120 is the 5th factorial.

Wait, another property: 120 is a pronic number? Wait, pronic numbers are n(n+1). Let's see, 10×11=110, 11×12=132, so 120 isn't between them. So no, 120 isn't pronic. But it's a triangular number, as 15×16/2=120. So that's correct.

Also, 120 is a multiple of 10, 12, 15, 20, etc. Let me confirm the divisors again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. Yep, 16 divisors. So it's a highly composite number because it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let's check numbers below 120. For example, 60 has 12 divisors, 84 has 12 divisors, 90 has 12 divisors, 96 has 12 divisors, 100 has 9 divisors, 108 has 12 divisors, 112 has 10 divisors, 120 has 16. So yes, 120 is the first number with 16 divisors, so it's highly composite.

So summarizing Q1: 120 is 5 factorial (5!), the 15th triangular number, the 8th tetrahedral number, a highly composite number, a Harshad number (divisible by sum of digits 1+2+0=3), and the internal angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees. Also, it's the number of permutations of 5 distinct objects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe 120 is a factorial, which is a key point. Also, in some contexts, 120 is used as a base, but I don't think that's a standard property. So those should be the main properties.

Moving on to Q2: Solve the equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0. Alright, quadratic equation. Let's recall that to solve ax² + bx + c = 0, we can use factoring, completing the square, or quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first. We need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. Wait, the equation is x² -7x -18=0, so a=1, b=-7, c=-18. So looking for two numbers m and n such that m*n = a*c = 1*(-18) = -18, and m + n = b = -7. Wait, actually, when factoring, we need two numbers that multiply to c (which is -18) and add to b (which is -7). Wait, no, for ax² + bx + c, if a=1, then we need two numbers that multiply to c and add to b. So here, c is -18, b is -7. So we need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. Let's list the factor pairs of -18: (1, -18), (2, -9), (3, -6), (6, -3), (9, -2), (18, -1). Now check which pair adds to -7. Let's see: 2 + (-9) = -7. Yes, that's it. So 2 and -9. So the equation factors as (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0. Wait, let's check: (x + 2)(x - 9) = x² -9x + 2x -18 = x² -7x -18. Perfect, that's correct. So setting each factor to zero: x + 2 = 0 => x = -2; x - 9 = 0 => x = 9. So the solutions are x = -2 and x = 9.

Alternatively, using the quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2 = [7 ± 11]/2. So (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, and (7 - 11)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. Same answers. So that's correct.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

First, let's clarify what a round trip is. A round trip from city A to city B and back to city A. So the distance for one round trip is 200 km (to B) + 200 km (back to A) = 400 km.

The train's speed is 60 km/h. So time taken for one round trip is distance divided by speed: 400 km / 60 km/h = 400/60 hours = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666... hours.

A full day is 24 hours. So the number of round trips is total time divided by time per round trip: 24 hours / (20/3 hours per trip) = 24 * (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6.

But the question is asking how many round trips it can make. Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to take the integer part. So 3 full round trips, and 0.6 of a trip, which isn't a full trip. So the answer should be 3.

Wait, let me double-check. Distance one way: 200 km. Time one way: 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours. So round trip time: 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours. Total time in a day: 24 hours. Number of round trips: 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6. So 3 full trips, since 3 trips take 3*(20/3)=20 hours, and 4 trips would take 4*(20/3)=80/3≈26.666 hours, which is more than 24. So yes, 3 round trips.

Wait, but let me confirm if "within a full day" means exactly 24 hours, so the maximum integer number of trips that fit into 24 hours. So 3.6, so 3. So the answer is 3.

Wait, but let me check if the problem says "round trips," so each round trip is going and coming back. So yes, 400 km per round trip. Speed 60 km/h, so time per round trip is 400/60 = 20/3 hours. 24 divided by (20/3) is 3.6, so 3 full trips. That seems right.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. 20/3 hours per round trip. 3 round trips would take 3*(20/3)=20 hours. Then there's 4 hours left. 4 hours at 60 km/h is 240 km. But a round trip is 400 km, so 240 km is less than 400, so it can't complete another round trip. So yes, only 3 full round trips.

So the answers are:

Q1: 120 is 5 factorial (5! = 120), the 15th triangular number (15×16/2 = 120), the 8th tetrahedral number (8×9×10/6 = 120), a highly composite number (has 16 divisors, more than any smaller number), a Harshad number (120 ÷ (1+2+0) = 40, integer), and the internal angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees.

Q2: The solutions are x = -2 and x = 9.

Q3: 3 round trips.

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**  
The number **120** has several significant mathematical properties:

1. **Factorial**:  
   $ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 $.  
   This makes it the **5th factorial number**.

2. **Triangular Number**:  
   The $ n $-th triangular number is given by $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $.  
   For $ n = 15 $:  
   $$
   \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120
   $$  
   So, **120 is the 15th triangular number**.

3. **Tetrahedral Number**:  
   The $ n $-th tetrahedral number is given by $ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} $.  
   For $ n = 8 $:  
   $$
   \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6} = 120
   $$  
   Thus, **120 is the 8th tetrahedral number**.

4. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   A highly composite number has more divisors than any smaller number.  
   Divisors of 120: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 $ (total of **16 divisors**).  
   No smaller number has as many divisors, so **120 is a highly composite number**.

5. **Harshad Number**:  
   A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits.  
   Sum of digits of 120: $ 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 $.  
   $ 120 \div 3 = 40 $, which is an integer.  
   Hence, **120 is a Harshad number**.

6. **Geometric Significance**:  
   In a regular hexagon, each internal angle measures **120 degrees**.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step-by-step Solution:**

We solve the quadratic equation using **factoring**.

1. Identify two numbers that multiply to $ -18 $ (the constant term) and add to $ -7 $ (the coefficient of $ x $).  
   These numbers are $ 2 $ and $ -9 $, since:  
   $$
   2 \times (-9) = -18 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 + (-9) = -7
   $$

2. Factor the quadratic:  
   $$
   x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0
   $$

3. Set each factor equal to zero:  
   $$
   x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
   $$
   $$
   x - 9 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 9
   $$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{-2 \text{ and } 9}
$$

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Distance for one round trip**:  
   One way = 200 km, so a round trip = $ 2 \times 200 = 400 $ km.

2. **Time for one round trip**:  
   Speed = 60 km/h, so time = $ \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} $ hours ≈ 6.666... hours.

3. **Total time available in a full day**:  
   $ 24 $ hours.

4. **Number of round trips**:  
   $$
   \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   $$

5. **Interpretation**:  
   Since only full round trips count, we take the **integer part** of 3.6, which is **3**.

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{3}
