**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 is a highly composite number with many interesting mathematical and practical properties:

1. **Factorial**: \(5! = 120\). This is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 5.
2. **Divisors**: 120 has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it a "highly composite number."
3. **Triangular and tetrahedral number**: 120 is both a triangular number (the sum of the first 15 integers: \(1+2+...+15 = 120\)) and a tetrahedral number (the sum of the first 5 triangular numbers: \(1+3+6+10+15 = 120\)).
4. **Harshad number**: 120 is divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0=3), so it's a Harshad number in base 10.
5. **In geometry**: The interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720°, which is 6 × 120°.
6. **In time**: There are 120 minutes in 2 hours, and 120 seconds in 2 minutes.
7. **In the Bible**: 120 is mentioned as the age to which Moses lived (Deuteronomy 34:7).
8. **In sports**: In cricket, 120 runs is called a "century" in the sport of baseball? No, that's not right. Actually, in cricket, a "century" is 100 runs. But 120 is a common target in some limited-overs cricket matches (a "par score").
9. **In music**: An octave is divided into 1200 cents, and standard tempo marking "Allegro" is often around 120 beats per minute.
10. **In the human body**: There are 120 working days in a typical school year in some countries? No, that's not a universal fact.
