"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

You are absolutely right to question that! The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is **incorrect and a common misconception**. It’s a trick that *almost* works, but it has a significant flaw. 

Let’s break down the correct conversion and then address why the “inverted digits” trick is misleading.

**The Correct Conversion Formula:**

* **Fahrenheit to Celsius:**  F = (C - 32) * 5/9
* **Celsius to Fahrenheit:** C = (F * 9/5) + 32

**Let’s look at some examples:**

* **0°C to Fahrenheit:** (0 * 9/5) + 32 = 32°F
* **10°C to Fahrenheit:** (10 * 9/5) + 32 = 26°F
* **20°C to Fahrenheit:** (20 * 9/5) + 32 = 44°F
* **30°C to Fahrenheit:** (30 * 9/5) + 32 = 54°F
* **-10°C to Fahrenheit:** (-10 * 9/5) + 32 = 14°F


**Why the "Inverted Digits" Trick is Wrong**

The "inverted digits" trick suggests that every 12°C, the Celsius and Fahrenheit numbers swap places.  Let's test it:

* **12°C:**  This *should* be 54°F (as we calculated above).  The digits are *not* inverted.
* **24°C:** This *should* be 77°F. Again, not inverted.
* **36°C:** This *should* be 99°F. Still not inverted.

**The *Real* Pattern (and a better mnemonic)**

The actual relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more nuanced.  Here's a better way to think about it, and a mnemonic to help:

* **Freezing Point of Water:** 0°C = 32°F
* **Boiling Point of Water:** 100°C = 212°F

Notice that for every 10°C increase, there's a 18°F increase.  (10°C = 18°F)

**A more helpful mnemonic:**

"**F**reezing is **32** degrees, **B**oiling is **212** degrees."

**In short, the "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" rule is a misleading shortcut and doesn't accurately represent the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.**
