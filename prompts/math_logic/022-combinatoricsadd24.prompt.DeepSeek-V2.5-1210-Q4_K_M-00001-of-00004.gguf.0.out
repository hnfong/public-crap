```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 1 = 4 * 5 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 / (1 - (3 / 4)) = 8 / (1 - 0.75) = 8 / 0.25 = 32, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - (4 - 1)) * 3 = (8 - 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 - (4 / 1)) = 8 * (3 - 4) = 8 * (-1) = -8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
