The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is **not accurate**. There is no general rule that the digits of a Celsius temperature are inverted when converted to Fahrenheit. This claim appears to be a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

---

### **Why the Statement is Incorrect**
The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are linearly related, but their conversion formula is not based on digit inversion. The correct formula is:

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
$$

This means that for any Celsius temperature $ C $, the Fahrenheit temperature $ F $ is calculated by multiplying $ C $ by $ \frac{9}{5} $ and adding 32. There is **no inherent relationship** between the digits of $ C $ and $ F $, and no periodic pattern (like every 12°C) causes digits to invert.

### **Examples to Disprove the Claim**
Let’s test the claim with a few examples:

1. **12°C**  
   - Celsius: 12  
   - Fahrenheit: $ \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6 $  
   - Digits of Fahrenheit: **5, 3, 6**  
   - Digits of Celsius: **1, 2**  
   - **Digits are not inverted** (12 → 53.6).

2. **24°C**  
   - Celsius: 24  
   - Fahrenheit: $ \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2 $  
   - Digits of Fahrenheit: **7, 5, 2**  
   - Digits of Celsius: **2, 4**  
   - **Digits are not inverted** (24 → 75.2).

3. **36°C**  
   - Celsius: 36  
   - Fahrenheit: $ \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8 $  
   - Digits of Fahrenheit: **9, 6, 8**  
   - Digits of Celsius: **3, 6**  
   - **Digits are not inverted** (36 → 96.8).

4. **48°C**  
   - Celsius: 48  
   - Fahrenheit: $ \frac{9}{5} \times 48 + 32 = 86.4 + 32 = 118.4 $  
   - Digits of Fahrenheit: **1, 1, 8, 4**  
   - Digits of Celsius: **4, 8**  
   - **Digits are not inverted** (48 → 118.4).

### **What Might the Statement Mean?**
If the statement is meant to be a **mnemonic** or a **pattern**, it might be referring to **specific cases** where the digits of Celsius and Fahrenheit are related in a way that could be interpreted as "inverted" (e.g., 12°C → 53.6°F, where 12 and 53.6 are not directly related). However, this is not a general rule and does not hold for most temperatures.

---

### **Correct Way to Remember Celsius to Fahrenheit**
The standard formula is:

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
$$

Alternatively, you can use the **"double and add 30"** approximation for quick mental math (e.g., 20°C → 68°F, 25°C → 77°F). This is not exact but works for rough estimates.

---

### **Conclusion**
The claim that "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is **not a valid rule** for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. The relationship between the two scales is linear and based on the formula $ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $, not digit inversion. Always verify conversions using the correct formula or a reliable calculator. [end of text]
