<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer each question. Provide answers. Let's compute.

Q1: 1+1=2.

Q2: 6*7=42.

Q3: 83*59. Compute: 83*60=4980, minus 83 = 4897. So answer 4897.

Q4: 349*683. Compute: 349*683 = 349*(600+80+3) = 349*600=209400; 349*80=27920; 349*3=1047. Sum = 209400+27920=237320; +1047=238367. So answer 238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489. Compute. Let's do multiplication: 6043 * 7489.

We can compute using breakdown: 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000 (since 6043*7=42,301 then *1000). Actually 6043*7000 = 6043*7*1000 = 42,301*1000 = 42,301,000.

6043 * 400 = 2,417,200 (6043*4=24,172 then *100). Wait 6043*400 = 6043*4*100 = 24,172*100 = 2,417,200.

6043 * 80 = 483,440 (6043*8=48,344 then *10 = 483,440).

6043 * 9 = 54,387.

Now sum: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200.
Add 483,440 => 45,201,640.
Add 54,387 => 45,256,027.

Thus answer 45,256,027.

Check: 7489 = 7000+400+80+9 correct.

So Q5 answer 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7: 3x = 15 => x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25*80 = 20.

Q8: Book costs $15. Pay with two $20 bills = $40, but shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so you give an additional $5 bill (so total $45). Change = amount paid - cost = $45 - $15 = $30. So final change $30.

Q9: Perimeter of square side 5 units = 4*5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine herself plus 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. Wait sister is also a child. So total children = Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4. So answer 4.

Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then expression: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So answer 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Usually each guest gets a slice, maybe also Tom? The question ambiguous. Likely need 5 slices for 5 guests. Could also include Tom, making 6. But typical reading: "5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?" Probably 5 slices. I'll answer 5.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. Discount = 0.20*25 = $5. Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM, minutes until 6:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours 45 minutes? Let's compute: 3:45 to 4:45 = 60 min, to 5:45 = another 60 (total 120), to 6:30 = 45 minutes. So total 60+60+45 = 165 minutes. So answer 165 minutes.

Q15: Taxi can carry 4 passengers. Group of 22 people. Number of taxis needed = ceil(22/4) = 5.5 => 6 taxis. So answer 6.

Q16: Triangle angles: 31° + 62° = 93°. Third angle = 180° - 93° = 87°. So answer 87°.

Now produce answer list.

Potential ambiguous Q12: I'll note ambiguous but give answer 5.

Let's format as list.
