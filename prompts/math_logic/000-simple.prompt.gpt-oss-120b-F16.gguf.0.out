<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer each question. Provide answers. Let's compute.

Q1: 1+1=2.

Q2: 6*7=42.

Q3: 83*59. Compute: 83*59 = 83*60 - 83 = 4980 - 83 = 4897.

Q4: 349*683. Compute: 349*683 = 349*(600+80+3) = 349*600=209400; 349*80=27920; 349*3=1047. Sum = 209400+27920=237320; +1047=238367.

Check: 349*683 =? Let's verify using alternative: 683*349. 683*300=204900; 683*40=27320; 683*9=6147; sum=204900+27320=232220; +6147=238367. Yes.

Q5: 6043*7489. Compute large multiplication. Let's do using breakdown: 7489*6043.

We can compute using Python mental? Let's do stepwise.

6043 * 7489 = 6043*(7000 + 400 + 80 + 9) = 6043*7000 + 6043*400 + 6043*80 + 6043*9.

6043*7000 = 6043*7*1000 = 42,301 *1000? Wait 6043*7 = 42,301? Let's compute: 6,043*7 = 42,301 (yes). So *1000 => 42,301,000.

6043*400 = 6043*4*100 = 24,172*100 = 2,417,200.

6043*80 = 6043*8*10 = 48,344*10 = 483,440.

6043*9 = 54,387.

Now sum: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200.
Add 483,440 => 45,201,640.
Add 54,387 => 45,256,027.

Thus answer: 45,256,027.

Check quickly using alternative: 7489*6043. Could also compute 7489*6000 = 44,934,000; 7489*40 = 299,560; 7489*3 = 22,467. Sum = 44,934,000+299,560=45,233,560; +22,467=45,256,027. Yes matches.

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7: 3x = 15 => x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25*80 = 20.

Q8: Book costs $15. Pay with two $20 bills = $40, then additional $5 bill = $45 total given. Change = $45 - $15 = $30. Wait but scenario: She gives two $20 bills, shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so you give an additional $5 bill. So total given $45. Change $30. So answer $30.

Q9: Perimeter of square side 5 units = 4*5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. So answer 4.

Q11: Evaluate 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then expression: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So answer 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Usually each guest gets a slice, maybe also Tom? The question ambiguous. It says 5 guests have arrived. How many slices do they need? Could be 5 slices (one per guest). Might also include Tom. But typical answer: 5 slices. We'll answer 5.

Q13: Shirt originally $25, 20% off. Discount = 0.20*25 = $5. Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM, minutes left until 6:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours 45 minutes? Let's compute: 3:45 to 4:45 = 1 hour (60 min). 4:45 to 5:45 = another 60 (total 120). 5:45 to 6:30 = 45 minutes. Total = 60+60+45 = 165 minutes. So answer 165 minutes.

Q15: Taxi can carry 4 passengers. Group of 22 people. Number of taxis needed = ceil(22/4) = 5.5 => 6 taxis. So answer 6.

Q16: Triangle angles: 31° and 62°, third angle = 180 - (31+62) = 180 - 93 = 87°. So answer 87°.

Now produce answer list.

We should format maybe as Q1: answer, etc.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Answers**
