### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Step 1: Identify notable mathematical properties of 120.**

- **Factorial:** 5! = 120 (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
- **Highly composite number:** 120 has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors).
- **Triangular number:** 120 is the 15th triangular number (since T₁₅ = 15×16/2 = 120).
- **Decagonal number:** 120 is also a decagonal number.
- **Relatively prime to many numbers:** 120 is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 5 (except 4, which shares factors).
- **Divisibility:** It is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and itself.
- **Practical number:** Every number less than 120 can be written as the sum of distinct divisors of 120.
- **In mathematics:** 120 appears in combinatorics (number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects with some symmetries), in geometry (as the number of edges in a dodecahedron), and in number theory as a product of small primes (2³ × 3 × 5).

**Step 2: Summarize significance.**

120 is significant because it is a highly composite, factorial, and triangular number, making it useful in many areas of mathematics for counting, combinations, and as a building block in number theory.

**Answer:**
I am not sure, but I think the answer is that the number 120 is significant because it is the factorial of 5 (5!), a highly composite number with 16 divisors, the 15th triangular number, and appears frequently in combinatorics and number theory due to its rich factorization (2³ × 3 × 5). These properties make it especially useful in various mathematical contexts.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation form.**

The equation is in the standard quadratic form: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -7, c = -18.

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Plug in the values.**

- b = -7, so -b = 7
- a = 1, b = -7, c = -18
- Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-7)² - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121

**Step 4: Compute the roots.**

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \times 1}
\]
\[
\sqrt{121} = 11
\]
So,
\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
\[
x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
\]

**Answer:**
The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. Assume negligible time in the cities. How many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day (24 hours)?

**Step 1: Calculate one one-way trip time.**

Distance one way = 200 km  
Speed = 60 km/h  
Time one way = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours

**Step 2: Calculate time for a round trip.**

Round trip = 2 × (time one way) = 2 × (10/3) = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.6667 hours

**Step 3: Find total number of round trips in 24 hours.**

Total available time = 24 hours  
Time per round trip = 20/3 hours

Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip  
= 24 / (20/3)  
= 24 × (3/20)  
= (24 × 3) / 20  
= 72 / 20  
= 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip (assuming we want whole trips), it can complete 3 full round trips in 24 hours.

**Alternative interpretation (if partial trips allowed):**
If partial trips are allowed (e.g., as a rate), the answer could be 3.6 round trips per day. But typically, the answer expects whole trips.

**Answer:**
I am not sure, but I think the answer is either 3 full round trips (if only whole trips count) or 3.6 round trips per day (if fractional trips are allowed). To be precise, the calculation gives 3.6 round trips, but practically, the train can complete 3 full round trips in a day.
