Let's solve each of the three questions step by step, based on the given physical constraints of the elevator.

---

### **Given:**

- Building has **40 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters tall**.
- So, total height from ground to top floor =  
  $ 40 \times 5 = 200 $ meters.
- Elevator **acceleration/deceleration** = $ 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Maximum speed = $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $

We assume:
- The elevator accelerates from rest to maximum speed, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates to rest at the destination.
- For stops in between, the elevator must accelerate to max speed, travel at constant speed, then decelerate to stop at the next floor.
- We assume **no time is lost** in changing direction or stopping (i.e., stops are instantaneous).
- Acceleration and deceleration are symmetric (same magnitude).

---

## **Step 1: Time to go from ground floor (1/F) to 40/F (200 meters)**

We need to compute the total time for the elevator to go from 0 m to 200 m.

### Step 1.1: Acceleration phase

- Acceleration $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Final speed $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $
- Time to reach max speed:  
  $ t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{seconds} $

- Distance covered during acceleration:  
  $ d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{meters} $

### Step 1.2: Deceleration phase

- Same as acceleration:  
  $ t_{\text{dec}} = 5 \, \text{seconds} $  
  $ d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{meters} $

### Step 1.3: Constant speed phase

- Total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration:  
  $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{meters} $

- Remaining distance at constant speed:  
  $ 200 - 25 = 175 \, \text{meters} $

- Time at constant speed:  
  $ t_{\text{const}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds} $

### Step 1.4: Total time

$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{acc}} + t_{\text{const}} + t_{\text{dec}} = 5 + 35 + 5 = \boxed{45} \text{seconds}
$$

### ✅ Answer to Question 1:  
**It takes 45 seconds** for a person to go from ground floor to top floor.

---

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F, second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Now, the lift must serve **two destinations**: 10/F and 30/F.

We assume:
- The lift starts at ground floor (0 m).
- It must go to 10/F (50 m), then to 30/F (150 m), or vice versa?
- But since both people get on at ground floor, and the lift must serve both, it will go to one destination, then the other.

But **which order?**  
We must consider the **optimal path** to minimize total time.

### Option 1: Go to 10/F first, then to 30/F

- From 0 m → 50 m (10/F)
- Then from 50 m → 150 m (30/F)

But the lift must **accelerate to max speed**, then travel at constant speed, then **decelerate** at each stop.

So we need to compute time for:
1. Accelerate to 5 m/s → stop at 10/F (50 m)
2. Then accelerate again to 5 m/s → go to 30/F (150 m)

But wait — after stopping at 10/F, the lift must **accelerate again** to reach 30/F.

So we need to compute time for each leg.

---

### Leg 1: 0 m → 50 m (10/F)

- Acceleration phase:  
  $ t_{\text{acc}} = 5 \, \text{s} $, $ d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- Deceleration phase:  
  $ t_{\text{dec}} = 5 \, \text{s} $, $ d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- Distance covered during acc and dec: 25 m
- Remaining distance: $ 50 - 25 = 25 \, \text{m} $
- Time at constant speed: $ 25 / 5 = 5 \, \text{s} $
- Total time for this leg: $ 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \, \text{s} $

✅ So time to reach 10/F: **15 seconds**

---

### Leg 2: 50 m → 150 m (30/F)

Distance = $ 150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{m} $

Now, the lift starts from 50 m (already at rest after stopping at 10/F), so it must:
- Accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s
- Travel at constant speed
- Decelerate to stop at 150 m

So again:
- $ d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- $ d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $
- Total acc/dec distance: 25 m
- Remaining distance: $ 100 - 25 = 75 \, \text{m} $
- Time at constant speed: $ 75 / 5 = 15 \, \text{s} $
- Total time for this leg: $ 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s} $

✅ So time from 10/F to 30/F: **25 seconds**

---

### Total time for both trips:  
$ 15 + 25 = \boxed{40} \text{seconds} $

---

### Option 2: Go to 30/F first, then to 10/F?

- 0 → 150 m (30/F):  
  Distance = 150 m  
  Acc: 12.5 m, 5 s  
  Dec: 12.5 m, 5 s  
  Constant speed: $ 150 - 25 = 125 $ m → $ 125 / 5 = 25 $ s  
  Total time: $ 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 $ s

- Then from 150 m → 50 m (10/F):  
  Distance = 100 m  
  Acc: 5 s, 12.5 m  
  Dec: 5 s, 12.5 m  
  Constant speed: $ 100 - 25 = 75 $ m → $ 75 / 5 = 15 $ s  
  Total time: $ 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 $ s

- Total time: $ 35 + 25 = 60 $ seconds → **worse**

So **Option 1 is better**.

---

### ✅ Answer to Question 2:  
**It takes 40 seconds** for the lift to serve both 10/F and 30/F.

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

We are to find the **minimum time** for the lift to reach 40/F **if it must stop at another floor (not 40/F)**.

So the lift must:
- Start at ground floor (0 m)
- Stop at **some floor between 1/F and 39/F** (say floor $ f $)
- Then go to 40/F (200 m)

We are to **minimize the total time** to reach 40/F, with **one intermediate stop**.

We assume:
- The lift accelerates to max speed, stops at intermediate floor, then accelerates again to go to 40/F.
- The stop at floor $ f $ is **not** at 40/F.

We want to find the **minimum possible time** over all possible intermediate stops.

Let’s define:
- Let $ d $ = distance from ground to intermediate floor $ f $: $ d = 5f $ meters
- Then distance from $ f $ to 40/F: $ 200 - 5f $ meters

We compute total time as:
- Time to go from 0 → $ f $
- Time to go from $ f $ → 40/F

Each leg has:
- Acceleration: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Deceleration: 5 s, 12.5 m
- Constant speed: remaining distance at 5 m/s

So for a leg of distance $ D $:

$$
t(D) = 5 + \frac{D - 25}{5} + 5 = 10 + \frac{D - 25}{5} \quad \text{if } D > 25
$$

If $ D \leq 25 $, then the elevator cannot reach max speed — it would just accelerate and decelerate, and the total time is $ 2t_{\text{acc}} = 10 $ seconds (since $ t_{\text{acc}} = 5 $ s, and deceleration is same).

But in our case, since we are going to 40/F, and stopping at some floor between 1 and 39, the distances are likely large.

So for $ D > 25 $:

$$
t(D) = 10 + \frac{D - 25}{5}
$$

Now, total time $ T(f) $:

$$
T(f) = t(5f) + t(200 - 5f)
$$

Let $ x = 5f $ → distance to intermediate floor (in meters)

Then $ x \in (0, 195] $, since $ f \in [1, 39] $ → $ x \in [5, 195] $

But we must have $ x > 25 $ and $ 200 - x > 25 $, otherwise the constant speed phase is zero or negative.

So:
- $ x > 25 $ → $ f > 5 $
- $ 200 - x > 25 $ → $ x < 175 $ → $ f < 35 $

So for $ f \in (5, 35) $, both legs have constant speed phase.

So for $ x \in (25, 175) $:

$$
T(x) = \left[10 + \frac{x - 25}{5}\right] + \left[10 + \frac{(200 - x) - 25}{5}\right]
$$

Simplify:

$$
T(x) = 20 + \frac{x - 25}{5} + \frac{175 - x}{5}
$$

$$
T(x) = 20 + \frac{(x - 25) + (175 - x)}{5} = 20 + \frac{150}{5} = 20 + 30 = \boxed{50} \text{seconds}
$$

**Interesting!** The total time is **constant** for all $ x \in (25, 175) $

So for any intermediate stop between floor 6 and 34 (inclusive), the total time is **50 seconds**.

Now, what about endpoints?

### Case 1: $ x = 25 $ → $ f = 5 $

- Distance to 5/F: 25 m
- Time to go from 0 → 5/F:  
  Since $ D = 25 $, which is exactly the acc + dec distance,  
  Time = $ 5 + 5 = 10 $ seconds

- Distance from 5/F to 40/F: $ 200 - 25 = 175 $ m  
  $ D = 175 > 25 $  
  Time = $ 10 + \frac{175 - 25}{5} = 10 + \frac{150}{5} = 10 + 30 = 40 $ seconds

- Total time: $ 10 + 40 = \boxed{50} $ seconds

### Case 2: $ x = 175 $ → $ f = 35 $

- Distance to 35/F: 175 m → time = $ 10 + \frac{175 - 25}{5} = 10 + 30 = 40 $ s
- Distance to 40/F: $ 25 $ m → time = 10 s
- Total: $ 40 + 10 = 50 $ s

### Case 3: $ x < 25 $ → e.g., $ f = 4 $

- Distance to 4/F: 20 m  
  Time: $ 10 $ s (since $ 20 < 25 $, only acc and dec)
- Distance to 40/F: $ 180 $ m  
  Time: $ 10 + \frac{180 - 25}{5} = 10 + 31 = 41 $ s  
  Total: $ 10 + 41 = 51 $ s → **worse**

### Case 4: $ x > 175 $ → e.g., $ f = 36 $

- Distance to 36/F: 180 m → time = $ 10 + \frac{180 - 25}{5} = 10 + 31 = 41 $ s
- Distance to 40/F: $ 20 $ m → time = 10 s
- Total: $ 41 + 10 = 51 $ s → **worse**

So **minimum time is 50 seconds**, achieved when:
- Intermediate stop is between floor 5 and 35 (inclusive)
- For any such stop, total time is **50 seconds**

But the question says: **"what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?"**

So we are to **minimize** the time, given that it must stop at **some floor between 1 and 40**, but not at 40.

We just found that **the minimum time is 50 seconds**, and it's **constant** for all intermediate stops in the valid range.

So the **minimum possible time** is **50 seconds**.
