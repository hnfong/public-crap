ASSISTANT: 1. Q1: 1+1=2
2. Q2: 6*7=42
3. Q3: 83*59=4897
4. Q4: 349*683=239,717
5. Q5: 6043*7489=45,284,007
6. Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides and then divide by 3:
   3x = 22 - 7
   3x = 15
   x = 15 / 3
   x = 5
7. Q7: What is 25% of 80? To find 25% of 80, multiply 80 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%):
   25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80
   = 20
8. Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. The total amount given is $45 ($20 + $20 + $5), so the final change the shopkeeper should give me is:
   $45 - $15 = $30
9. Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The perimeter (P) of a square is given by P = 4s, where s is the length of one side:
   P = 4 * 5
   P = 20 units
10. Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine's mother has 4 children (Katherine, her two brothers, and her sister).
11. Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), divide before adding or subtracting:
   3 + (12 รท 4) - 1
   = 3 + 3 - 1
   = 6 - 1
   = 5
12. Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Typically, each guest would get one slice, so 5 slices are needed.
13. Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? To find the sale price, calculate 20% of $25 and subtract it from the original price:
   20% of $25 = 0.20 * $25
   = $5
   Sale price = $25 - $5
   = $20
14. Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? To find the difference, calculate the time until 6:30 PM from 3:45 PM:
   From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours and 15 minutes (135 minutes).
   From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is an additional 30 minutes.
   Total minutes left = 135 + 30
   = 165 minutes
15. Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? To find the number of taxis needed, divide the number of people by the taxi's capacity:
   22 people รท 4 people/taxi = 5.5 taxis
   Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis to accommodate everyone.
16. Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the third angle is:
   180 - (31 + 62)
   = 180 - 93
   = 87 degrees
