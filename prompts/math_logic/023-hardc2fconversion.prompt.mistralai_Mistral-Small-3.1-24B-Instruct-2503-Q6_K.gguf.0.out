"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember the approximate conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. This method works well for temperatures around the range of 0°C to 100°C, where the digits of the Celsius temperature can be inverted to get a rough estimate of the Fahrenheit temperature.

Here's how it works:

1. **For temperatures around 0°C to 100°C**:
   - Take the Celsius temperature.
   - Invert the digits to get an approximate Fahrenheit temperature.

### Examples:

1. **0°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 0 becomes 0.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 32°F (actual is 32°F).

2. **12°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 12 becomes 21.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 70°F (actual is 53.6°F).

3. **24°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 24 becomes 42.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 110°F (actual is 75.2°F).

4. **36°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 36 becomes 63.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 145°F (actual is 96.8°F).

5. **48°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 48 becomes 84.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 185°F (actual is 118.4°F).

6. **60°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 60 becomes 06.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 140°F (actual is 140°F).

7. **72°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 72 becomes 27.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 167°F (actual is 161.6°F).

8. **84°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 84 becomes 48.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 185°F (actual is 183.2°F).

9. **96°C**:
   - Invert the digits: 96 becomes 69.
   - Approximate Fahrenheit: 195°F (actual is 204.8°F).

### Important Notes:
- This method is an approximation and works best within the range of 0°C to 100°C.
- For more precise conversions, use the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \).
- The inverted digits method is a quick and easy way to get a rough estimate, but it may not be accurate for all temperatures.

This mnemonic is useful for quick mental calculations but should be used with the understanding that it provides approximate values. [end of text]
