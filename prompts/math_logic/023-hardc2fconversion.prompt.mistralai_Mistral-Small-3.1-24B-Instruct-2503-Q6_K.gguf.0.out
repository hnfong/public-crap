The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic to help remember the approximate conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This mnemonic works because there is a rough correspondence between certain Celsius temperatures and their Fahrenheit equivalents when the digits are inverted.

Here's how it works:

1. **Identify the Celsius temperature**: Look at the Celsius temperature you want to convert.
2. **Check if it is a multiple of 12**: If the Celsius temperature is a multiple of 12, you can use this mnemonic.
3. **Invert the digits**: Swap the tens and units digits of the Celsius temperature to get the approximate Fahrenheit temperature.

### Examples:

1. **0°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - Celsius: 0°C
   - Inverted: 0°F (Note: This is an exception, as 0°C is actually 32°F, but the mnemonic doesn't apply perfectly here.)

2. **12°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - Celsius: 12°C
   - Inverted: 21°F (Note: This is not accurate; 12°C is actually about 54°F.)

3. **24°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - Celsius: 24°C
   - Inverted: 42°F (Note: This is not accurate; 24°C is actually about 75°F.)

4. **36°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - Celsius: 36°C
   - Inverted: 63°F (Note: This is not accurate; 36°C is actually about 97°F.)

5. **48°C to Fahrenheit**:
   - Celsius: 48°C
   - Inverted: 84°F (Note: This is not accurate; 48°C is actually about 118°F.)

### Important Note:
This mnemonic is a rough approximation and does not provide exact conversions. For precise conversions, you should use the formula:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

Where \( F \) is the Fahrenheit temperature and \( C \) is the Celsius temperature.

### Example of Precise Conversion:
- **24°C to Fahrenheit**:
  - Using the formula: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 \)
  - \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F \)

So, while the mnemonic can be a helpful quick reference, it is not a substitute for the actual conversion formula. [end of text]
