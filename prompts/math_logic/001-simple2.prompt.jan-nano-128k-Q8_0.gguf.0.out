Okay, let's tackle these three questions one by one. I need to make sure I understand each part and provide clear steps for the answers. Let me start with Q1.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

Hmm, 120 is a number that comes up in various contexts. First, I remember that 120 is the factorial of 5, which is 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. That's a key property. Also, 120 is a triangular number. Wait, triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The formula for the nth triangular number is n(n+1)/2. Let me check: if n=15, then 15×16/2 = 120. So 120 is the 15th triangular number. 

Another thing, 120 is a hexagonal number. The formula for hexagonal numbers is n(2n - 1). Let me see if that works for some n. Let's try n=5: 5×(10-1)=5×9=45, not 120. n=6: 6×(12-1)=6×11=66. n=7: 7×13=91. n=8: 8×15=120. Yes, so 120 is the 8th hexagonal number. 

Also, 120 is a pronic number, which is the product of two consecutive integers. Let me check: 10×12=120. So that's another property. 

In terms of significance, 120 is the number of seconds in a minute (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, but wait, that's 60×60=3600 seconds in an hour, not 120). Wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, 120 is the number of minutes in a day? No, that's 24×60=1440. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, 120 is the number of degrees in a circle divided by 360, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, 120 is also the number of combinations of 5 things taken 3 at a time. The formula is C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!). So C(5,3) = 10, but that's not 120. Wait, maybe C(10,5) is 252, which is not 120. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 people in a line, which is 5! = 120. That's correct. 

Also, 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me check the divisors of 120. The prime factors are 2^3 * 3 * 5. The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4×2×2=16. So yes, 120 has 16 divisors, which is more than any number before it. 

Another thing, 120 is the sum of the first 10 numbers: 1+2+3+...+10 = 55, no. Wait, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55. Not 120. Wait, maybe the sum of the first 15 numbers? 15×16/2=120. Yes, that's the triangular number again. 

Also, in terms of geometry, 120 is the number of edges in a regular icosahedron? Wait, no, an icosahedron has 30 edges. Maybe not. Alternatively, 120 is the number of edges in a dodecahedron? No, a dodecahedron has 30 edges. Hmm. Maybe not. 

Wait, 120 is also the number of permutations of 5 elements, which is 5! = 120. That's a key point. Also, in the context of the number of ways to arrange people around a circular table, if there are 5 people, the number of distinct arrangements is (5-1)! = 24, but that's not 120. Wait, maybe if it's a linear arrangement, then 5! = 120. 

Also, 120 is the number of different ways to partition a set of 5 elements into non-empty subsets, but that's the Bell number B5, which is 52. Not 120. 

Alternatively, 120 is the number of different ways to choose 3 elements from 5, but that's C(5,3)=10. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe in terms of the number of possible combinations for something else. For example, in the game of chess, the number of possible moves for a knight on a 8x8 board is 32, but that's not 120. 

Alternatively, 120 is the number of seconds in 2 minutes (120 seconds). But that's not particularly significant. 

Wait, 120 is also the number of degrees in a triangle's angles if it's a 120-degree angle, but that's not a standard fact. 

I think the main points are: 5! = 120, triangular number (15th), hexagonal number (8th), pronic number (10×12), highly composite number, and maybe some other properties like being a Harshad number (divisible by the sum of its digits: 1+2+0=3, 120 ÷ 3 = 40, so yes). Also, 120 is a multiple of many numbers, which is why it's highly composite. 

So, the answer should include these properties: factorial, triangular, hexagonal, pronic, highly composite, Harshad number, etc.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

Alright, solving a quadratic equation. The standard method is using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, the equation is x² -7x -18 = 0, so a=1, b=-7, c=-18.

First, compute the discriminant: D = b² - 4ac = (-7)² - 4*1*(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121. 

Since the discriminant is a perfect square (11²=121), the roots will be rational. Then, x = [7 ± √121]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2.

So, two solutions: (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, and (7 - 11)/2 = -4/2 = -2. 

Therefore, the solutions are x=9 and x=-2. Let me check by plugging back in:

For x=9: 9² -7*9 -18 = 81 -63 -18 = 0. Correct.

For x=-2: (-2)² -7*(-2) -18 = 4 +14 -18 = 0. Correct.

So the answer is x=9 and x=-2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

First, need to figure out how long it takes for one round trip. A round trip is going from city A to city B and back to city A. The distance between the cities is 200 km, so one way is 200 km, round trip is 400 km.

The average speed is 60 km/h. So time for one round trip is total distance divided by speed: 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.666... hours, which is 6 hours and 40 minutes (since 0.666... hours is 40 minutes).

Now, a full day is 24 hours. So how many round trips can the train make in 24 hours?

Divide 24 hours by the time per round trip: 24 / 6.666... = 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6. 

But since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to take the integer part. So 3 full round trips. But wait, maybe the question allows for partial trips? Wait, the problem says "how many round trips can it make within a full day", so if the time is 3.6, that would mean 3 full round trips and then 0.6 of another trip. But since the train can't start a trip if it's not completed, the answer is 3. 

But wait, let me check again. Wait, the time for one round trip is 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.666... hours. So 24 hours divided by that is 3.6. So the train can make 3 full round trips, and then 0.6 of a trip would take 0.6*6.666... hours? Wait, no. Wait, the time for one round trip is 6.666... hours. So 3 round trips would take 3*6.666... = 20 hours. Then, the remaining time is 24 - 20 = 4 hours. In 4 hours, the train can travel 60 km/h * 4 h = 240 km. But since the round trip is 400 km, the train can't complete another round trip in 4 hours. Therefore, the answer is 3 round trips.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the train can make a trip in one direction and then another, but the problem says "round trips", so each round trip is a complete cycle. Therefore, the answer is 3.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify:

Total distance for round trip: 200*2 = 400 km.

Time per round trip: 400 / 60 = 6.666... hours = 6 hours 40 minutes.

In 24 hours, how many times can this happen?

24 divided by 6.666... is 3.6. So 3 full round trips, and 0.6 of a trip. Since 0.6 of a trip would be 0.6*400 km = 240 km. But the train can't do a partial trip. So the answer is 3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the train can make a trip in one direction and then another, but the question says "round trips", so each round trip is two one-way trips. Therefore, the answer is 3.

But wait, another way: maybe the time for one way is 200/60 = 3.333... hours (20 minutes). So a round trip is 6.666... hours. So 24 / 6.666... = 3.6. So again, 3 full round trips.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to consider that the train can make a trip in one direction, then another, but the question says "round trips", so each round trip is a complete cycle. Therefore, the answer is 3.

But wait, maybe the problem is in the way the time is calculated. Let me check again:

If the train goes from A to B: 200 km at 60 km/h takes 200/60 = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours.

Then, from B to A: same time, 10/3 hours. So total round trip time is 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours.

In 24 hours, how many times does 20/3 fit into 24?

24 divided by 20/3 is 24 * 3 / 20 = 72/20 = 3.6. So 3 full round trips, and 0.6 of a round trip. Since 0.6 is less than 1, the answer is 3.

But maybe the problem is considering that the train can start a new trip immediately after finishing the previous one. So if the train starts at 0 hours, goes to B in 10/3 hours, then back to A in another 10/3 hours, that's 20/3 hours for the first round trip. Then, the next round trip would start at 20/3 hours, and so on. So in 24 hours, how many times can this happen?

Let me compute 24 / (20/3) = 3.6. So 3 full round trips, and then 0.6 of a round trip. But since the train can't do a partial trip, the answer is 3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to consider that the train can make 3 round trips and then a partial trip, but the question says "how many round trips can it make", so only full ones count. Therefore, 3.

But wait, maybe I should check if the time is 24 hours exactly. Let me think: 3 round trips take 3*(20/3) = 20 hours. Then, the remaining time is 4 hours. In 4 hours, the train can go from A to B in 10/3 hours (≈3.333 hours) and then from B to A in another 10/3 hours, but that would take 6.666 hours, which is more than 4 hours. So in 4 hours, the train can only go from A to B once, but not complete the round trip. Therefore, the answer is 3.

So the answer is 3 round trips.

But wait, maybe the problem is considering that the train can make a trip in one direction and then another, but the question says "round trips", so each round trip is two one-way trips. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the time is calculated. Let me check again:

Total time for one round trip: 200*2 / 60 = 400/60 = 6.666... hours.

Number of round trips in 24 hours: 24 / 6.666... = 3.6. So 3 full round trips.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 3.

But wait, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of "within a full day". If the train starts at the beginning of the day, then after 3 round trips, it would have used 20 hours. Then, in the remaining 4 hours, it can make a partial trip, but since a round trip requires going back, it can't complete another round trip. Therefore, 3 is the answer.

So, the answer is 3.
