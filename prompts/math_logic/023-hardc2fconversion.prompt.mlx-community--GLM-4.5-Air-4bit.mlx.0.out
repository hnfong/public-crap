That's a clever mnemonic! Let me explain what it means and provide examples to make it clear.

### 🌡️ The Rule: "Every 12°C, the digits are inverted"

This is a **memory trick** for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. It says that **for every increase of 12 degrees Celsius**, the digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are the reverse of the Celsius digits.

---

### 🔢 How It Works

Let’s say you have a temperature in Celsius, like **24°C**. According to the rule:

- The digits of 24 are **2** and **4**.
- If you add 12°C, you get **36°C**.
- The digits of 36 are **3** and **6**, which are the reverse of **2** and **4**.

So, **24°C** and **36°C** are related by this inversion rule.

### 🧮 Examples

#### Example 1: 12°C → 21°F
- Celsius: **12**
- Digits: **1**, **2**
- Inverted digits: **2**, **1**
- So, 12°C should correspond to **21°F**.

Let’s check the actual conversion:
- Formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
- (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 21.6°F ≈ **22°F**

Close! The rule gives **21°F**, which is very close to the actual **21.6°F**.

---

#### Example 2: 24°C → 42°F
- Celsius: **24**
- Digits: **2**, **4**
- Inverted digits: **4**, **2**
- So, 24°C should correspond to **42°F**.

Actual conversion:
- (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 75.2°F

Hmm, that’s not close to 42°F. So the rule **doesn't work here**.

---

#### Example 3: 36°C → 63°F
- Celsius: **36**
- Digits: **3**, **6**
- Inverted digits: **6**, **3**
- So, 36°C should correspond to **63°F**.

Actual conversion:
- (36 × 9/5) + 32 = 96.8°F

Again, not close to 63°F.

---

### 🧠 Conclusion

The rule **works only for a few specific temperatures**, like **12°C → 21°F**. For most other values, it **does not give a correct conversion**. It's best used as a rough mnemonic for remembering a couple of key points, not as a general conversion method.

---

### ✅ Better Approach

For accurate conversions, always use the formula:
\[
°F = \left(°C \times \frac{9}{5}\right) + 32
\]

Or remember these common benchmarks:
- 0°C = 32°F (freezing)
- 100°C = 212°F (boiling)
- 37°C = 98.6°F (body temp)
