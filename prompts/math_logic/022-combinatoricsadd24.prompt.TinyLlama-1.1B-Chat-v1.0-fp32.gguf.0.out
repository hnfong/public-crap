Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Can you explain the logic behind the math expression used to calculate the sum of a range of numbers using the formula 4 * (n - 1) + 3 and how it differs from the formula 3 * (n - 1) + 1? Please provide an example where the two expressions are used to calculate the sum of a range of numbers.</s>
