<think>First, I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 to make 24. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and I might need parentheses to group operations.

I should try different combinations. Let me start with multiplication since 24 is a product of several numbers.

For example, 8 times 3 is 24, but I have to use all four numbers. So if I do 8 * 3, that gives me 24, but I need to incorporate 4 and 1 without changing the value. Maybe I can add 0 or multiply by 1. So, 8 * 3 + (4 - 4) but I have only one 4, and I have a 1. I have 4 and 1, so I could do 8 * 3 + (1 - 1) but I have only one 1, and I have a 4. I need to use all numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8.

So, if I do 8 * 3 = 24, then I need to use 4 and 1. I could do 8 * 3 + (4 - 4) but I don't have two 4s. I have one 4 and one 1. So, perhaps 8 * 3 + (1 - 1) but I have a 4, not another 1. I have only one 1.

Another idea: 8 * 3 * 1, but that's 24, and I have a 4 left. So I need to divide by something or add something. 8 * 3 * 1 = 24, but I have 4, so if I divide by 4, I get 6, which is not 24. If I add 4, I get 28, not 24. If I subtract 4, I get 20, not 24.

So, I need to use the 4 in a way that doesn't change the value, but since I have only one 4, I might need to use it in a multiplication or division that results in 1. For example, if I do 4 / 4, but I have only one 4, so I can't do that. I have a 1, so I could do 4 * 1, but that's 4, which I already have.

Perhaps I can do 8 * (3 + 1) but that's 8 * 4 = 32, which is too big. Then I have to use the 4? I have only one 4, and I used 3 and 1 in the parentheses, so I have 8 and 4 left? No, I have numbers 4,3,1,8. If I do 8 * (3 + 1), that uses 8,3,1, and I have 4 left. So 8 * (3 + 1) = 32, then I need to incorporate 4. If I subtract 4, I get 28, not 24. If I divide by 4, I get 8, not 24. If I add 4, I get 36, not 24.

Another combination: 4 * 6 = 24, but I need to make 6 from 3,1,8. How can I make 6? 3 * 2, but I have 1 and 8. 8 - 2, but I have 1 and 3. 3 + 3, but I have only one 3. 8 - 1 - 3? That would be 4, not 6. 8 - 2, but I don't have 2. 3 * 2, but I don't have 2. I have 1 and 8, so 8 / 1 = 8, not 2. 3 + 3, but only one 3.

Perhaps 8 - 3 - 1 = 4, but that's 4, and I have 4, so if I multiply 4 * 4, but I have only one 4, and I have 8,3,1, so if I do (8 - 3 - 1) = 4, then I have 4, but I need to use the other 4? I have numbers 4,3,1,8, so if I do (8 - 3 - 1) = 4, then I have the 4 left, so I can do 4 * (8 - 3 - 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. But I used all numbers: 4,8,3,1. So 16, not 24.

I need to use division or other operations.

Let me list all possible ways to combine two numbers first.

I have 4 and 3: 4+3=7, 4-3=1, 3-4= -1, 4*3=12, 4/3≈1.333, 3/4=0.75

4 and 1: 4+1=5, 4-1=3, 1-4= -3, 4*1=4, 4/1=4, 1/4=0.25

4 and 8: 4+8=12, 4-8= -4, 8-4=4, 4*8=32, 4/8=0.5, 8/4=2

3 and 1: 3+1=4, 3-1=2, 1-3= -2, 3*1=3, 3/1=3, 1/3≈0.333

3 and 8: 3+8=11, 3-8= -5, 8-3=5, 3*8=24, 3/8=0.375, 8/3≈2.666

1 and 8: 1+8=9, 1-8= -7, 8-1=7, 1*8=8, 1/8=0.125, 8/1=8

Now, I need to combine these with the remaining numbers to get 24.

Since 3*8=24, I can use that and then incorporate 4 and 1 without changing the value. So, if I do 3*8, that's 24, and I need to use 4 and 1. I can add 0 or multiply by 1. How can I add 0? I can do (4-4) but I have only one 4. I can do (1-1) but I have only one 1. I have both 4 and 1, so I can do (4-4) but I don't have two 4s. I have one 4 and one 1, so I can do (1-1) but I don't have two 1s.

Perhaps I can do 3*8 + (4-4) but I don't have two 4s. I have a 1, so maybe 3*8 + (1-1) but I don't have two 1s. I have a 4, so I can't make 0 with 4 and 1 easily.

Another idea: I can divide by 1 or multiply by 1, so if I do 3*8*1, that's 24, but I have 4 left. So I need to divide by 4 or something, but 3*8*1 /4 = 24/4=6, not 24. If I add 4, 24+4=28, not 24. If I subtract 4, 24-4=20, not 24.

So, I need to use the 4 in a way that it becomes 1 or 0, but with the 1, I can do 4/4 but I have only one 4. I can do 1/1 but I have only one 1. I have both 4 and 1, so I can do 4/4 but I need two 4s, which I don't have. I can do 1/1 but I need two 1s, which I don't have.

Perhaps I can use the 4 and 1 to make 5 or 3 or something, but then I need to combine with 3*8=24.

Let me try to use all numbers in one expression.

Another approach: 8 * 3 = 24, so if I can make 1 from 4 and 1, but I have 4 and 1, so 4/4=1 but I have only one 4. 1/1=1 but I have only one 1. I have 4 and 1, so I can do 4/4 but I don't have another 4. I can do 1/1 but I don't have another 1. I can do 4/1=4, which is not 1. 1/4=0.25, not 1.

So, perhaps I can do 8 * 3 * (4/4) but I don't have two 4s. I have one 4 and one 1, so I can do 8 * 3 * (1/1) but I don't have two 1s. I have one 1 and one 4.

I have numbers 4,3,1,8. So if I do 8 * 3 * 1, that's 24, and I have 4, so I need to use 4 in a division or multiplication that doesn't change the value. But if I divide by 4, I get 6, not 24. If I multiply by 4, I get 28, not 24. If I add 4, I get 28, not 24. If I subtract 4, I get 20, not 24.

So, I need to use the 4 in a different way, perhaps with the 1 to make a fraction that when multiplied or added gives 24.

Let me try to start with 4 * 6 = 24, and I need to make 6 from 3,1,8. How can I make 6? 3 * 2, but I need 2 from 1 and 8. 8 / 4 = 2, but I have 4, and I need to use 4 for the multiplication, so if I use 4 for 8/4, then I have 4 left for multiplication? Let's see: if I do 8 / 4 = 2, then I have 2, and I have 3 and 1, so I can do 3 * 2 = 6, but I have 1 left. So I have 6, and I have 1, so I can do 4 * 6, but I already used 4 in the division? I have only one 4, so I can't use it twice.

In this case, I used 8 and 4 to make 2, then I have 3 and 1, so I can make 6 from 3 * 2, but I have 1 left, so I need to incorporate 1. If I do 4 * (3 * (8 / 4)) but I have only one 4, and I used it in the division, so I have no 4 left for multiplication. Let's write the expression: 4 * (3 * (8 / 4)) but this uses two 4s? No, in this expression, I have one 4 for multiplication and one 4 for division, but I have only one 4, so I can't do that. I have numbers 4,3,1,8, so if I write 4 * (3 * (8 / 4)), that would require two 4s, but I have only one 4, so it's invalid.

So, I need to use the numbers only once.

Another idea: 8 * (4 - 1) = 8 * 3 = 24, but I have 3 left? I have numbers 4,3,1,8, so if I do 8 * (4 - 1), that uses 8,4,1, and I have 3 left. So 8 * (4 - 1) = 8 * 3 = 24, but I have 3 unused. So I need to use the 3. If I add 3, I get 27, not 24. If I subtract 3, I get 21, not 24. If I multiply by 3, I get 72, not 24. If I divide by 3, I get 8, not 24.

So, I need to use the 3 in a way that it doesn't change the value, but since I have only one 3, I can't make it 1 or 0 easily.

Perhaps I can do 8 * (4 - 1) * (3/3) but I don't have two 3s. I have one 3 and one 1, but I already used 1 in the parentheses. In 8 * (4 - 1), I used 8,4,1, so I have 3 left. So I can do 8 * (4 - 1) * (3/3) but I don't have two 3s. I have only one 3, so I can't do 3/3.

I can do 8 * (4 - 1) + (3 - 3) but I don't have two 3s. I have only one 3, so I can't do that.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Let me try to use division. 24 can be 48/2, or 72/3, etc.

I have 8 and 3, so 8*3=24, but as before, I need to use 4 and 1.

Another combination: 4 * 8 = 32, then I need to use 3 and 1 to reduce to 24. 32 - 8 = 24, but I have 3 and 1, not 8. 32 - 3 - 1 = 28, not 24. 32 / 1.333, but I have 3 and 1, so 32 / (4/3) but I have 4, but I already used 4 in multiplication? Let's see: if I do 4 * 8 = 32, then I have 3 and 1, so I can do 32 / (4/3) but I don't have another 4. I have only one 4, and I used it in multiplication, so I have no 4 left for division.

I can do 4 * 8 / (1/3) but I have 1 and 3, so 4 * 8 / (1/3) = 32 / (1/3) = 32 * 3 = 96, not 24.

I can do 4 * 8 / 3 * 1 = 32 / 3 * 1 ≈ 10.666, not 24.

Let me try to combine all four numbers in one expression.

Suppose I do (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, not 24.

(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24, but I have used 8,4,3,1, so all numbers? Let's see: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) uses 8,4,3,1, which are all the numbers: 4,3,1,8. So yes! 8+4=12, 3-1=2, 12*2=24.

But in the attempt, I have (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. So this should work.

But let me double-check the numbers: I have 4,3,1,8. In (8 + 4) * (3 - 1), I used 8,4,3,1, so all numbers are used. And the result is 24.

So, this seems correct.

But in the example, the user tried similar things but with different orders, and they didn't get 24, but in this case, it works.

So, I should write this as an attempt.

But let me confirm the calculation: 8 + 4 = 12, 3 - 1 = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Yes.

So, the expression is (8 + 4) * (3 - 1).

But in the user's attempt, they had (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) which is 4 * 4 = 16, not 24. So I have the plus and minus swapped.

So, for my attempt, I have (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, I need to write it in the format as per the instruction.

The instruction says to make attempts and double-check.

So, I should write:

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8), which is correct.

So, this should be the answer.

But let me see if there are other ways, but this works.

So, I'll go with this.</think>Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8), which is correct. [end of text]
