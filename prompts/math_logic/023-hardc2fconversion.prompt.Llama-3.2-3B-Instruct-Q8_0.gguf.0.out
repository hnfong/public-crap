I think I understand what this means, but I'd like to clarify and provide examples to ensure I'm correct.

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to a mnemonic device to help people remember the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Here's how it works:

* Every 12°C, the digits are inverted, meaning that the tens digit is swapped with the ones digit.
* For example, 12°C becomes 12°F, but 13°C becomes 13°F, 14°C becomes 14°F, and so on.
* However, when the tens digit is 1, it remains the same, and the ones digit is inverted. For instance, 11°C becomes 11°F, 21°C becomes 21°F, 31°C becomes 31°F, and so on.

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

* 12°C becomes 12°F
* 13°C becomes 13°F
* 14°C becomes 14°F
* 15°C becomes 15°F
* 16°C becomes 16°F
* 17°C becomes 17°F
* 18°C becomes 18°F
* 19°C becomes 19°F
* 20°C becomes 20°F
* 21°C becomes 21°F
* 22°C becomes 22°F
* 23°C becomes 23°F
* 24°C becomes 24°F
* 25°C becomes 25°F
* 26°C becomes 26°F
* 27°C becomes 27°F
* 28°C becomes 28°F
* 29°C becomes 29°F
* 30°C becomes 30°F
* 31°C becomes 31°F
* 32°C becomes 32°F
* 33°C becomes 33°F
* 34°C becomes 34°F
* 35°C becomes 35°F
* 36°C becomes 36°F
* 37°C becomes 37°F
* 38°C becomes 38°F
* 39°C becomes 39°F
* 40°C becomes 40°F
* 41°C becomes 41°F
* 42°C becomes 42°F
* 43°C becomes 43°F
* 44°C becomes 44°F
* 45°C becomes 45°F
* 46°C becomes 46°F
* 47°C becomes 47°F
* 48°C becomes 48°F
* 49°C becomes 49°F
* 50°C becomes 50°F
* 51°C becomes 51°F
* 52°C becomes 52°F
* 53°C becomes 53°F
* 54°C becomes 54°F
* 55°C becomes 55°F
* 56°C becomes 56°F
* 57°C becomes 57°F
* 58°C becomes 58°F
* 59°C becomes 59°F

As you can see, the pattern holds true for all the numbers from 12°C to 59°C. However, I noticed that the statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" might not be entirely accurate, as it doesn't apply to all numbers. The correct pattern is that the tens digit remains the same, and the ones digit is inverted only when the tens digit is 1.

If I'm correct, I'd like to start over and provide a revised explanation. [end of text]
