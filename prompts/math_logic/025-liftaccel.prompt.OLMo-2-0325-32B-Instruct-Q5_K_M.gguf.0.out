Let's solve each question step by step.

### Question 1: Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor (40/F)

1. **Calculate the total height:**
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the motion profile:**
   - The lift starts from rest, accelerates to its maximum speed, maintains that speed for some time, then decelerates to stop at the top floor.
   - Maximum speed \(v_{\text{max}} = 5 \text{ m/s}\)
   - Acceleration \(a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2\), deceleration is also \(1 \text{ m/s}^2\).

3. **Calculate time to reach maximum speed:**
   Using the equation \(v = at\), where \(v = 5 \text{ m/s}\) and \(a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2\):
   \[
   t_{\text{accelerate}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Distance covered during acceleration:**
   Using the equation \(d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2\):
   \[
   d_{\text{accelerate}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time at maximum speed:**
   - Total distance to cover at max speed: \(200 \text{ m} - 12.5 \text{ m} = 187.5 \text{ meters}\)
   - Time at max speed: \(t_{\text{constant speed}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{187.5 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 37.5 \text{ seconds}\)

6. **Deceleration time and distance:**
   - Deceleration distance is the same as acceleration distance (12.5 meters) because the deceleration phase mirrors the acceleration phase.
   - Time to decelerate: \(t_{\text{decelerate}} = 5 \text{ seconds}\) (same as acceleration time).

7. **Total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = t_{\text{accelerate}} + t_{\text{constant speed}} + t_{\text{decelerate}} = 5 + 37.5 + 5 = 47.5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   **Answer to Question 1:**
   \[
   \boxed{47.5 \text{ seconds}}
   \]

### Question 2: Time for two people to reach their respective floors (10/F and 30/F)

1. **First leg (ground to 10/F):**
   - Accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters
   - Distance to 10/F: \(10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters}\)
   - Time at max speed: \(\frac{50 - 12.5}{5} = \frac{37.5}{5} = 7.5 \text{ seconds}\)
   - Total time to 10/F: \(5 + 7.5 = 12.5 \text{ seconds}\)

   The lift stops at 10/F for the first person.

2. **Second leg (10/F to 30/F):**
   - Decelerate from max speed: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters
   - Remaining distance: \(30 \times 5 - 50 = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ meters}\)
   - Time at max speed: \(\frac{100 - 12.5}{5} = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \text{ seconds}\)
   - Total time from 10/F to 30/F: \(5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \text{ seconds}\)

   Total time from ground to 30/F for the second person:
   \[
   12.5 \text{ seconds (to 10/F)} + 22.5 \text{ seconds (from 10/F to 30/F)} = 35 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   **Answer to Question 2:**
   \[
   \boxed{35 \text{ seconds}}
   \]

### Question 3: Minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop

1. **First leg (ground to the stop floor):**
   - Let's assume the stop floor is \(x\).
   - Accelerate to max speed: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters
   - Distance to \(x\): \(x \times 5\) meters
   - Time at max speed: \(\frac{x \times 5 - 12.5}{5}\) seconds

   Total time to \(x\):
   \[
   t_{\text{to } x} = 5 + \frac{x \times 5 - 12.5}{5}
   \]

2. **Stop at \(x\), then proceed to 40/F:**
   - Decelerate: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters
   - Remaining distance to 40/F: \(200 - (x \times 5 - 12.5)\) meters
   - Time at max speed: \(\frac{200 - (x \times 5 - 12.5) - 12.5}{5}\) seconds
   - Accelerate to stop at 40/F: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters

   **Minimizing total time:**
   To minimize the total time, the stop floor \(x\) should be as close to 40 as possible without being 40 itself. The minimum stop floor that is not 40/F is 39/F.

   **For \(x = 39\):**
   - Distance to 39/F: \(39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}\)
   - Time to 39/F: \(5 + \frac{195 - 12.5}{5} = 5 + 36.5 = 41.5 \text{ seconds}\)
   - Decelerate: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters
   - Remaining distance to 40/F: \(5 \text{ meters}\) (since 195 + 12.5 = 207.5, but we only need 5 more to reach 200)
   - Time at max speed to cover 5 meters: \(\frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ second}\)
   - Accelerate to stop: 5 seconds, but effectively covers 12.5 meters which is more than needed, so practically, it's just stopping, negligible additional time beyond reaching speed

   Total time:
   \[
   41.5 \text{ seconds (to 39/F)} + 5 \text{ seconds (decelerate)} + 1 \text{ second (to 40/F)} \approx 47.5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   However, due to the nature of the problem and practical stopping considerations, the additional acceleration to stop at 40/F is effectively instantaneous in this context, so the time remains close to the direct travel time with minimal additional overhead.

   **Answer to Question 3:**
   \[
   \boxed{47.5 \text{ seconds}}
   \]
