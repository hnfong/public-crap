Alright, I need to answer these 16 questions. Let's see, starting with the first one: 1+1=?

Hmm, that seems straightforward. 1 plus 1 is... wait, is it 2? Yeah, that makes sense. But let me double-check. If I have one apple and I get another apple, I have two apples. So, 1+1=2. Okay, that seems correct.

Next question: 6*7=?

Okay, 6 times 7. Let me think... 6 times 5 is 30, and 6 times 2 is 12, so 30 plus 12 is 42. So, 6*7=42. That seems right.

Now, 83*59=?

This one is a bit bigger. Let me break it down. 80*60 is 4800, but I need to adjust for the actual numbers. 83 is 3 more than 80, and 59 is 11 less than 60. So, 83*59 would be 80*60 minus 80*11 plus 3*60 minus 3*11. Calculating that: 80*60=4800, 80*11=880, 3*60=180, and 3*11=33. So, 4800 - 880 + 180 - 33 = 3800 + 180 - 33 = 4000 - 33 = 3967. So, 83*59=3967. That seems accurate.

Moving on to 349*683=?

This is getting more complicated. Let's see, 300*600=180,000, 300*83=24,900, 49*600=29,400, and 49*83=4,067. Adding those up: 180,000 + 24,900 = 204,900, plus 29,400 is 234,300, plus 4,067 is 238,367. So, 349*683=238,367. That seems correct.

Next, 6043*7489=?

This is a huge multiplication. Let's see, 6000*7000=42,000,000, 6000*489=2,934,000, 43*7000=301,100, and 43*489=20,927. Adding those up: 42,000,000 + 2,934,000 = 44,934,000, plus 301,100 is 45,235,100, plus 20,927 is 45,256,027. So, 6043*7489=45,256,027. That seems accurate.

Now, solving the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

Let me solve for x. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then, divide both sides by 3: x = 5. So, the solution is x=5. That seems straightforward.

Next question: What is 25% of 80?

25% is a quarter, so a quarter of 80 is 20. So, 25% of 80=20. That makes sense.

Now, I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?

Okay, I pay with two 20s and a 5, so that's 40 + 5 = $45. The book costs $15, so the change should be 45 - 15 = $30. So, the shopkeeper should give me $30 in change. That seems correct.

Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.

A square has four sides, all equal. So, perimeter = 4*side. 4*5=20. So, the perimeter is 20 units. That seems right.

Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?

Katherine has two brothers and a sister, which makes three children. Including herself, that's four children. So, her mother has four children. That seems accurate.

Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1.

First, division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then, 3 + 3 = 6. Finally, 6 - 1 = 5. So, the expression equals 5. That seems correct.

Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?

Assuming each person gets one slice, and there are 5 people, they need 5 slices of cake. That seems straightforward.

If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?

20% of 25 is 5, so the sale price is 25 - 5 = $20. That seems accurate.

If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?

From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. Converting hours to minutes: 2*60=120 minutes, plus 45 minutes equals 165 minutes. So, there are 165 minutes left until 6:30 PM. That seems correct.

A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?

22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up to the next whole number. So, 6 taxis are needed. That seems accurate.

If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?

The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. The third angle is 87 degrees. That seems correct.
