Alright, I need to answer these 16 questions. Let's see, starting with the first one: 1+1=?

Hmm, that's pretty straightforward. 1 plus 1 is... 2. Yeah, that seems right. Moving on to the next one: 6*7=?

Okay, 6 times 7. Let me think... 6 times 5 is 30, and 6 times 2 is 12, so adding those together gives me 42. So, 6*7 equals 42.

Now, 83*59=?

This one is a bit bigger. Let's see, 80 times 60 is 4800, but I need to adjust for the actual numbers. 83 minus 80 is 3, and 59 minus 60 is negative 1. So, 3 times negative 1 is negative 3. Adding that to 4800 gives me 4797. So, 83*59 equals 4797.

Next up: 349*683=?

This is getting more complicated. Let's break it down. 300 times 600 is 180,000. 300 times 80 is 24,000. 300 times 3 is 900. Then, 49 times 600 is 29,400. 49 times 80 is 3,920. 49 times 3 is 147. Adding all these together: 180,000 + 24,000 = 204,000. 204,000 + 900 = 204,900. 204,900 + 29,400 = 234,300. 234,300 + 3,920 = 238,220. 238,220 + 147 = 238,367. So, 349*683 equals 238,367.

Now, solving the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

Let's solve for x. First, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then, divide both sides by 3: x = 5. So, the solution is x equals 5.

Next question: What is 25% of 80?

25% is a quarter, so a quarter of 80 is 20. So, 25% of 80 is 20.

Moving on: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?

Okay, I paid with two 20s and an additional five, so that's 40 + 5 = $45. The book costs $15, so the change should be 45 - 15 = $30. So, the shopkeeper should give me $30 in change.

Now, finding the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.

A square has four sides, all equal. So, perimeter is 4 times the side length. 4 times 5 is 20. So, the perimeter is 20 units.

Next: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?

Katherine has two brothers and a sister, which makes three children. Including herself, that's four children. So, her mother has four children.

Now, evaluating the expression: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1.

First, division: 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then, 3 plus 3 is 6. 6 minus 1 is 5. So, the expression equals 5.

Next: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?

Assuming each person gets one slice, and Tom is also having a slice, that's 6 people. So, they need 6 slices of cake.

Now, if a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?

20% of 25 is 5. So, subtracting that from the original price: 25 - 5 = $20. The sale price is $20.

Next: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?

From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. Converting hours to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes. Adding the 45 minutes gives 165 minutes. So, there are 165 minutes left until 6:30 PM.

Finally: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?

Dividing 22 by 4 gives 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, 6 taxis are needed for 22 people.

Lastly: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?

The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, subtracting the given angles: 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. The third angle measures 87 degrees.
