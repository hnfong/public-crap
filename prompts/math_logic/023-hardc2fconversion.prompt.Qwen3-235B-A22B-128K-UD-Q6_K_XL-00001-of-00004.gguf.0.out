The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** refers to a curious numerical coincidence between some Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures — not a general rule for converting between the two scales.

### What does "digits are inverted" mean?

It means that the digits of the Celsius temperature, when reversed, give you the Fahrenheit temperature.

Let’s look at some examples to clarify:

---

### Example 1:  
**Celsius:** 12°C  
**Fahrenheit:** 54°F  
Digits of 12 reversed: **21**, which is **not** 54 — so this doesn't work.

Wait — maybe the statement is misunderstood. Let’s test the actual conversions:

- 0°C = 32°F → 0 vs 32 → no inversion
- 12°C = 53.6°F ≈ 54°F → 12 vs 54 → not inverted
- 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F → 16 vs 61 → **close!**
- 21°C = 69.8°F ≈ 70°F → 21 vs 70 → not inverted
- 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F → **28 reversed is 82**  
✅ This one works!

So at **28°C ≈ 82°F**, the digits are reversed.

---

### Example 2:
**Celsius:** 16°C  
**Fahrenheit:** ~61°F  
Digits of 16 reversed: **61**  
✅ This also works!

So 16°C ≈ 61°F — again, the digits are reversed.

---

### Example 3:
**Celsius:** 41°C  
**Fahrenheit:** ~105.8°F → not 14°F obviously — doesn’t work.

So the pattern **only works for a few specific temperatures**, not every 12°C.

---

### Let’s test the idea of "every 12°C"

If we start at 16°C and add 12°C:

- 16°C → 61°F ✅ (digits reversed)
- 28°C → 82°F ✅ (digits reversed)
- 40°C → 104°F ❌ (40 reversed is 04 or 4, not 104)
- 52°C → 125.6°F → not 25 or 25°F ❌

So the pattern **only works for a couple of values**, like 16°C and 28°C.

---

### Summary:

The phrase is **not a reliable method** for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. It refers to a **numerical coincidence** that occurs at a few specific temperatures:

- **16°C ≈ 61°F**
- **28°C ≈ 82°F**

These are the main examples where reversing the digits of the Celsius temperature gives you the Fahrenheit temperature (approximately).

It **does not work** consistently every 12°C, and should **not** be used as a general conversion method.

### Correct Way to Convert:

If you're looking for a better way to convert:

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit:**  
  $$
  F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32
  $$

- **Fahrenheit to Celsius:**  
  $$
  C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
  $$

Or a quick approximation:

- Double the Celsius value, subtract 10%, then add 32.
