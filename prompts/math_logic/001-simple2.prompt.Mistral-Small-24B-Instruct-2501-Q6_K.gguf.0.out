Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

  Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5!), which means 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
2. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
3. **Abundant Number**: 120 is an abundant number, meaning the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself. The sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 230, which is greater than 120.
4. **Pentagonal Number**: 120 is the 7th pentagonal number.
5. **Significance in Time**: There are 120 minutes in 2 hours, and 120 seconds in 2 minutes.
6. **Significance in Music**: In music, 120 beats per minute is a common tempo marking known as "Allegro moderato."

Q2: To solve the equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \):

1. **Factor the quadratic equation**:
   \[
   x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
   \]

2. **Set each factor equal to zero**:
   \[
   x - 9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities that are 200 km apart, traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h:

1. **Calculate the time for one trip**:
   \[
   \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{200}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip**:
   \[
   \text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours)**:
   \[
   \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day. [end of text]
