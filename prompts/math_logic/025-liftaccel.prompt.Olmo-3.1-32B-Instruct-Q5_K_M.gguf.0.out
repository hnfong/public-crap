Let's break down each question step by step.

### **Given Data**

- **Number of floors:** 40  
- **Height per floor:** 5 meters  
- **Total height from 1/F to 40/F:**  
  \[
  (40 - 1) \times 5 = 39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
  \]
  (But if we consider from ground (0/F) to 40/F, it's 40 × 5 = 200 meters. Let's clarify:  
  Usually, ground floor is 0, and 1/F is the first above ground. But the problem says "ground floor (1/F)", so let's assume 1/F is ground, 2/F is first above, ..., 40/F is top.  
  So, from 1/F to 40/F is (40 - 1) = 39 floors up, so 39 × 5 = 195 meters.)

But let's double-check:  
If 1/F is ground, then 2/F is 5m up, ..., 40/F is (40-1) × 5 = 195m above ground.

But sometimes, ground is 0, and 1/F is 5m up. But since the problem says "ground floor (1/F)", we'll use their convention.

So, **distance from 1/F to 40/F = 39 × 5 = 195 meters.**

- **Acceleration (a):** 1 m/s²
- **Maximum speed (v_max):** 5 m/s

We'll assume the elevator accelerates to max speed, cruises at that speed, then decelerates to stop at the destination.

## **1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?**

Let:
- \( d = 195 \) meters
- \( a = 1 \) m/s²
- \( v_{max} = 5 \) m/s

We need to find the time taken to travel 195 meters under these constraints.

### **Step 1: Find the distance covered while accelerating to max speed**

Let \( v_f = v_{max} = 5 \) m/s

Using \( v_f^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad \):

Let initial velocity \( v_0 = 0 \):

\[
5^2 = 0 + 2 \times 1 \times d_1 \implies 25 = 2 d_1 \implies d_1 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
\]

Time to reach max speed:

\[
v_f = v_0 + a t_1 \implies 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t_1 \implies t_1 = 5 \text{ seconds}
\]

### **Step 2: Find the distance covered while decelerating from max speed to stop**

The elevator must decelerate at the same rate to stop at the top.

Let the deceleration be -1 m/s².

Let the distance covered while decelerating to stop be \( d_3 \):

Using \( v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a d \), final velocity = 0, initial velocity = 5 m/s, a = -1 m/s²

\[
0 = 5^2 + 2(-1)d_3 \implies 0 = 25 - 2 d_3 \implies 2 d_3 = 25 \implies d_3 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
\]

Time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0:

\[
0 = 5 + (-1) t_3 \implies -5 = -1 t_3 \implies t_3 = 5 \text{ seconds}
\]

### **Step 3: Distance covered at constant speed**

Let the distance at constant speed be \( d_2 \):

\[
d = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \implies 195 = 12.5 + d_2 + 12.5 \implies d_2 = 195 - 25 = 170 \text{ meters}
\]

Time at constant speed:

\[
t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_{max}} = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \text{ seconds}
\]

### **Step 4: Total time**

\[
t_{total} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 \text{ seconds}
\]

### **Answer to Question 1:**

\[
\boxed{44 \text{ seconds}}
\]

## **2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Let's clarify the scenario:

- Both get on at 1/F.
- First person wants to go to 10/F.
- Second person wants to go to 30/F.

Assuming the elevator serves both, it will go to the higher floor (30/F), and the first person will get off at 10/F.

But the question is: **How long does it take for the lift to reach the destination of the second person (30/F), considering it must stop at 10/F for the first person?**

Let's break it down:

- 1/F → 10/F: 9 floors up (since 1/F is ground, 10/F is 9 floors above)
  \[
  d_1 = 9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ meters}
  \]
- 10/F → 30/F: 20 floors up
  \[
  d_2 = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters}
  \]
- Total distance to 30/F from 1/F: 29 floors up (from 1/F to 30/F is 29 × 5 = 145 meters)

But since the elevator must stop at 10/F, we need to account for:
- Accelerating to max speed
- Cruising
- Decelerating to stop at 10/F
- Then accelerating again to max speed
- Cruising
- Decelerating to stop at 30/F

Let's break it into segments:

### **Segment 1: 1/F → 10/F (45 meters)**

Let’s analyze this short trip first.

#### **Does the elevator reach max speed before 10/F?**

Distance to accelerate to 5 m/s is 12.5 meters (as before).

So, it will reach max speed before reaching 10/F.

Let’s find the time and speed at 10/F.

Let’s let the elevator accelerate for 12.5 meters to reach 5 m/s.

Distance left to 10/F after reaching max speed:  
45 - 12.5 = 32.5 meters

Now, it will continue at 5 m/s for some distance, but let's check if it needs to start decelerating before reaching 10/F.

But since 10/F is an intermediate stop, the elevator will decelerate to stop at 10/F.

But to minimize time, it would accelerate to some speed, then decelerate to stop at 10/F.

But with the given acceleration and max speed, let's see if it can reach max speed before needing to decelerate.

Let’s let the elevator accelerate to some speed v, then decelerate to stop at 10/F.

Let’s let the distance covered while accelerating to v be d_a, and while decelerating from v to 0 be d_d.

Let the total distance be 45 m.

Let the acceleration phase be at +1 m/s², deceleration at -1 m/s².

Let t1 = time accelerating to v, t2 = time decelerating to 0.

From symmetry (since acceleration and deceleration are equal in magnitude):

\[
d_a = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2
\]
\[
v = a t_1
\]
\[
d_d = v t_2 - \frac{1}{2} a t_2^2
\]
But since deceleration is -a, and final velocity is 0:

\[
0 = v - a t_2 \implies t_2 = \frac{v}{a} = t_1
\]
And
\[
d_d = v t_2 - \frac{1}{2} a t_2^2 = v t_1 - \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2
\]
But v = a t_1, so:
\[
d_d = a t_1^2 - \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 = d_a
\]
So, the distance covered accelerating and decelerating are equal.

Let total distance:
\[
d_a + d_c + d_d
\]
But if the elevator never reaches max speed (if the distance is less than 2 × 12.5 = 25 meters for acceleration and deceleration), it won't reach max speed.

But 45 m > 25 m, so it can reach max speed and then must start decelerating before reaching 10/F.

But actually, for a short trip, the elevator will accelerate up to some point, then decelerate to stop at 10/F.

But with the given acceleration, the optimal way is to accelerate to some speed v, then decelerate to stop at
