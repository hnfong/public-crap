 This statement is suggesting a method to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, specifically focusing on multiples of 12 degrees Celsius. The method is based on the observation that when the temperature increases by 12 degrees Celsius, the digits in the Fahrenheit temperature reading will "flip" or invert their order.

For example, let's look at some temperatures in Celsius and their corresponding Fahrenheit values:

1. 0°C = 32°F
2. 12°C = 54°F (the digits "3" and "2" from 32°F are inverted)
3. 24°C = 75°F (the digits "5" and "4" from 54°F are inverted)
4. 36°C = 97°F (the digits "7" and "5" from 75°F are inverted)

As you can see, every time the Celsius temperature increases by 12 degrees, the digits in the Fahrenheit temperature reading invert their order. This is a simple way to remember and estimate Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions for multiples of 12°C. However, it's important to note that this method is not accurate for temperatures that are not multiples of 12°C.

In general, to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit for any temperature, you can use the formula:

Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32

For example, to convert 20°C to Fahrenheit:

Fahrenheit = (20 × 9/5) + 32
Fahrenheit = 68°F

So, while the "inverted digits" method can be a helpful memory aid for multiples of 12°C, it's not a reliable method for converting all Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit. [end of text]
