Q1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons. It is the product of the first four prime numbers (2 × 3 × 5 × 7), which makes it a highly composite number. This means it has many factors, which is useful in various mathematical contexts. It is also the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of four cubes in two different ways (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 5^3 + 6^3). Additionally, 120 degrees is a common angle in geometry, and it is the number of minutes in two hours, making it a convenient unit for time calculations.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two solutions:
x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes to make one round trip. The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. The time for one trip is distance divided by speed:

Time for one trip = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the number of round trips the train can make is:

Number of trips = 24 hours / (10/3 hours per trip) = 24 * 3/10 = 7.2

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 7 full round trips in a day.

I hope these explanations are helpful! Let me know if you have any more questions. I am not sure, but I think the answer is correct based on the information provided. Is there anything else you would like to know?<|im_end|>
