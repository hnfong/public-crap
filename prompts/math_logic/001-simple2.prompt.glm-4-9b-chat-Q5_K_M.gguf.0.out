Q1: The significance of the number 120 can be attributed to several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial of 5**: 120 is 5! (5 factorial), which means it is the product of all positive integers up to 5 (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: 120 is the 10th Fibonacci number, which is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

3. **Triangle Numbers**: 120 is the 15th triangle number, which is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15).

4. **Cubic Root**: 120 is the cube root of 1728 (120^3 = 1728).

5. **Multiples**: 120 is a multiple of many numbers, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

6. **Perfect Square**: 120 is the sum of two squares (10^2 + 6^2).

7. **Catalan Number**: 120 is the 6th Catalan number, which is used in combinatorial mathematics.

8. **Prime Factorization**: The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 × 3 × 5, which is a combination of the first three prime numbers.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

For the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / (2(1))
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two solutions:

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities that are 200 km apart at an average speed of 60 km/h, we first need to calculate the time it takes to make one round trip.

The time for one trip (one way) is distance divided by speed:

Time for one trip = Distance / Speed
Time for one trip = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time for one trip = 10/3 hours or 3.33 hours

A round trip is twice this distance, so:

Time for one round trip = 2 * Time for one trip
Time for one round trip = 2 * 10/3 hours
Time for one round trip = 20/3 hours or 6.67 hours

Now, we need to find out how many round trips can be made within a full day (24 hours):

Number of round trips = Total time available / Time for one round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours
Number of round trips ≈ 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of round trips = 3

So the train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
