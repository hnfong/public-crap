Let's carefully examine the statement:

**"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."**

At first glance, this sounds like a memory trick or pattern suggesting that every 12°C increase results in a Fahrenheit temperature where the digits are the reverse (inverted) of the Celsius value. Let’s test this idea with actual conversions and see if it holds.

---

### Step 1: Recall the Celsius to Fahrenheit formula

The correct formula is:

\[
°F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
\]

Let’s compute Fahrenheit values for multiples of 12°C and see if the digits are "inverted".

---

### Try 12°C:

\[
12°C → (12 × 9/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F ≈ 54°F
\]

Digits:  
- 12 → digits: 1, 2  
- 54 → digits: 5, 4  
Is 54 the inverse of 12? No — inverse of "12" would be "21", not "54".

So 12°C → 54°F — not digit inversion.

---

### Try 24°C (12 × 2):

\[
24°C → (24 × 9/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F ≈ 75°F
\]

Digits:  
- 24 → 2, 4  
- 75 → 7, 5  
Inverse of 24 is 42 — not 75.

No match.

---

### Try 16°C:

Wait — maybe it's not every 12°C, but specific temperatures where the digits are reverses?

Let’s look for Celsius and Fahrenheit values that are digit reversals of each other.

Try 16°C:

\[
16°C → (16 × 9/5) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F
\]

16 vs 61 — 61 is reverse of 16!  
But 60.8°F is closer to 61, so approximately yes.

Now try 28°C:

\[
28°C → (28 × 9/5) + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F
\]

28 → 82? 82 is reverse of 28!  
And 82.4 is very close to 82.

Interesting!

Now try 16°C and 28°C — difference is 12°C.

Try next: 28 + 12 = 40°C

\[
40°C → (40 × 9/5) + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104°F
\]

40 → 04? 104? 04 is 4, not 104. No digit inversion.

But wait — what about 4°C?

\[
4°C → (4 × 9/5) + 32 = 7.2 + 32 = 39.2°F ≈ 39°F
\]

4 → 39? Inverse of 4 is 40 or 4 — not 39.

But earlier we saw:

- 16°C ≈ 61°F → digits reversed
- 28°C ≈ 82°F → digits reversed

Let’s go backward: 16 - 12 = 4°C → 39.2°F → not 43 or 93.

But 4°C → ~39°F — not a digit reversal.

Wait — what about 82°F → 28°C? That works.

And 61°F → 16°C? Let's check:

\[
61°F → (61 - 32) × 5/9 = 29 × 5/9 ≈ 16.1°C → yes, ~16°C
\]

So:
- 16°C ↔ 61°F → digits reversed
- 28°C ↔ 82°F → digits reversed

Now, is there another?

Try 4°C → 39.2°F → not 43 or 93.

Try 61°C → (61 × 9/5) + 32 = 109.8 + 32 = 141.8°F → 142°F — 61 vs 142? No.

Try 82°C → way too high: (82 × 1.8) + 32 = 147.6 + 32 = 179.6°F — no.

So only two known cases where Celsius and Fahrenheit values are digit reversals:

- 16°C ↔ 61°F
- 28°C ↔ 82°F

And the difference between 16 and 28 is 12°C.

So the statement **"every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** seems to be a **misleading or incorrect generalization** based on a curious coincidence between two temperature points:

- 16°C ≈ 61°F
- 28°C ≈ 82°F

These are **digit reversals**, and they are **12 degrees apart**.

But it does **not** continue:

- 28 + 12 = 40°C → 104°F → not 04 or 40
- 40 + 12 = 52°C → (52 × 1.8) + 32 = 93.6 + 32 = 125.6°F → 52 vs 125? No
- 52 + 12 = 64°C → 147.2°F → no

So the pattern **does not repeat every 12°C**.

---

### Conclusion:

The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is **not accurate** as a general rule.

It likely stems from noticing a **coincidental digit reversal** at two specific temperatures:

- **16°C ≈ 61°F**
- **28°C ≈ 82°F**

These two points are 12°C apart, and their Fahrenheit equivalents are digit reversals of the Celsius values.

But this is **just a coincidence** and **does not hold** for other temperatures.

---

### Final Answer:

❌ The statement is **not correct** as a general rule.

✅ There are **two known coincidences**:
- 16°C ≈ 61°F (digits reversed)
- 28°C ≈ 82°F (digits reversed)

These are 12°C apart, which may have led to the myth.

But **this pattern does not repeat**, so it's **not a reliable or useful method** for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

For accurate conversion, use the formula:
\[
°F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
\]

Or approximate:  
°C to °F: Double the °C, subtract 10%, then add 32.  
Or: °C × 2 + 30 (rough estimate). [end of text]
