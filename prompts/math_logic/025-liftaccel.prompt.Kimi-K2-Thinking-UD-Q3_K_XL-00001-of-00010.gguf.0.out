We need to answer three questions about a lift/elevator in a 40-story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. So total height from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F) is (40-1)*5 = 39*5 = 195 meters? Wait: The building has 40 stories. Ground floor is 1/F. Top floor is 40/F. So there are 39 intervals between floors? Actually, if ground floor is floor 1, then floor 2 is 5m above, floor 3 is 10m above, etc. So floor 40 is at height (40-1)*5 = 195 m above ground floor. But sometimes building definitions: ground floor is floor 0? But here they say ground floor (1/F). So floor numbers start at 1. So floor 1 is at height 0. Floor 2 at 5m, ..., floor 40 at (40-1)*5 = 195m. So the distance from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F) is 195 meters.

The lift has acceleration/deceleration magnitude of 1 m/s^2. Maximum speed is 5 m/s.

We need to compute travel times for the lift moving between floors, considering acceleration and deceleration phases.

Assuming the lift starts from rest at ground floor, accelerates at 1 m/s^2 until it reaches max speed 5 m/s, then cruises at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s^2 to stop at destination floor.

We need to compute time for each trip.

First, we need to determine the distance needed to accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s at 1 m/s^2, and the time taken.

Acceleration a = 1 m/s^2, max speed v_max = 5 m/s.

Time to accelerate to v_max: t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 s.

Distance traveled during acceleration: d_acc = (1/2) a t^2 = 0.5 * 1 * 5^2 = 0.5 * 25 = 12.5 m.

Similarly, deceleration phase is symmetric: same time t_dec = 5 s, same distance d_dec = 12.5 m.

So total distance for acceleration + deceleration = 25 m.

If the total travel distance D is less than 25 m, the lift cannot reach max speed; it will accelerate and decelerate with a shorter time.

If D >= 25 m, then the lift will have acceleration phase, constant speed phase, and deceleration phase.

Thus for each trip we need to compute D, compare to 25 m.

Now the questions:

1. Ground floor to top floor: D = 195 m > 25 m, so it will reach max speed.

Time for acceleration and deceleration: each 5 s, total 10 s.

Distance covered in acceleration and deceleration: 25 m.

Remaining distance at constant speed: D_cruise = D - d_acc - d_dec = 195 - 25 = 170 m.

Time at constant speed: t_cruise = D_cruise / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 s.

Total time: t_total = t_acc + t_cruise + t_dec = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 s.

Thus answer to Q1: 44 seconds.

But we need to be careful: The lift starts at ground floor (1/F) and goes to top floor (40/F). Does it need to stop at intermediate floors? No, it's a direct trip. So the above is correct.

Now Q2: Two people get on the same lift on ground floor. First person goes to 10/F, second person goes to 30/F. So the lift will stop at floor 10 and floor 30. We need to compute the total time for the lift to travel from 1/F to 10/F, stop, then continue to 30/F. The question: "How long does it take?" It could be interpreted as the total time for the lift to deliver both people to their respective floors. That includes the time to travel to 10/F, stop (maybe open doors?), then travel to 30/F. However, the problem does not specify door opening times or dwell times. Usually in such physics problems, we ignore door opening times and just consider the movement time, including deceleration to stop and acceleration to leave. So we need to compute the time for the lift to go from 1/F to 10/F, then from 10/F to 30/F. However, the second person is going to 30/F, so the lift must continue after the first person gets off. The question might be asking for the total time for the second person to reach 30/F (i.e., the total journey time from ground to 30/F with an intermediate stop at 10/F). Or it might be asking for the total time the lift takes to complete both deliveries (i.e., to get to 10/F and then to 30/F). The phrasing: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?" This is ambiguous. Usually, they want the total time for the lift to reach 30/F, which includes the stop at 10/F. But we need to consider that the lift stops at 10/F to let the first person off, which involves deceleration to stop, then acceleration to continue. So we need to compute the time for the first leg (1/F to 10/F), then the second leg (10/F to 30/F). The total time for the second person to reach 30/F is the sum of both legs. The first person gets off at 10/F earlier, but the question likely wants the total time until the second person reaches 30/F. However, they might also want the time for the first person to reach 10/F. But the phrasing "How long does it take?" could refer to the entire trip for the lift to complete both stops. Let's interpret as the total time from start until the lift reaches 30/F (the final destination for the second person). That seems plausible.

Thus we need to compute:

Leg 1: from floor 1 to floor 10.

Distance: (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45 m.

Leg 2: from floor 10 to floor 30.

Distance: (30-10)*5 = 20*5 = 100 m.

But note that after stopping at floor 10, the lift must accelerate again from rest. So each leg is independent: the lift starts from rest at floor 1, goes to floor 10, stops; then starts from rest at floor 10, goes to floor 30.

Thus total time = time for leg 1 + time for leg 2.

We need to compute each leg's travel time.

Leg 1: D1 = 45 m.

Check if D1 >= 25 m? Yes, 45 > 25, so it will reach max speed.

Time for acceleration and deceleration: each 5 s, total 10 s.

Distance covered in acc+dec: 25 m.

Remaining distance: D1_cruise = 45 - 25 = 20 m.

Time cruising: t_cruise1 = 20 / 5 = 4 s.

Total time for leg 1: t1 = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 s.

Leg 2: D2 = 100 m.

Again, D2 > 25 m, so it will accelerate, cruise, decelerate.

Time acc+dec: 10 s.

Distance acc+dec: 25 m.

Remaining distance: D2_cruise = 100 - 25 = 75 m.

Time cruising: t_cruise2 = 75 / 5 = 15 s.

Total time for leg 2: t2 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 s.

Total time for the whole trip: t_total = t1 + t2 = 14 + 25 = 39 s.

But wait: The lift might not need to accelerate to max speed for the second leg if the distance is short? But 100 m > 25 m, so it will.

Thus total time = 39 s.

But we need to consider that the lift might not need to decelerate to zero at floor 10 if the first person is getting off, but it must stop. So
