 Let's solve these problems step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - The lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s.
   - Time to reach maximum speed: \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{1 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \( d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \)

2. **Constant Speed Phase:**
   - Total height of the building: \( 40 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 200 \, \text{m} \)
   - Distance remaining after acceleration: \( 200 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 187.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at constant speed: \( t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{187.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 37.5 \, \text{s} \)

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s.
   - Time to decelerate: \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{1 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Distance covered during deceleration: \( d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \)

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time to accelerate + Time at constant speed + Time to decelerate
   - Total time = 5 s + 37.5 s + 5 s = 47.5 s

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **First Person to 10/F:**
   - Height to 10/F: \( 10 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{m} \)
   - Acceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Distance remaining: \( 50 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 37.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at constant speed: \( t = \frac{37.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 7.5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Deceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Total time to 10/F: 5 s + 7.5 s + 5 s = 17.5 s

2. **Second Person to 30/F:**
   - Height to 30/F: \( 30 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 150 \, \text{m} \)
   - Acceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Distance remaining: \( 150 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 137.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at constant speed: \( t = \frac{137.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 27.5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Deceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Total time to 30/F: 5 s + 27.5 s + 5 s = 37.5 s

3. **Total Time:**
   - The lift stops at 10/F and then continues to 30/F.
   - Total time = Time to 10/F + Time to 30/F
   - Total time = 17.5 s + 37.5 s = 55 s

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **Minimum Time Calculation:**
   - The lift must stop at least once between 1/F and 40/F.
   - The minimum time will be when the lift stops at the floor just before 40/F, which is 39/F.

2. **First Person to 39/F:**
   - Height to 39/F: \( 39 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 195 \, \text{m} \)
   - Acceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Distance remaining: \( 195 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 182.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at constant speed: \( t = \frac{182.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 36.5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Deceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Total time to 39/F: 5 s + 36.5 s + 5 s = 46.5 s

3. **First Person to 40/F:**
   - Height to 40/F: \( 40 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 200 \, \text{m} \)
   - Acceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Distance remaining: \( 200 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 187.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at constant speed: \( t = \frac{187.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 37.5 \, \text{s} \)
   - Deceleration Phase: Same as before, 12.5 m in 5 s.
   - Total time to 40/F: 5 s + 37.5 s + 5 s = 47.5 s

4. **Total Time:**
   - The lift stops at 39/F and then continues to 40/F.
   - Total time = Time to 39/F + Time to 40/F
   - Total time = 46.5 s + 47.5 s = 94 s
