There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?
[/INST] 1. To calculate the time it takes for the lift to go from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed of the lift.

The lift accelerates at 1 m/sÂ² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s. The time it takes to reach this speed can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{v}{a} \]
where \( v \) is the maximum speed and \( a \) is the acceleration.
\[ t = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{1 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 5 \, \text{s} \]

During this time, the lift covers a distance:
\[ d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]
\[ d = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times (5 \, \text{s})^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m} \]

The total height of the building is:
\[ 40 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 200 \, \text{m} \]

The remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed is:
\[ 200 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 187.5 \, \text{m} \]

The time to cover this distance at maximum speed is:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]
\[ t = \frac{187.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 37.5 \, \text{s} \]

Finally, the lift decelerates to a stop. The deceleration time is the same as the acceleration time, which is 5 seconds.

The total time to go from the ground floor to the top floor is:
\[ 5 \, \text{s} + 37.5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} = 47.5 \, \text{s} \]

2. For the first person going to the 10th floor:
The height of the 10th floor is:
\[ 10 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 50 \, \text{m} \]

The lift accelerates to its maximum speed and then decelerates to stop at the 10th floor. The time to reach maximum speed is 5 seconds, and the distance covered during this time is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance is:
\[ 50 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 37.5 \, \text{m} \]

The time to cover this distance at maximum speed is:
\[ t = \frac{37.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 7.5 \, \text{s} \]

The total time to reach the 10th floor is:
\[ 5 \, \text{s} + 7.5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} = 17.5 \, \text{s} \]

For the second person going to the 30th floor:
The lift will stop at the 10th floor and then continue to the 30th floor. The height of the 30th floor is:
\[ 30 \, \text{floors} \times 5 \, \text{m/floor} = 150 \, \text{m} \]

The lift has already covered 50 meters to reach the 10th floor. The remaining distance to the 30th floor is:
\[ 150 \, \text{m} - 50 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{m} \]

The lift will accelerate, reach maximum speed, and then decelerate to stop at the 30th floor. The time to reach maximum speed is 5 seconds, and the distance covered during this time is 12.5 meters. The remaining distance is:
\[ 100 \, \text{m} - 12.5 \, \text{m} = 87.5 \, \text{m} \]

The time to cover this distance at maximum speed is:
\[ t = \frac{87.5 \, \text{m}}{5 \, \text{m/s}} = 17.5 \, \text{s} \]

The total time to reach the 30th floor is:
\[ 17.5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} + 17.5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} = 45 \, \text{s} \]

3. To minimize the time to reach the 40th floor with one stop, the lift should stop at the floor that requires the least additional time. The optimal floor to stop at is the one that minimizes the deceleration and acceleration time.

The lift will accelerate to its maximum speed, decelerate to stop at an intermediate floor, accelerate again to maximum speed, and finally decelerate to stop at the 40th floor. The time to reach maximum speed and decelerate to a stop is 5 seconds each.

The total time to reach the 40th floor with one stop is:
\[ 5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} + 37.5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} + 5 \, \text{s} = 57.5 \, \text{s} \]

This is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor if it has to stop at another floor between the 1st and 40th floors. [end of text]
