Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Let's solve each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - There are 40 floors.
   - Total distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. **Determine the time to travel the distance:**
   - The maximum speed of the lift is 5 meters/second.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 meters / 5 meters/second = 40 seconds.

So, it takes 40 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **Calculate the distance for the first person:**
   - First person goes to 10/F.
   - Distance = 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.

2. **Calculate the distance for the second person:**
   - Second person goes to 30/F.
   - Distance = 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.

3. **Determine the time for each person:**
   - Maximum speed of the lift is 5 meters/second.
   - Time for first person = 50 meters / 5 meters/second = 10 seconds.
   - Time for second person = 150 meters / 5 meters/second = 30 seconds.

4. **Determine the total time:**
   - The lift must stop at both floors (10/F and 30/F) before reaching the top.
   - Time to stop and start again = 2 * (acceleration time + deceleration time).
   - Acceleration time = sqrt(2 * distance / acceleration) = sqrt(2 * 50 meters / 1 m/s^2) = sqrt(100) = 10 seconds.
   - Deceleration time = 10 seconds (same as acceleration time).
   - Total stop time = 2 * (10 seconds + 10 seconds) = 40 seconds.

5. **Calculate the total time including travel:**
   - Total time = Time for first person + Time for second person + Total stop time = 10 seconds + 30 seconds + 40 seconds = 80 seconds.

So, it takes 80 seconds for the lift to get to both floors and then to the top floor.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **Calculate the distance for the first person:**
   - First person goes to 40/F.
   - Distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. **Determine the time for the first person:**
   - Maximum speed of the lift is 5 meters/second.
   - Time = 200 meters / 5 meters/second = 40 seconds.

3. **Determine the minimum stop time:**
   - To minimize the stop time, the lift should stop at the floor that minimizes the total distance traveled.
   - The optimal floor to stop at is the floor that is equidistant from the ground floor and the 40/F floor.
   - This floor is 20/F (halfway between 1/F and 40/F).
   - Distance to 20/F = 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.
   - Distance from 20/F to 40/F = 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.
   - Total distance = 100 meters + 100 meters = 200 meters.

4. **Calculate the total time including travel and stop:**
   - Time for first person = 40 seconds.
   - Time to stop and start again = 2 * (acceleration time + deceleration time).
   - Acceleration time = sqrt(2 * distance / acceleration) = sqrt(2 * 100 meters / 1 m/s^2) = sqrt(200) = 14.14 seconds.
   - Deceleration time = 14.14 seconds (same as acceleration time).
   - Total stop time = 2 * (14.14 seconds + 14.14 seconds) = 56.56 seconds.

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for first person + Total stop time = 40 seconds + 56.56 seconds = 96.56 seconds.

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is approximately 96.56 seconds. [end of text]
