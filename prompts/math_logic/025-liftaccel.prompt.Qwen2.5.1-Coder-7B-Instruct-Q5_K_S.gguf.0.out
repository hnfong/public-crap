Sure, I'll answer all the questions step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - There are 40 floors.
   - Total distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. **Determine the time to reach the maximum speed:**
   - Maximum speed = 5 m/s.
   - Acceleration = 1 m/s².
   - Time to reach maximum speed = \( \frac{\text{Maximum speed}}{\text{Acceleration}} = \frac{5 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m/s}^2} = 5 \text{ seconds} \).

3. **Calculate the distance covered during acceleration:**
   - Distance covered during acceleration = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Acceleration} \times (\text{Time to reach maximum speed})^2 \).
   - Distance covered during acceleration = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 25 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \).

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed:**
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered during acceleration = 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters.

5. **Calculate the time to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - Time to cover remaining distance = \( \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Maximum speed}} = \frac{187.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 37.5 \text{ seconds} \).

6. **Calculate the time to decelerate:**
   - Deceleration time = Time to reach maximum speed = 5 seconds.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to accelerate + Time to cover remaining distance + Time to decelerate = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds + 5 seconds = 47.5 seconds.

**Answer to Question 1:** It takes 47.5 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

1. **Calculate the distance for the first person:**
   - First person goes to 10/F.
   - Distance = 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.

2. **Calculate the distance for the second person:**
   - Second person goes to 30/F.
   - Distance = 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.

3. **Determine the time to reach the maximum speed:**
   - Maximum speed = 5 m/s.
   - Acceleration = 1 m/s².
   - Time to reach maximum speed = 5 seconds.

4. **Calculate the distance covered during acceleration:**
   - Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.

5. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed:**
   - Remaining distance for first person = 50 meters - 12.5 meters = 37.5 meters.
   - Remaining distance for second person = 150 meters - 12.5 meters = 137.5 meters.

6. **Calculate the time to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - Time to cover remaining distance for first person = 37.5 seconds.
   - Time to cover remaining distance for second person = 137.5 seconds.

7. **Calculate the time to decelerate:**
   - Deceleration time = 5 seconds.

8. **Calculate the total time for each person:**
   - Total time for first person = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds + 5 seconds = 47.5 seconds.
   - Total time for second person = 5 seconds + 137.5 seconds + 5 seconds = 147.5 seconds.

9. **Determine the total time for both people:**
   - Since the lift cannot stop in between floors, the total time will be the maximum of the two times.
   - Total time = 147.5 seconds.

**Answer to Question 2:** It takes 147.5 seconds for the lift to reach both floors.

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. **Calculate the distance for the first person:**
   - First person goes to 40/F.
   - Distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. **Determine the time to reach the maximum speed:**
   - Maximum speed = 5 m/s.
   - Acceleration = 1 m/s².
   - Time to reach maximum speed = 5 seconds.

3. **Calculate the distance covered during acceleration:**
   - Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered at maximum speed:**
   - Remaining distance = 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters.

5. **Calculate the time to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:**
   - Time to cover remaining distance = 37.5 seconds.

6. **Calculate the time to decelerate:**
   - Deceleration time = 5 seconds.

7. **Calculate the total time for the first person:**
   - Total time = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds + 5 seconds = 47.5 seconds.

8. **Determine the minimum time for the second person:**
   - The second person must stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F.
   - The minimum distance the second person can travel is 1 floor (5 meters).
   - Time to reach maximum speed = 5 seconds.
   - Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.
   - Remaining distance = 5 meters - 12.5 meters = -7.5 meters (not possible, so the second person must stop at a higher floor).
   - Let's assume the second person stops at 20/F.
   - Distance to 20/F = 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.
   - Time to reach maximum speed = 5 seconds.
   - Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters.
   - Remaining distance = 100 meters - 12.5 meters = 87.5 meters.
   - Time to cover remaining distance = 17.5 seconds.
   - Time to decelerate = 5 seconds.
   - Total time for second person = 5 seconds + 17.5 seconds + 5 seconds = 27.5 seconds.

9. **Determine the total time for both people:**
   - Since the lift cannot stop in between floors, the total time will be the maximum of the two times.
   - Total time = 47.5 seconds.

**Answer to Question 3:** The minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 47.5 seconds. [end of text]
