The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device to help remember a pattern in the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. However, it's important to clarify that this is not a mathematically accurate rule for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let me explain it clearly and provide examples.

### What the statement means:
The idea is that for every 12°C increase, the digits in the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature are inverted (i.e., the first digit becomes the second, and vice versa). This is a pattern that happens to work for certain specific temperature ranges, but it is not a general rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Example:
1. **At 12°C:**
   - The Fahrenheit equivalent is approximately **54°F** (since 12°C × 1.8 + 32 = 53.6°F, rounded to 54°F).
   - The digits in 54°F are indeed inverted compared to 12°C (1 and 2 become 5 and 4).

2. **At 21°C:**
   - The Fahrenheit equivalent is approximately **70°F** (since 21°C × 1.8 + 32 = 69.8°F, rounded to 70°F).
   - The digits in 70°F are inverted compared to 21°C (2 and 1 become 7 and 0).

### Why this is not a general rule:
The Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion formula is:
\[ F = (C \times 1.8) + 32 \]
This formula does not follow a simple "digits inverted" pattern for all temperatures. The mnemonic works for specific cases (like 12°C and 21°C) but fails for most other temperatures.

### Correct Conversion Example:
- **At 100°C:**
  - The Fahrenheit equivalent is **212°F** (since 100°C × 1.8 + 32 = 212°F).
  - The digits in 212°F are not inverted compared to 100°C (1 and 0 do not become 2 and 1).

### Conclusion:
The statement is a helpful memory trick for specific cases but is not a reliable method for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit in general. For accurate conversions, use the formula:
\[ F = (C \times 1.8) + 32 \] [end of text]
