Q1: The number 120 is significant because it is a composite number, which means it has more than two positive divisors. It is also a multiple of 3 and 5, and it is a perfect square (10^2) and a perfect cube (6^3). It is also the sum of the first four consecutive numbers (1+2+3+4=10), the sum of the first four odd numbers (1+3+5+7=16), and the sum of the first four squares (1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=30).

Q2: The quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is x = [7 Â± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2. The square root of 49 is 7 and the square root of 72 is approximately 8.6. So, the solutions are x = (7 + 8.6) / 2 and x = (7 - 8.6) / 2. The first solution is approximately 5.3 and the second is approximately -1.3. However, since we cannot have a negative distance, the solution is x = 5.3.

Q3: The train can make 120 round trips within a full day because it travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, which means it covers a distance of 60 km every hour. Therefore, in a day (24 hours), it covers a total distance of 60 km/h * 24 h = 1440 km. If the distance between the two cities is 200 km, then it can make 1440 km / 200 km = 7.2 trips. Since we cannot have a fraction of a trip, the train can make 7 round trips within a full day.
