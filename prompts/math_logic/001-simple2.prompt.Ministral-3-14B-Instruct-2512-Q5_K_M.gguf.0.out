### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number **120** is highly significant in mathematics, science, and culture. Here are some of its interesting properties:

#### **1. Highly Composite Number**
- 120 is a **highly composite number**, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
- **Divisors of 120**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (total of **16 divisors**).

#### **2. Factorial and Permutations**
- 120 is **5! (5 factorial)**, meaning:
  \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).
- It is the number of ways to arrange **5 distinct objects** (permutations).

#### **3. Abundant Number**
- 120 is an **abundant number** because the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself.
  Sum of proper divisors: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240 > 120\).

#### **4. Harshad (Niven) Number**
- 120 is a **Harshad number** because it is divisible by the sum of its digits (\(1 + 2 + 0 = 3\), and \(120 ÷ 3 = 40\)).

#### **5. Superabundant Number**
- 120 is the smallest number for which the sum of the reciprocals of its divisors is maximized.

#### **6. In Geometry and Physics**
- **Regular Icosahedron**: A 3D shape with 120 rotational symmetries.
- **Atomic Number**: The element **Nobelium (No)** has an atomic number of 120 (though it is synthetic and not naturally occurring).

#### **7. Cultural and Historical Significance**
- **Zodiac**: In some astrological traditions, 120 degrees is a key angle (e.g., 360° ÷ 3 = 120°).
- **Religion**: In some interpretations, 120 is linked to biblical references (e.g., the lifespan of Methuselah in some traditions).
- **Music**: A **120 BPM (beats per minute)** is a common tempo in music (e.g., "120 BPM" by Björk).

#### **8. Number Theory**
- **Practical Number**: Every number up to 120 can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of 120.
- **Refactorable Number**: The product of its proper divisors is a multiple of the number itself.

#### **9. In Computing**
- **ASCII/Unicode**: Some control characters or extended ASCII codes use values around 120.
- **Memory Addressing**: In some systems, 120 is a meaningful address or offset.

#### **10. Miscellaneous**
- **Sports**: In some games (e.g., cricket), 120 runs or overs may have symbolic meaning.
- **Time**: 120 minutes = **2 hours**.

**Fun Fact**: 120 is also the number of **symmetries of a cube** (rotational and reflectional).

### **Q2: Solve the equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)**

This is a **quadratic equation** of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). We can solve it using:
1. **Factoring**
2. **Quadratic Formula**: \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)

#### **Method 1: Factoring**
We look for two numbers that:
- Multiply to \( a \times c = 1 \times (-18) = -18 \).
- Add to \( b = -7 \).

The numbers are **-9** and **+2** because:
\( -9 \times 2 = -18 \) and \( -9 + 2 = -7 \).

Rewrite the equation:
\( x^2 - 9x + 2x - 18 = 0 \)
Group:
\( (x^2 - 9x) + (2x - 18) = 0 \)
Factor:
\( x(x - 9) + 2(x - 9) = 0 \)
\( (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0 \)

Set each factor to zero:
1. \( x + 2 = 0 \) → \( x = -2 \)
2. \( x - 9 = 0 \) → \( x = 9 \)

**Solutions**: \( x = -2 \) or \( x = 9 \).

#### **Method 2: Quadratic Formula**
Given \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -18 \):
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

So:
1. \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

**Solutions**: \( x = 9 \) or \( x = -2 \).

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Time for One Trip**
- **Distance (one way)**: 200 km
- **Speed**: 60 km/h
- **Time = Distance / Speed**:
  \( \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.\overline{3} \text{ hours} \) (or 3 hours and 20 minutes).

#### **Step 2: Calculate Time for a Round Trip**
- A **round trip** = going to the other city and returning.
- **Total distance**: 200 km (out) + 200 km (back) = 400 km.
- **Time for round trip**:
  \( \frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.\overline{6} \text{ hours} \) (or 6 hours and 40 minutes).

#### **Step 3: Calculate Number of Round Trips in a Day**
- **Total time in a day**: 24 hours.
- **Number of round trips**:
  \( \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \).

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can complete **3 full round trips** in 24 hours.
- **Time for 3 round trips**: \( 3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20 \text{ hours} \).
- **Remaining time**: \( 24 - 20 = 4 \text{ hours} \), which is not enough for another full round trip (needs 6.67 hours).

#### **Alternative Interpretation: One-Way Trips**
If the question means **one-way trips** (e.g., leaving City A and returning to City A counts as 2 one-way trips):
- **Time per one-way trip**: \( \
