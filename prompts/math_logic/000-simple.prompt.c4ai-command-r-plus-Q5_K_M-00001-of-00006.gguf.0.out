Q1: 1+1 = 2

Q2: 6*7 = 42

Q3: 83*59 = 4907

Q4: 349*683 = 238367

Q5: 6043*7489 = 45255927

Q6: Solving the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we get x = 5

Q7: 25% of 80 is 20

Q8: The shopkeeper should give you a $5 bill, a $10 bill, and $5 in change, totaling $20.

Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units. 

Q10: Katherine's mother has four children. 

Q11: Evaluating the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1, the answer is 6.

Q12: If there are 5 guests, they will need 5 slices of birthday cake, assuming one slice per guest.

Q13: The shirt on sale for 20% off would cost $20, as 20% of $25 is $5, and subtracting that from the original price gives you the sale price. 

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes. 

Q15: For a group of 22 people, you would need 6 taxis, with one taxi extra for one person. 

Q16: In a triangle, the sum of all three angles is always 180 degrees. If we have two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 180: 180 - (31 + 62) = 87 degrees.
