Sure! Let's go through each question step by step.

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step 1: Understand what is being asked**  
We are to explore the mathematical and possibly historical or cultural significance of the number **120**, focusing on its interesting properties.

---

**Step 2: List mathematical properties of 120**

1. **Factorial Connection**:  
   - 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120  
   - This makes 120 the **fifth factorial**. It's the smallest number that is both a factorial and a **highly composite number**.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   - 120 has **16 positive divisors**:  
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120  
   - This means it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer (except 60, which has 12 divisors — 120 has more), so it's highly composite.

3. **Triangular Number?**  
   - A triangular number is of the form $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $.  
   - Check: $ \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120 $ → Yes!  
   - So, **120 is the 15th triangular number**.

4. **Hexagonal Number?**  
   - Hexagonal numbers: $ n(2n - 1) $  
   - Try $ n = 8 $: $ 8 \times 15 = 120 $ → Yes!  
   - So, **120 is the 8th hexagonal number**.

5. **Tetrahedral Number?**  
   - Tetrahedral numbers: $ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} $  
   - Try $ n = 8 $: $ \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6} = 120 $ → Yes!  
   - So, **120 is the 8th tetrahedral number**.

6. **Sum of first 15 natural numbers**:  
   - $ 1 + 2 + \dots + 15 = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120 $ → Confirmed.

7. **Abundant Number**:  
   - Sum of proper divisors of 120:  
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240  
   - Since 240 > 120, it's **abundant**.

8. **Practical Number**:  
   - 120 is a **practical number**, meaning every number less than 120 can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of 120.

9. **In Geometry**:  
   - The **dodecahedron** has 120 faces in its dual (the 120-cell, a 4D polytope), but more directly:  
   - The **regular dodecahedron** has 12 pentagonal faces, 30 edges, and 20 vertices — not directly 120, but 120 appears in higher-dimensional geometry.

10. **Cultural/Other Significance**:  
    - In **Judaism**, the age of **Moses** is said to be 120 years (Deuteronomy 31:2), and it's considered a full lifespan.
    - In **timekeeping**, 120 seconds = 2 minutes, 120 minutes = 2 hours.
    - In **sports**, 120 is the number of minutes in a standard NBA game (4 quarters of 12 minutes each).
    - In **chemistry**, the atomic number of **unbinilium** (hypothetical element) is 120.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation**  
Standard form: $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $  
Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = -7 $, $ c = -18 $

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula**  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Plug in values:
$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

$$
\sqrt{121} = 11
$$

So:
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

**Step 3: Solve both cases**

- $ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $
- $ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $

✅ **Answer**: $ x = 9 $ or $ x = -2 $

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1: Understand what a round trip is**  
- One round trip = go from city A to city B (200 km), then return from B to A (200 km)  
- Total distance per round trip = 200 + 200 = **400 km**

**Step 2: Time for one round trip**  
Speed = 60 km/h  
Distance = 400 km  
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.6667 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 3: Total time in a day**  
1 full day = 24 hours

**Step 4: Number of round trips in 24 hours**  
$$
\text{Number} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$

Since the train can't make a partial trip, we take the **whole number part**.

✅ **Answer**: The train can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

### ✅ Final Answers:

**Q1**: 120 is significant because it is:
- 5! (factorial)
- 15th triangular number
- 8th hexagonal and tetrahedral number
- Highly composite (16 divisors)
- Abundant and practical number
- Symbolic in religion (Moses lived 120 years)

**Q2**: $ x = 9 $ or $ x = -2 $

**Q3**: **3 round trips** in a full day
