Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4997
Q4: 349 * 683 = 239377
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 45388677
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   I am not sure, but I think the answer is x = 6
Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   The shopkeeper should give you back $5 as change.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the side length. So, with a side length of 5 units, the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   Katherine's mother has 4 children in total (Katherine plus two brothers and a sister).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
   3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   I am not sure, but I think the answer depends on how many slices the cake is cut into. If each guest gets one slice, then 5 guests would need 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   The sale price would be 80% of the original price, because there's a 20% discount. So, the sale price is 0.80 * $25 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is a period of 2 hours and 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding the 15 minutes from 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM, we get 120 + 15 = 135 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   To find out how many taxis are needed for 22 people, we divide the number of people by the number of passengers a taxi can carry: 22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis. Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis to accommodate 22 people.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. If two angles measure 31 degrees and 62 degrees, we subtract these from 180 to find the measure of the third angle: 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.<|im_end|>
