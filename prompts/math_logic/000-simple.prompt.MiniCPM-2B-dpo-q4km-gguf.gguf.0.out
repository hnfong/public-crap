<AI> Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4857
Q4: 349 * 683 = 239677
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 45111227
Q6: The equation is: 3x + 7 = 22
To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7; 3x = 15; Divide by 3: x = 5
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20
Q8: The final change would be $1. The shopkeeper initially received two $20 bills, which is $40, and you gave an additional $5, so you gave a total of $45. The shopkeeper is left with $15, so the final change is $1.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units would be 20.
Q10: The mother has 3 children.
Q11: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: There will be 12 slices of cake.
Q13: A shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, so the sale price is $25 * 0.8 = $20.
Q14: 6:30 PM is 3 hours and 15 minutes after 3:45 PM. To convert this into minutes, multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes/hour + 15 minutes = 195 minutes.
Q15: The taxi can carry 4 passengers, so 22 people would need 22/4 = 5 taxis.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.</s>
