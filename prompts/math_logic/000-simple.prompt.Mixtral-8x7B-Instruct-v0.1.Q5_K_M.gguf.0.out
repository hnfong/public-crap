 A1: 1+1 equals 2.

A2: 6*7 equals 42.

A3: 83*59 equals 4877.

A4: 349*683 equals 238,497.

A5: 6043*7489 equals 45,168,007.

A6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22 for x, first subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

A7: 25% of 80 is (25/100)*80 = 20.

A8: If you gave the shopkeeper two $20 bills and a $5 bill, you paid $45 for a $15 book. The final change the shopkeeper should give you is $45 - $15 = $30.

A9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side. So the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 4*5 = 20 units.

A10: Katherine and her two brothers and a sister make 4 children in total.

A11: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we first do the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then we add and subtract from left to right: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

A12: If each guest needs one slice of birthday cake, then for 5 guests, you need 5 slices.

A13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, the discount amount is 0.20 * $25 = $5. The sale price is the original price minus the discount: $25 - $5 = $20.

A14: From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours and 15 minutes. From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is an additional 30 minutes. In total, there are 15 + 30 = 45 minutes left until 6:30 PM.

A15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. To carry a group of 22 people, you would need 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you'll need 6 taxis.

A16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle is 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
