Q1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!. This means 120 is the product of all positive integers up to 5: \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

2. **Divisors**: 120 has a large number of divisors. It is divisible by 16 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it a highly composite number.

3. **Sum of Divisors**: The sum of its divisors (including 120 itself) is 360.

4. **Mathematical Properties**: 
   - It is the smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 5.
   - It is a triangular number (the sum of the first 15 natural numbers).
   - It is a tetrahedral number (the sum of the first 9 triangular numbers).

5. **Cultural Significance**: In some cultures, 120 is considered a symbol of completeness or perfection.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

For the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), the coefficients are \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. Calculate the discriminant: 
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]

2. Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can find the roots:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]

3. Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
   - \(x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\)
   - \(x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)

So, the solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day, we need to calculate the time for one round trip and then see how many such trips fit into 24 hours.

1. **Calculate the time for one one-way trip**:
   - Distance between the cities = 200 km
   - Speed = 60 km/h
   - Time for one-way trip = \(\frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip**:
   - A round trip consists of two one-way trips.
   - Time for a round trip = \(2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}\)

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours**:
   - Total hours in a day = 24
   - Number of round trips = \(\frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\)

Since the train cannot complete a partial round trip, it can make 3 full round trips in a day. [end of text]
