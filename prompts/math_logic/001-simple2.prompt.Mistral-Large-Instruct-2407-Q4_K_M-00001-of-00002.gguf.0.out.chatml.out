Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance:

- **Factorization**: 120 can be factored into prime numbers as \(2^3 \times 3 \times 5\).
- **Divisors**: It has a large number of divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
- **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
- **Factorial**: It is the factorial of 5, i.e., \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
- **Geometry**: In geometry, a regular dodecahedron has 120 diagonals.

Q2: To solve the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]

2. Apply the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]

3. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2
   \]

So, the solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day (24 hours):

1. Calculate the time for one trip:
   \[
   \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the time for a round trip:
   \[
   \text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:
   \[
   \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = 3.6
   \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day.
