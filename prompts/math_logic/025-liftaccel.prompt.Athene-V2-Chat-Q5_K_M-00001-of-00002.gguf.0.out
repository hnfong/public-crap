Let's tackle each question step by step.

### Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

**Given:**
- Building height: \( 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \)
- Acceleration/deceleration: \( 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \)
- Maximum speed: \( 5 \text{ m/s} \)

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time to reach maximum speed:**
   \[
   v = at \implies 5 \text{ m/s} = 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times t \implies t = 5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered during acceleration:**
   \[
   d = \frac{1}{2}at^2 \implies d = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ m/s}^2 \times (5 \text{ s})^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance covered during deceleration:**
   Since the deceleration is the same as the acceleration, the distance covered during deceleration is also \( 12.5 \text{ meters} \).

4. **Calculate the distance covered at maximum speed:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance at max speed} = 200 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 175 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time spent at maximum speed:**
   \[
   t_{\text{max speed}} = \frac{175 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 35 \text{ seconds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time:**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{acceleration}} + t_{\text{max speed}} + t_{\text{deceleration}} = 5 \text{ s} + 35 \text{ s} + 5 \text{ s} = 45 \text{ seconds}
   \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{45 \text{ seconds}}
\]

### Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

**Given:**
- First stop: \( 10 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 50 \text{ meters} \)
- Second stop: \( 30 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 150 \text{ meters} \)

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time to reach 10/F:**
   - **Acceleration to max speed:**
     \[
     t_{\text{acceleration}} = 5 \text{ seconds}, \quad d_{\text{acceleration}} = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Distance remaining to 10/F:**
     \[
     d_{\text{remaining}} = 50 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 37.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Time at max speed to 10/F:**
     \[
     t_{\text{max speed}} = \frac{37.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 7.5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Total time to 10/F:**
     \[
     t_{\text{10/F}} = 5 \text{ s} + 7.5 \text{ s} = 12.5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to reach 30/F from 10/F:**
   - **Distance from 10/F to 30/F:**
     \[
     d_{\text{10 to 30}} = 150 \text{ meters} - 50 \text{ meters} = 100 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Deceleration to stop at 10/F:**
     \[
     t_{\text{deceleration}} = 5 \text{ seconds}, \quad d_{\text{deceleration}} = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Distance remaining to 30/F:**
     \[
     d_{\text{remaining}} = 100 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 87.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Time at max speed to 30/F:**
     \[
     t_{\text{max speed}} = \frac{87.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 17.5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Total time from 10/F to 30/F:**
     \[
     t_{\text{10 to 30}} = 5 \text{ s} + 17.5 \text{ s} = 22.5 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Total time to reach 30/F:**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{10/F}} + t_{\text{10 to 30}} = 12.5 \text{ s} + 22.5 \text{ s} = 35 \text{ seconds}
   \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{35 \text{ seconds}}
\]

### Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Given:**
- First stop: \( 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ meters/floor} = 200 \text{ meters} \)
- Second stop: Any floor between 1/F and 39/F

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the minimum time to reach 40/F with one stop:**
   - **Optimal stop:**
     To minimize the total time, the lift should stop at a floor that minimizes the additional time spent decelerating and accelerating. The optimal stop is at the midpoint of the journey, which is around the 20th floor (100 meters).

2. **Calculate the time to reach the 20th floor:**
   - **Distance to 20th floor:**
     \[
     d_{\text{20/F}} = 100 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Acceleration to max speed:**
     \[
     t_{\text{acceleration}} = 5 \text{ seconds}, \quad d_{\text{acceleration}} = 12.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Distance remaining to 20th floor:**
     \[
     d_{\text{remaining}} = 100 \text{ meters} - 12.5 \text{ meters} = 87.5 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Time at max speed to 20th floor:**
     \[
     t_{\text{max speed}} = \frac{87.5 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ m/s}} = 17.5 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Total time to 20th floor:**
     \[
     t_{\text{20/F}} = 5
