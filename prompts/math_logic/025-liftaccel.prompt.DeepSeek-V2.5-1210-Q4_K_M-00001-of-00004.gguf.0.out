### Understanding the Problem

We have a 40-story building where each floor is 5 meters tall. The elevator travels from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). The elevator has the following characteristics:

- **Acceleration/Deceleration:** 1 m/s²
- **Maximum Speed:** 5 m/s

We need to answer three questions:

1. **How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**
2. **Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**
3. **Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### Breaking Down the Problem

To solve these questions, we need to understand the motion of the elevator:

1. **Acceleration Phase:** The elevator accelerates from rest to its maximum speed.
2. **Cruising Phase:** The elevator travels at its maximum speed.
3. **Deceleration Phase:** The elevator decelerates to a stop.

We'll need to calculate the time taken for each phase and sum them up to find the total time for each scenario.

### Calculating the Total Height

First, let's determine the total height of the building:

\[ \text{Total Height} = \text{Number of Floors} \times \text{Height per Floor} \]
\[ \text{Total Height} = 40 \times 5 = 200 \text{ meters} \]

### Question 1: Time from Ground Floor to Top Floor

**Objective:** Find the total time it takes for the elevator to go from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F).

**Approach:**

1. **Acceleration Phase:**
   - **Acceleration:** 1 m/s²
   - **Initial Velocity (u):** 0 m/s
   - **Final Velocity (v):** 5 m/s (maximum speed)
   - **Time to reach maximum speed (t₁):**
     \[ v = u + at \]
     \[ 5 = 0 + 1 \times t₁ \]
     \[ t₁ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
   - **Distance covered during acceleration (d₁):**
     \[ d = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]
     \[ d₁ = 0 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 \]
     \[ d₁ = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

2. **Cruising Phase:**
   - **Speed:** 5 m/s
   - **Distance to cover at maximum speed (d₂):**
     \[ d₂ = \text{Total Height} - 2 \times d₁ \]
     \[ d₂ = 200 - 2 \times 12.5 = 200 - 25 = 175 \text{ meters} \]
   - **Time to cover cruising distance (t₂):**
     \[ t₂ = \frac{d₂}{v} \]
     \[ t₂ = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

3. **Deceleration Phase:**
   - **Deceleration:** 1 m/s²
   - **Time to decelerate to stop (t₃):**
     \[ t₃ = t₁ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
   - **Distance covered during deceleration (d₃):**
     \[ d₃ = d₁ = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Total Time:**

\[ \text{Total Time} = t₁ + t₂ + t₃ \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 \text{ seconds} \]

**Answer to Question 1:**

It takes **45 seconds** for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

### Question 2: Two People on the Same Lift

**Objective:** Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. Find the total time taken.

**Approach:**

1. **First Stop at 10/F:**
   - **Height to 10/F:**
     \[ \text{Height} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters} \]
   - **Time to reach 10/F:**
     - **Acceleration Phase:**
       \[ t₁ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
       \[ d₁ = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]
     - **Cruising Phase:**
       \[ d₂ = 50 - 2 \times 12.5 = 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ meters} \]
       \[ t₂ = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
     - **Deceleration Phase:**
       \[ t₃ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
     - **Total Time to 10/F:**
       \[ t_{\text{to 10/F}} = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ seconds} \]

2. **From 10/F to 30/F:**
   - **Height to 30/F:**
     \[ \text{Height} = 30 \times 5 = 150 \text{ meters} \]
   - **Time to reach 30/F:**
     - **Acceleration Phase:**
       \[ t₁ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
       \[ d₁ = 12.5 \text{ meters} \]
     - **Cruising Phase:**
       \[ d₂ = 150 - 2 \times 12.5 = 150 - 25 = 125 \text{ meters} \]
       \[ t₂ = \frac{125}{5} = 25 \text{ seconds} \]
     - **Deceleration Phase:**
       \[ t₃ = 5 \text{ seconds} \]
     - **Total Time to 30/F:**
       \[ t_{\text{to 30/F}} = 5 + 25 + 5 = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - **Time to 10/F:** 15 seconds
   - **Time from 10/F to 30/F:** 35 seconds
   - **Total Time:**
     \[ \text{Total Time} = 15 + 35 = 50 \text{ seconds} \]

**Answer to Question 2:**

It takes **50 seconds** for both people to reach their respective floors.

### Question 3: Minimum Time to 40/F with a Stop

**Objective:** Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

**Approach:**
