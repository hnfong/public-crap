Okay, let’s break down these problems step-by-step.

**1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the time it takes for a person to travel a distance equal to the height of the building.
*   **Formula:**  Time = Distance / Speed
*   **Distance:**  The height of the building is 40 stories * 5 meters/story = 200 meters.
*   **Speed:** The lift’s acceleration is 1 m/s².
*   **Calculation:** Time = 200 meters / 1 m/s² = 200 seconds.
*   **Answer:** It takes 200 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**2. How long does it take?**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the time it takes for two people to travel to different floors on the lift.
*   **First Person:** Goes to 10/F and 30/F.
    *   Distance = (10/F) * 5 meters + (30/F) * 5 meters = 50/F meters + 150/F meters = 200/F meters
    *   Time = 200/F seconds
*   **Second Person:** Doesn’t go to the same floor.
    *   Distance = 30/F * 5 meters + 10/F * 5 meters = 150/F meters + 50/F meters = 200/F meters
    *   Time = 200/F seconds
*   **Answer:** It takes 200/F seconds for each person to travel to their respective floors.

**3. What is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the minimum time it takes for the lift to reach 40/F, considering the possibility of stopping at another floor.
*   **Key Insight:** The lift *must* stop at a floor between 1/F and 40/F.  This is because the lift's maximum speed is 5 m/s.  If it doesn't stop, it will reach 40/F before it reaches 40/F.
*   **Calculating the Stopping Point:** The lift's maximum speed is 5 m/s.  The distance to 40/F is 40/F * 5 meters = 200/F meters.
*   **Time to Reach 40/F:** Time = Distance / Speed = (200/F) / 5 = 40/F seconds.
*   **Minimum Time:** The minimum time is achieved when the lift stops at the floor that is *closest* to 40/F.  Since the lift has to stop at another floor, the minimum time is 40/F seconds.

**Answers:**

1.  200 seconds
2.  200/F seconds
3.  40/F seconds [end of text]
