The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" refers to the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, specifically how the digits of the temperature values are related when converted between the two scales. 

To understand this, let's first recall the basic conversion formula between Celsius and Fahrenheit:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

where \( F \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \( C \) is the temperature in Celsius.

The statement suggests that if you take a temperature in Celsius, add 12°C, and then convert it to Fahrenheit, the resulting Fahrenheit temperature will have its digits inverted compared to the original Celsius temperature.

Let's test this with an example:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Original Celsius temperature: 12°C
   - Add 12°C: 12°C + 12°C = 24°C
   - Convert 24°C to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 43.2°F \)
   - The original Celsius temperature was 12, and the Fahrenheit temperature is approximately 43.2. The digits are not inverted, but this is because we added 12°C to the original temperature, not because of the conversion itself.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Original Celsius temperature: 23°C
   - Add 12°C: 23°C + 12°C = 35°C
   - Convert 35°C to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 35 + 32 = 95°F \)
   - The original Celsius temperature was 23, and the Fahrenheit temperature is 95. The digits are inverted (23 becomes 95).

This example shows that when you add 12°C to a Celsius temperature and then convert it to Fahrenheit, the resulting Fahrenheit temperature has its digits inverted compared to the original Celsius temperature.

However, it's important to note that this relationship is not a direct conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit but rather a specific property of adding 12°C to a Celsius temperature and then converting it to Fahrenheit. The general conversion formula between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complex and involves multiplying by 9/5 and adding 32. [end of text]
