Q1: 1 + 1 = **2**  
Q2: 6 × 7 = **42**  
Q3: 83 × 59 = **4897**  
Q4: 349 × 683 = **238,367**  
Q5: 6043 × 7489 = **45,258,527**  
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22  
Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15  
Divide by 3: x = **5**  
Q7: What is 25% of 80?  
25% = 0.25, so 0.25 × 80 = **20**  
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?  
Total given: 2 × $20 + $5 = $45  
Cost: $15  
Change: $45 - $15 = **$30**  
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.  
Perimeter = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = **20 units**  
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?  
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = **4 children**  
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1  
Follow order of operations (PEMDAS):  
12 ÷ 4 = 3  
Then: 3 + 3 - 1 = **5**  
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?  
This is ambiguous — it depends on how many slices per person. But assuming one slice per person (including Tom), and Tom is hosting, so total people = 5 guests + Tom = 6 people.  
So they need **6 slices** (assuming one per person).  
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?  
20% of $25 = 0.20 × 25 = $5  
Sale price = $25 - $5 = **$20**  
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?  
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM:  
3:45 → 6:45 is 3 hours = 180 minutes  
But we only go to 6:30, which is 15 minutes before 6:45  
So: 180 - 15 = **165 minutes**  
Alternatively:  
From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours = 180 minutes  
But we stop at 6:30, so subtract 15 minutes → 180 - 15 = **165 minutes**  
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?  
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5 → need to round up since you can't have half a taxi  
So **6 taxis** are needed  
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?  
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°  
So third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = **87 degrees** [end of text]
