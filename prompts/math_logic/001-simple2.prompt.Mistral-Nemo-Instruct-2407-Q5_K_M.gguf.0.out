Sure, let's break down each question:

**Q1: Significance and interesting properties of the number 120**

1. **Factorization**: 120 can be factorized into prime factors as 2^3 * 3 * 5. This means it's the product of 3 twos, 1 three, and 1 five.
2. **Divisibility**: 120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. It's a multiple of many numbers.
3. **Sum of divisors**: The sum of all divisors of 120 is 360 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 + 120 = 360).
4. **Perfect number**: 120 is a perfect number because the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) is equal to the number itself (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 120).
5. **Triangular number**: 120 is a triangular number, the 12th in the sequence of triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120...). It's the sum of the first 12 natural numbers.

**Q2: Solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

1. **Factoring**: The equation can be factored into (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.
2. **Setting each factor equal to zero**: This gives us two possible solutions: x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0.
3. **Solving for x**: From x - 9 = 0, we get x = 9. From x + 2 = 0, we get x = -2.
4. **Final answer**: The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: Number of round trips a train can make in a full day**

1. **Time to travel one way**: The train travels at 60 km/h, so the time to travel 200 km is 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes).
2. **Time for a round trip**: A round trip is 400 km, so the time is 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes).
3. **Time available in a day**: There are 24 hours in a day.
4. **Number of round trips**: The number of round trips the train can make is 24 hours / 6.67 hours/trip â‰ˆ 3.59 trips. Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips in a day.
