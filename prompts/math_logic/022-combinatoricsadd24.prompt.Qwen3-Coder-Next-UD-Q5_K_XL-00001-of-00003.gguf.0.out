Let's carefully try to find an expression using **exactly** the numbers **4, 3, 1, 8**, each **once**, to make **24**.

We'll follow your requested format with double/triple checking.

---

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16 → not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 * 3 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 → not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * 3 * (4 - 1) = 8 * 3 * 3 = 72 → too big. Retrying  
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24 ✅  
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 — exactly the given set. ✔️

✅ Final answer:

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Triple checking: 8 + 4 = 12, 3 - 1 = 2, 12 × 2 = 24. Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 — all used once.
