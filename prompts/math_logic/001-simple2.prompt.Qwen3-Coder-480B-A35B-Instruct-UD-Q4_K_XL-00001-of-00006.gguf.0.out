I'll answer each question step by step.

## Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**
The number 120 has several interesting mathematical properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
2. **Highly composite number**: It has many divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120) - 16 divisors in total
3. **Triangular number**: It's the 15th triangular number (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120)
4. **Sum of twin primes**: 120 = 59 + 61
5. **Base conversion**: In base 120, it's written as "10"
6. **Geometry**: The internal angles of a regular hexagon sum to 120 degrees each

## Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:**
I'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Given: a = 1, b = -7, c = -18

Step 1: Calculate the discriminant
Δ = b² - 4ac = (-7)² - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121

Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
x = [7 ± √121] / (2 × 1) = [7 ± 11] / 2

Step 3: Calculate both solutions
x₁ = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x₂ = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

**Answer: x = 9 or x = -2**

Verification:
- For x = 9: 9² - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 ✓
- For x = -2: (-2)² - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 ✓

## Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**
Let me calculate step by step:

Step 1: Calculate time for one-way trip
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours = 3⅓ hours = 3 hours 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate time for round trip
Round trip time = 2 × (3⅓ hours) = 6⅔ hours = 6 hours 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how many round trips in 24 hours
Number of round trips = 24 hours / (6⅔ hours) = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a partial round trip, it can complete **3 full round trips** in a day.

Step 4: Verification
3 round trips = 3 × 6⅔ hours = 20 hours
Remaining time = 24 - 20 = 4 hours
This remaining 4 hours is enough for one more one-way trip but not a complete round trip.

**Answer: 3 round trips** [end of text]
