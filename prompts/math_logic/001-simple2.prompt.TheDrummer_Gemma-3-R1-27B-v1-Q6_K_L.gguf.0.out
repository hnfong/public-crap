Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one with steps.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Significance:**

The number 120 holds significance in several areas, particularly in mathematics and measurement:

*   **Factorial:** It's 5! (5 factorial), meaning 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Factorials are fundamental in combinatorics (counting arrangements and combinations).
*   **Degrees in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.  120 is a common angle in geometry, especially in equilateral triangles (each angle is 60 degrees, and 120 is its supplement).
*   **Minutes in a Clock:** A clock face has 120 minutes in two hours.
*   **Units of Measurement:**  There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes.

**Interesting Properties:**

1.  **Highly Composite:** 120 has a large number of divisors (factors). Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.  Numbers with many divisors are called highly composite numbers.
2.  **Factorial:** As mentioned, it's 5! (5 factorial).
3.  **Divisibility:** It's divisible by many numbers (all its divisors listed above).
4.  **Sum of Divisors:** The sum of its divisors is 360.
5.  **Prime Factorization:** Its prime factorization is 2<sup>3</sup> * 3 * 5.
6.  **Geometric Significance:**  An exterior angle of a regular pentagon (5-sided polygon) is 72 degrees.  120 is 5 times 24, and 24 is 360/15 (15 sides).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Steps:**

1.  **Factoring:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. These numbers are -9 and +2.
    *   (-9) * (+2) = -18
    *   (-9) + (+2) = -7

2.  **Rewrite the equation:**
    x<sup>2</sup> - 9x + 2x - 18 = 0

3.  **Factor by grouping:**
    x(x - 9) + 2(x - 9) = 0

4.  **Factor out the common term (x - 9):**
    (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

5.  **Set each factor to zero and solve for x:**
    *   x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
    *   x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

**Solution:**
x = 9 or x = -2

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Steps:**

1.  **Calculate the time for one way:**
    Time = Distance / Speed
    Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours (approximately 3.33 hours)

2.  **Calculate the time for a round trip:**
    Round trip distance = 2 * 200 km = 400 km
    Round trip time = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours (approximately 6.67 hours)

3.  **Calculate the number of round trips in a day:**
    A full day has 24 hours.
    Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip
    Number of round trips = 24 hours / (20/3 hours) = 24 * (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

4.  **Since the train can only complete whole round trips:**
    The train can make 3 full round trips.

**Answer:** The train can make **3** round trips within a full day.
