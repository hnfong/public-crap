### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and historical significance:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, written as \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

2. **Triangular Number**: 120 is the 15th triangular number. A triangular number is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, so \(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 15 = 120\).

3. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

4. **Sum of Squares**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers: \(120 = 8^2 + 4^2\).

5. **Historical Significance**: In ancient times, 120 was used in various systems of measurement and counting. For example, in the Bible, the number 120 is mentioned in the context of the number of men who were with David in the wilderness (1 Chronicles 12:22).

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]

2. **Find the square root of the discriminant**:
   \[
   \sqrt{\Delta} = \sqrt{121} = 11
   \]

3. **Apply the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the two solutions**:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

**Final Answer**: The solutions to the equation are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. **Calculate the time for one trip**:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.\overline{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time for one round trip**:
   \[
   \text{Round Trip Time} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.\overline{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours)**:
   \[
   \text{Number of Round Trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/trip}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Final Answer**: The train can make 3 complete round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
