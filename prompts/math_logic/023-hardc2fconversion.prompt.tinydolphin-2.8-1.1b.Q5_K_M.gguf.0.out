 1. This means that the Celsius scale is inverted when dividing 12째C by 100, so the result will be Fahrenheit. This is helpful when you need to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

2. Inversely, when dividing Fahrenheit by 100, the result will be the original Celsius value. So, if we are given Fahrenheit 100 and want to convert it to Celsius, the conversion is 100째F = 100째C.<|im_end|>
