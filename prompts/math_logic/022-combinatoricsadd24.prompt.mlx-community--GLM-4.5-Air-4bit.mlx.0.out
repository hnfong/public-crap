Attempt: (8 / (1 - (3/4))) = (8 / (1/4)) = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (3 + (4 - 1)) = 8 * (3 + 3) = 8 * 6 = 48, too high. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, too low. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 * (4 - 1) = 24 * 3 = 72, way too high. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3/1)) = 8 * (4 - 3) = 8 * ```

Wait, let's try a different approach. How about using division to get a fraction that can multiply up to 24?

```
Attempt: (8 / (1/3)) * (4 - 1) = 24 * 3 = 72, too high. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) / (1 - (4/8)) = 24 / (1/2) = 48, too high. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * 8) - (3 * 1) = 32 - 3 = 29, not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1). Correct.
```

Final answer: `(4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 24`</think>```
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1). Correct.
```
