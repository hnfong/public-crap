Let's solve this step by step, using only the numbers **4, 3, 1, 8**, each exactly once.

We need an expression that evaluates to **24**.

Let’s try some combinations:

---

**Attempt 1**:  
Try multiplication first — 8 × 3 = 24. Then we have 4 and 1 left.  
We need to use them in a way that doesn’t change the value (e.g., ×1 or +0).  
Can we make 0 from 4 and 1? 4 − 4 = 0, but we only have one 4.  
4 − 1 = 3 → too much.  
1 − 4 = −3  
(4 − 1) = 3 → 8 × 3 + (1 − 4) = 24 − 3 = 21  
Not working.

---

**Attempt 2**:  
Try (8 − 1) × 3 = 7 × 3 = 21, then +4 = 25 → too much.  
(8 + 1) × 3 = 27, −4 = 23 → close.

---

**Attempt 3**:  
Try (4 + 8) × (3 − 1) = 12 × 2 = 24 ✅  
Let’s verify:  
- Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1 → all used exactly once.  
- Expression: (4 + 8) × (3 − 1) = 12 × 2 = 24

Double-checking:

```
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24 ✔️
Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1 — matches given (4, 3, 1, 8) ✔️
```

✅ Success!

Final answer:

```
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24 ✔️
Numbers used: 4, 8, 3, 1 — matches given (4, 3, 1, 8) ✔️
