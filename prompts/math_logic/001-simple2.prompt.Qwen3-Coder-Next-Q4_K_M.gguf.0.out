Let me solve each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting mathematical and real-world properties:

1. **Factorial number**:  
   $120 = 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$  
   So it's the factorial of 5.

2. **Highly composite number**:  
   It has many divisors:  
   Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 — total of **16 divisors**.

3. **Sum of consecutive integers**:  
   $120 = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 15$? Let's check:  
   Sum of first $n$ integers = $n(n+1)/2$.  
   Solve $n(n+1)/2 = 120$ → $n(n+1) = 240$  
   Try $n = 15$: $15 \times 16 = 240$ ✅  
   So $120 = 1 + 2 + \dots + 15$

4. **Sum of first 4 factorials**:  
   $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$ — not 120.  
   But $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! = 33 + 120 = 153$ — no.  
   Actually, $120 = 5!$, and also $120 = 3! \times 4! = 6 \times 20 = 120$ ✅

5. **Abundant number**:  
   Sum of proper divisors:  
   $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240 > 120$  
   So yes, it's abundant.

6. **Real-world significance**:  
   - In geometry: interior angles of a regular pentagon sum to $540^\circ$, but each interior angle is $108^\circ$ — not directly.  
   - In time: 120 seconds = 2 minutes; 120 minutes = 2 hours.  
   - In music: 120 BPM (beats per minute) is a common tempo.  
   - In religion: In the Bible, 120 years is the age limit Noah was given (Genesis 6:3), and Moses lived 120 years (Deuteronomy 34:7).  
   - In politics: The U.S. Senate has 100 members, but some state senates have 120 seats (e.g., Georgia, North Carolina historically had 120 in lower house).

So many interesting properties!

**Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$**

We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring, completing the square, or quadratic formula.

Let’s try factoring first.

We need two numbers that multiply to $-18$ and add to $-7$.

Try:  
- $-9$ and $+2$: $-9 \times 2 = -18$, $-9 + 2 = -7$ ✅

So we factor:  
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
$$

Set each factor to zero:  
- $x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9$  
- $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$

✅ **Solutions: $x = 9$ and $x = -2$**

(We can verify with quadratic formula:  
$x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}$  
→ $x = \frac{18}{2} = 9$, $x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$)

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Let’s break it down.

- Distance one way = 200 km  
- Round trip distance = $200 \times 2 = 400$ km  
- Speed = 60 km/h  
- Time for one round trip = distance / speed = $400 / 60 = 6.\overline{6}$ hours = $6$ hours $40$ minutes.

A full day = 24 hours.

Number of round trips = total time available / time per round trip  
= $24 \div \frac{400}{60} = 24 \times \frac{60}{400} = \frac{1440}{400} = 3.6$

Since the train can only complete **whole** round trips (partial trips don’t count), we take the integer part.

✅ **Answer: 3 round trips**

(Verification:  
- 1 round trip: 6h 40m  
- 2 round trips: 13h 20m  
- 3 round trips: 20h  
- 4 round trips: 26h 40m → exceeds 24h  
So only 3 full round trips in 24 hours.)

### Final Answers:

**Q1**: 120 = 5! = sum of first 15 integers, highly composite (16 divisors), abundant number, appears in time (2 hours), music (120 BPM), religion (Noah/Moses), etc.

**Q2**: $x = 9$ and $x = -2$

**Q3**: **3 round trips**
