We are given:

- Building: 40 floors
- Each floor: 5 meters tall → So height from ground to floor *n* is $ 5(n-1) $ meters? Wait: ground is 1/F, so going to 40/F means 39 intervals → total height = 39 × 5 = 195 m.
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Max speed: $ v_{\text{max}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $

The elevator motion has three phases:
1. Accelerate from rest to max speed (if distance allows)
2. Cruise at max speed (if distance is long enough)
3. Decelerate to rest at destination

But since max speed is low (5 m/s) and acceleration is 1 m/s², the distance needed to accelerate to max speed and decelerate is:

Time to reach max speed: $ t_a = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 $ seconds

Distance during acceleration: $ s_a = \frac{1}{2} a t_a^2 = 0.5 × 1 × 25 = 12.5 $ m

Similarly, deceleration from 5 m/s to 0 with $ a = -1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $ also takes 5 s and 12.5 m.

So total distance for acceleration + deceleration = 25 m.

If the total distance $ d \geq 25 $ m, then the elevator will:
- Accelerate for 12.5 m (5 s)
- Cruise at 5 m/s for $ d - 25 $ meters → time = $ \frac{d - 25}{5} $
- Decelerate for 12.5 m (5 s)

If $ d < 25 $ m, then it cannot reach max speed. It will accelerate for half the distance, then decelerate (symmetric triangular velocity profile).

### **Question 1: Ground (1/F) to Top (40/F)**

Distance: from floor 1 to 40 → 39 floors × 5 m = **195 m**

Since 195 > 25 m, it will accelerate, cruise, decelerate.

- Accelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s
- Decelerate: 12.5 m in 5 s
- Cruise distance: 195 - 25 = 170 m
- Cruise time: $ \frac{170}{5} = 34 $ s
- Total time: 5 + 34 + 5 = **44 seconds**

✅ **Answer 1: 44 seconds**

### **Question 2: Two people, ground → 10/F and 30/F**

So elevator goes: Ground (1/F) → 10/F → 30/F

We need total time from start until it stops at 30/F.

First leg: 1/F → 10/F

Distance: (10 - 1) × 5 = 9 × 5 = 45 m

45 > 25 → so:
- Acc: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Dec: 12.5 m, 5 s
- Cruise: 45 - 25 = 20 m → time = 20/5 = 4 s
- Time for first leg: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 s

But after stopping at 10/F, it must go to 30/F.

Now, from 10/F to 30/F: distance = (30 - 10) × 5 = 20 × 5 = 100 m

Again, 100 > 25 m → so:
- Accelerate: 5 s (12.5 m)
- Decelerate: 5 s (12.5 m)
- Cruise: 100 - 25 = 75 m → 75/5 = 15 s
- Time for second leg: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 s

But wait: when the elevator **starts from rest** at 10/F, it must accelerate again.

So total time = time to 10/F + time from 10/F to 30/F = 14 + 25 = **39 seconds**

But is there any overlap? No, because it stops at 10/F, then starts again.

So total: **39 seconds**

✅ **Answer 2: 39 seconds**

### **Question 3: One person to 40/F, second person gets off at another floor (not 40/F), minimize time to 40/F**

So: elevator starts at ground, must stop at **some intermediate floor** (say floor $ k $, $ 2 \leq k \leq 39 $), then go to 40/F.

We want the **minimum possible time** to reach 40/F, given it must stop at one intermediate floor.

So total journey: 1/F → k/F → 40/F

We need to choose $ k $ to minimize total time.

But note: stopping takes time? The problem doesn't specify door opening/closing or dwell time. So we assume **zero stop time** (only motion time matters).

So total time = time(1→k) + time(k→40)

Let’s define:

- $ d_1 = 5(k-1) $ m (1→k)
- $ d_2 = 5(40 - k) $ m (k→40)

Each segment may or may not reach max speed.

We want to minimize $ T = T(d_1) + T(d_2) $

Where for a distance $ d $:

- If $ d \geq 25 $ m: $ T(d) = 10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} $
- If $ d < 25 $ m: then it doesn’t reach max speed. Max speed reached is $ v_{\text{peak}} $ such that:
  - Accelerate for $ d/2 $, decelerate for $ d/2 $
  - Time to accelerate over $ d/2 $: $ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $ → $ t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}} = \sqrt{2s} $
  - So total time = $ 2 \times \sqrt{2 \times (d/2)} = 2 \times \sqrt{d} $

Wait: $ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $ → $ t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}} = \sqrt{2s} $ since $ a=1 $

So for distance $ d < 25 $: $ T(d) = 2 \times \sqrt{2 \times (d/2)} = 2 \times \sqrt{d} $

Wait: $ s = d/2 = 0.5 × 1 × t^2 $ → $ t = \sqrt{d} $

So accelerate time = $ \sqrt{d} $, decelerate time = $ \sqrt{d} $ → total $ T(d) = 2\sqrt{d} $

Yes.

So:
$$
T(d) = 
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{d} & \text{if } d \leq 25 \\
10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} & \text{if } d > 25
\end{cases}
$$

Now, $ d_1 =
