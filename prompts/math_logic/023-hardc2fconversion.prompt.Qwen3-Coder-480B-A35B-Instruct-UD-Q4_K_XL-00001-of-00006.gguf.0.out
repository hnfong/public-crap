Let me think through this carefully and provide a clear explanation with examples.

This mnemonic is suggesting a pattern for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit temperatures. Let me test what it means:

The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" means that when you go up by 12 degrees Celsius, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature has digits that are the reverse of the Celsius temperature.

Let me check some examples:

**Example 1: 0°C**
- Actual conversion: 0°C = 32°F
- The "inverted digits" of 0 would be... this doesn't work well with 0

**Example 2: 12°C**
- Actual conversion: 12°C = 53.6°F
- If we round to whole numbers: 54°F
- The digits 12 inverted would be 21
- 21 ≠ 54, so this doesn't match

Let me try a different interpretation. Maybe it's referring to specific landmark temperatures:

**Checking 12°C:**
- 12°C = 53.6°F ≈ 54°F
- Inverted digits of 12 = 21
- 54 is not 21

**Checking 21°C:**
- 21°C = 69.8°F ≈ 70°F
- Inverted digits of 21 = 12
- 70 is not 12

Actually, let me look for where this pattern might work:

**Checking 16°C:**
- 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F
- Inverted digits of 16 = 61
- This is very close! 61°F ≈ 61°F

**Checking 28°C:**
- 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F
- Inverted digits of 28 = 82
- Perfect match!

So the pattern seems to be: **At certain temperatures, if you invert the digits of the Celsius temperature, you get approximately the Fahrenheit temperature.**

Key examples:
- 16°C ≈ 61°F (16 inverted = 61)
- 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F (28 inverted = 82)

The "every 12°C" part might be referring to how this pattern occurs at intervals, but it's not a strict mathematical rule. It's more of a helpful coincidence that occurs at specific temperatures to help remember conversions. [end of text]
