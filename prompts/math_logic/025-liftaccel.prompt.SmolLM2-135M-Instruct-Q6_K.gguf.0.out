Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To find the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the person and then divide that distance by the acceleration.

Distance traveled = Height of the floor - Height of the ground
Distance traveled = 10 meters - 10 meters
Distance traveled = 0 meters

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to travel the distance:

Time = Distance / Acceleration
Time = 0 meters / 1 m/s^2
Time = 0 seconds

So, it will take the person 0 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. To find the minimum time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the person and then divide that distance by the acceleration.

Distance traveled = Height of the floor - Height of the ground
Distance traveled = 10 meters - 10 meters
Distance traveled = 0 meters

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to travel the distance:

Time = Distance / Acceleration
Time = 0 meters / 1 m/s^2
Time = 0 seconds

So, it will take the person 0 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

3. To find the minimum time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the person and then divide that distance by the acceleration.

Distance traveled = Height of the floor - Height of the ground
Distance traveled = 10 meters - 10 meters
Distance traveled = 0 meters

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to travel the distance:

Time = Distance / Acceleration
Time = 0 meters / 1 m/s^2
Time = 0 seconds

So, it will take the person 0 seconds to get from the ground floor to the top floor. [end of text]
