There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To find the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we can use the formula:

Time = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

The initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the lift starts from rest), the final velocity is 5 m/s (the maximum speed of the lift), and the acceleration is 1 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Time = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s^2
Time = 5 seconds

So it takes 5 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. To find the time it takes for two people to get to different floors, we need to calculate the time for each person separately and then add them together.

For the first person going to 10/F:

Time = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

The initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the lift starts from rest), the final velocity is 5 m/s (the maximum speed of the lift), and the acceleration is 1 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Time_1 = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s^2
Time_1 = 5 seconds

For the second person going to 30/F:

Time_2 = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

The initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the lift starts from rest), the final velocity is 5 m/s (the maximum speed of the lift), and the acceleration is 1 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Time_2 = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s^2
Time_2 = 5 seconds

Now, we add the two times together:

Total Time = Time_1 + Time_2
Total Time = 5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total Time = 10 seconds

So it takes 10 seconds for two people to get to different floors.

3. To find the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to calculate the time for each part of the journey and then add them together.

For the first part (from 1/F to 40/F):

Time_1 = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

The initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the lift starts from rest), the final velocity is 5 m/s (the maximum speed of the lift), and the acceleration is 1 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Time_1 = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s^2
Time_1 = 5 seconds

For the second part (from 40/F to the stop floor):

Since the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to calculate the time it takes to go from 40/F to the stop floor. Let's call this time t_2.

Time_2 = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Acceleration

The initial velocity is 5 m/s (the maximum speed of the lift), the final velocity is 0 m/s (since the lift stops), and the acceleration is -1 m/s^2 (negative because the lift is decelerating). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

t_2 = (0 m/s - 5 m/s) / -1 m/s^2
t_2 = 5 seconds

Now, we add the two times together:

Total Time = Time_1 + t_2
Total Time = 5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total Time = 10 seconds

So it takes 10 seconds for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F. [end of text]
