The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device that helps you convert between the two temperature scales. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

In the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water is 0°C and the boiling point is 100°C. In the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32°F and the boiling point is 212°F.

The statement suggests that you can convert between the two scales by comparing the temperatures in Celsius to the temperatures in Fahrenheit. Specifically, it says that every 12°C in Celsius corresponds to an inverted (i.e., flipped) 12°F in Fahrenheit.

To illustrate this, let's look at some examples:

- 0°C (freezing point of water) corresponds to 32°F (the freezing point of water in Fahrenheit)
- 12°C (the first 12°C point mentioned in the statement) corresponds to 54°F (12°F * 4.44, which is the conversion factor from Celsius to Fahrenheit)
- 24°C (the second 12°C point mentioned in the statement) corresponds to 92°F (24°C * 4.44)
- 36°C (the third 12°C point mentioned in the statement) corresponds to 156°F (36°C * 4.44)

As you can see, the digits are indeed inverted when you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. This mnemonic device can help you quickly and easily convert between the two temperature scales. [end of text]
