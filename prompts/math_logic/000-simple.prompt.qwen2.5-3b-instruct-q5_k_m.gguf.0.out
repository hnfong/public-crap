Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
Answer: First, we perform the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then we perform the addition and subtraction: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
Answer: Without knowing how many slices each guest will have, we can't determine the exact number of slices needed. However, if we assume each guest gets one slice, then 5 slices are needed.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
Answer: 20% off means the shirt is sold at 80% of its original price. So, the sale price is 25 * 0.8 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
Answer: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes. This is 165 minutes. Since we start at 45 minutes past 3:00, we subtract 45 minutes from 165 minutes, which gives us 120 minutes left.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
Answer: To find out how many taxis are needed, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of one taxi: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since we can't have half a taxi, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means 6 taxis are needed.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
Answer: The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
