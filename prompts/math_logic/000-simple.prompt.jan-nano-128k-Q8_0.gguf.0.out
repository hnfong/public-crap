Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I answer each correctly. Let me start with Q1.

Q1: 1+1=?
That's straightforward. 1 plus 1 is 2. I'm sure about that.

Q2: 6*7=?
6 multiplied by 7 is 42. Yep, that's right.

Q3: 83*59=?
Hmm, let me calculate that. 83 times 59. Maybe I can break it down. 80*59 is 4720, and 3*59 is 177. Adding them together: 4720 + 177 = 4897. Wait, is that correct? Let me check another way. 83*60 would be 4980, subtract 83 gives 4980 - 83 = 4897. Yes, that's the same. So the answer is 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?
This is a bigger multiplication. Let me try to compute it step by step. Maybe using the standard algorithm. Let's see:

First, multiply 349 by 600: 349*600 = 209,400.

Then 349*80 = 27,920.

Then 349*3 = 1,047.

Adding those together: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320; then 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367. Wait, but maybe I should check if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me verify with another approach. Alternatively, 349*683. Let me think of 349*683 as (350 - 1)*(680 + 3). But that might complicate. Alternatively, use calculator steps. Wait, but since I can't use a calculator, maybe I should check if my initial calculation is correct. Let me do 349*683 again. Let's break it down:

349 * 683 = 349*(600 + 80 + 3) = 349*600 + 349*80 + 349*3.

349*600: 349*6*100 = 2094*100 = 209,400.

349*80: 349*8*10 = 2792*10 = 27,920.

349*3: 1,047.

Adding them: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320. Then 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367. So I think that's correct. So answer is 238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
This is a huge multiplication. I need to be careful. Let me see if I can compute this. Maybe using the standard multiplication method. But this might take time. Alternatively, maybe approximate? Wait, but the question probably expects an exact answer. Let me try breaking it down.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. But that might not help here. Alternatively, note that 6043*7489 is a big number. Let me try to compute it step by step.

First, 6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000.

Then 6043 * 400 = 2,417,200.

Then 6043 * 80 = 483,440.

Then 6043 * 9 = 54,387.

Adding all these together: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200. Then 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640. Then 45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, maybe I should use another method. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 6043*7489 = (6000 + 43)*(7000 + 489). But that's even more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach, but since I can't, I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe I can check if the answer is correct by another way. Wait, but I think my initial breakdown is correct. Let me verify each part:

6043 * 7000: 6043 * 7 = 42,301, then times 1000 is 42,301,000. Correct.

6043 * 400: 6043 * 4 = 24,172, times 100 is 2,417,200. Correct.

6043 * 80: 6043 * 8 = 48,344, times 10 is 483,440. Correct.

6043 * 9: 6043 * 9 = 54,387. Correct.

Adding them all: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200. Then 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640. Then 45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027. So I think that's the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check with another method. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 6043*7489 = 6043*(7000 + 400 + 80 + 9) which is the same as above. So I think the answer is 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22.
Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15. Then divide by 3: x = 5. That's straightforward.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% is 1/4. 80 divided by 4 is 20. So answer is 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
So I paid with two $20 bills, which is $40. The book is $15, so the total amount due is $15. But the shopkeeper doesn't have exact change, so I need to give her more money. Wait, the problem says I give her an additional five dollar bill. So total money given is $40 + $5 = $45. The change should be $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think again. If the book is $15, and I give two $20 bills, that's $40. The shopkeeper needs to give me back $40 - $15 = $25. But she doesn't have exact change, so I give her an additional $5 bill. So total money given is $45. So the change is $45 - $15 = $30. Wait, but maybe the shopkeeper is supposed to give me back the change from the $40, but since she doesn't have exact change, I need to give her more money. Wait, maybe the correct way is that the shopkeeper needs to give me back $25, but she doesn't have that, so I give her $5 more, making the total amount I gave $45. Then the change is $45 - $15 = $30. So the answer is $30. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the shopkeeper is supposed to give me back the change from the $40, but since she can't, I give her $5 more, so the total change is $25 + $5 = $30. So yes, the answer is $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So 4*5 = 20 units. That's easy.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine is a girl, so she has two brothers and one sister. Wait, the sister is Katherine herself? Wait, the question says "two brothers and a sister." So Katherine has two brothers and one sister (which is someone else). So total children would be Katherine (1) + two brothers + one sister = 4. But wait, the sister could be Katherine's sister, so her mother has Katherine, her two brothers, and her sister. So that's 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 children. So answer is 4.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1.
Order of operations: division first. 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So answer is 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
Assuming each guest needs one slice, and Tom is also there, so total people is 5 guests + Tom = 6 people. So 6 slices. But the question says "they need," which might refer to the guests. Wait, the wording is ambiguous. If "they" refers to the guests, then 5 slices. If "they" includes Tom, then 6. But the question says "Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived." So the guests are 5, and Tom is the host. So the total number of people is 5 guests + Tom = 6. But the question is about how many slices they need. If the question is about the guests, then 5. If it's about everyone, then 6. But the problem says "they need," which could be the guests. But maybe the answer is 5. Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that each person needs a slice, including Tom. But the question is unclear. However, in many cases, when someone is holding a party, they might need a slice for themselves as well. But the question might be expecting just the guests. Hmm. Let me think again. The question says "5 guests have arrived." So the guests are 5, and Tom is the host. If the question is asking for the number of slices needed for the guests, then 5. If it's asking for the total number of people (including Tom), then 6. But the wording is "they need," where "they" is the guests. Wait, but the problem is in English, so maybe "they" refers to the guests. But maybe the answer is 5. However, sometimes people might assume that the host also needs a slice. But without more context, it's safer to assume that the guests are the ones needing slices. So answer is 5. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem is from a math textbook, and the answer is 5. But I need to check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where the host is not counted. So answer is 5.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
20% of 25 is 5. So 25 - 5 = 20. So the sale price is $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM. Let's calculate the time difference. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then subtract 15 minutes (since 6:30 is 15 minutes before 6:45). So 180 - 15 = 165 minutes. Alternatively, from 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours and 45 minutes. 2*60 + 45 = 120 + 45 = 165 minutes. So answer is 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
Divide 22 by 4. 4*5=20, so 5 taxis can carry 20 people, leaving 2 people. So need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis can carry 20, and the 6th taxi carries the remaining 2. So answer is 6.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So 31 + 62 = 93. Then 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. So the third angle is 87 degrees.
