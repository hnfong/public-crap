Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24, but uses 4 twice. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 1) - 3 = 8 * 3 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1) ✓
Triple checking: 8 + 4 = 12, 3 - 1 = 2, 12 * 2 = 24 ✓
