Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Q1: The number 120 represents a special type of "Twelve", which has a significant influence on many cultures around the world. It is often used as a symbol of unity and prosperity. The 120 is also significant in the context of the Chinese lunar calendar, which has a year of 12, and the Chinese New Year, which is celebrated every 12 years. It is used in many forms of Chinese culture, including art, literature, and music, to represent the cycle of life and the transition from one cycle to the next.

Q2: The equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) can be solved using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\). Here \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\). Plugging these values into the formula gives us \(\frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2-4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49+72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}\). This gives us two possible solutions: \(\frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9\) and \(\frac{7 - 11}{2} = -3\). Since we're interested in the positive solution, we take \(x = 9\).

Q3: It is not mentioned in the question how many trips the train can make in a full day, but based on the information provided, it is likely that the train travels for 12 hours in a day. Given that it travels at a speed of 60 km/h, we can calculate the distance it travels in a day as follows:

\[distance = speed \times time = 60 \times 12 = 720 \, km.\]

Subtracting the distance traveled in one day from the total distance to find out how many trips the train can make in a day:

\[number \, of \, trips = \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{720 \, km}{60 \, km/h} = 12 \, hours.\]

Since the train can only make one round trip in a day, we divide the number of trips by 2 to find out how many full days it can make:

\[number \, of \, full \, days = \frac{number \, of \, trips}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6\]

Therefore, the train can make 6 full days of trip between the two cities within a full day.
