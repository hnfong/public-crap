 [/INST] Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4877
Q4: 349*683=238407
Q5: 6043*7489=45293007
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, first subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20.
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you $5 in change.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children.
Q11: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we first divide 12 by 4 to get 3, then add 3 and 1 to get 4. So, 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 4.
Q12: Each guest needs one slice of birthday cake, so 5 slices are needed.
Q13: To find the sale price, first calculate 20% of $25, which is $5. Then subtract that amount from the original price: $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: There are 145 minutes from 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM (3 hours and 45 minutes = 205 minutes, and 6 hours and 30 minutes = 390 minutes, so 6:30 PM - 3:45 PM = 205 - 45 = 145 minutes).
Q15: To find the number of taxis needed, divide the number of people by the number of passengers each taxi can carry: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since a taxi cannot carry a fraction of a person, 6 taxis are needed.
Q16: The measure of the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
