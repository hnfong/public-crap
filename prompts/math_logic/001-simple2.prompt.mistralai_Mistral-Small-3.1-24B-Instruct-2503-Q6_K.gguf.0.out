Sure, let's tackle each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is significant in various contexts and has several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5!), which means \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

2. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

3. **Sum of Divisors**: The sum of the proper divisors of 120 (excluding itself) is 360, which is three times 120. This makes 120 a semiperfect number.

4. **Pentagonal Number**: 120 is the 10th pentagonal number, which means it can be represented as \( \frac{n(3n-1)}{2} \) for \( n = 10 \).

5. **Historical Significance**: In ancient times, 120 was considered a "complete number" because it is the smallest number with 16 divisors.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
\[ \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Substitute into the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \]
\[ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. Calculate the time taken for one trip from one city to the other:
\[ \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{200}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \]

2. Calculate the time taken for a round trip:
\[ \text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \]

3. Determine the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours):
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
