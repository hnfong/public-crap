Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Here's the attempt to construct a mathematical expression using the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) to get a result of 24, following the specified format:

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Triple checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24

**SUCCESS**

* Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8) - **CORRECT**
* Result: **24** - **CORRECT**
* Expression: **(8 + 4) * (3 - 1)**
```

Since the first attempt was successful, there's no need for retries in this case. The expression `(8 + 4) * (3 - 1)` correctly uses all the given numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) to yield the desired result of 24. [end of text]
