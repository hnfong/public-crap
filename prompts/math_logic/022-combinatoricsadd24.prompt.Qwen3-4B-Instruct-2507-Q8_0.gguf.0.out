Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) * (1 + 3) = (8 / 1) * 4 = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 8 * (3 + 1) - 4 = 8 * 4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying  
Attempt: 4 * 3 * (8 / (4)) = 12 * 2 = 24 → Wait, that uses 4 twice. Numbers: (4, 3, 8, 4) — invalid. Retrying  
Attempt: (8 - 4) * 3 + 1 = 4 * 3 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 → No  
Attempt: 8 * 3 = 24, then + (1 - 4) = 24 - 3 = 21 → No  
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24 ✅  

Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12; (3 - 1) = 2; 12 * 2 = 24.  
Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 — all exactly once.  
All numbers from the given set (4, 3, 1, 8) are used.  
Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication — all valid.  

✅ Final Answer:  
```
(8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
``` [end of text]
