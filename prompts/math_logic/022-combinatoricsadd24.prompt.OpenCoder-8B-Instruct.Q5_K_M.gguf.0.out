The problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem that can be solved using a brute force approach. The solution involves trying all possible combinations of the given numbers with the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to find a combination that results in the number 24.

Here is a Python code snippet that implements a recursive function to solve this problem:

```python
import operator
import itertools

def evaluate(expression):
    try:
        return expression()
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return float('inf')

def solve(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return numbers[0] == 24
    for a, b, op in itertools.product(numbers, repeat=2):
        for f in (operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv):
            if f is operator.truediv and b == 0:
                continue
            new_numbers = [a, b, f]
            if solve(new_numbers):
                return True
    return False

numbers = [4, 3, 1, 8]
if solve(numbers):
    print("24 can be obtained using the numbers", numbers)
else:
    print("24 cannot be obtained using the numbers", numbers)
```

This code uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of two numbers from the list. It then tries all four basic mathematical operations on these combinations. If the result is 24, the function returns `True`. If no combination of operations results in 24, the function returns `False`.

Please note that this code does not guarantee the optimal solution. It simply checks if 24 can be obtained using the given numbers. If you need the optimal solution, you would need to modify the code to keep track of the operations used and their order.
