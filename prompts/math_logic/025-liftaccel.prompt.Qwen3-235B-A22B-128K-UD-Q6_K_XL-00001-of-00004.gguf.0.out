Let's solve each question step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- A 40-story building.
- Each floor is **5 meters** tall.
- Elevator acceleration/deceleration: **1 m/s²**
- Maximum speed of elevator: **5 m/s**

---

### **1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

We are going from **1/F to 40/F**, so the elevator travels **39 floors**, each 5 meters.

So total distance:
$$
d = 39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
$$

The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, and finally decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at 40/F.

Let’s break the motion into 3 phases:

#### **Phase 1: Acceleration**
- Starts from rest: $ u = 0 $
- Acceleration: $ a = 1 \text{ m/s}^2 $
- Final speed: $ v = 5 \text{ m/s} $

Use the equation:
$$
v = u + at \Rightarrow 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \Rightarrow t = 5 \text{ seconds}
$$

Distance covered during acceleration:
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ meters}
$$

#### **Phase 2: Deceleration**
- Same as acceleration, but in reverse.
- Starts at 5 m/s, ends at 0 m/s.
- Time = 5 seconds
- Distance = 12.5 meters

#### **Phase 3: Constant speed**
- Total distance: 195 m
- Distance used in acceleration and deceleration: 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 m
- Remaining distance at constant speed: $ 195 - 25 = 170 \text{ m} $
- Speed = 5 m/s

Time at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \text{ seconds}
$$

#### **Total time:**
$$
t_{\text{total}} = 5 (\text{accel}) + 34 (\text{const}) + 5 (\text{decel}) = 44 \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ **Answer to Question 1: 44 seconds**

### **2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Now the elevator must stop at **10/F and 30/F**.

Let’s calculate the total distance and time for each segment:

#### **From 1/F to 10/F:**
- 9 floors = $ 9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ meters} $

We need to determine whether the elevator can reach its maximum speed in this distance.

- Distance to accelerate to 5 m/s: 12.5 m
- Distance to decelerate from 5 m/s: 12.5 m
- Total for acceleration + deceleration: 25 m

Since 45 m > 25 m, the elevator can **accelerate, reach max speed, and then decelerate**.

Let’s compute the time:

- Acceleration time: 5 s
- Deceleration time: 5 s
- Constant speed distance: $ 45 - 25 = 20 \text{ m} $
- Constant speed time: $ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ s} $

So time from 1/F to 10/F:
$$
t_1 = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \text{ seconds}
$$

#### **From 10/F to 30/F:**
- 20 floors = $ 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ meters} $

Again, check if it can reach max speed.

- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Total for acceleration + deceleration: 25 m
- Constant speed distance: $ 100 - 25 = 75 \text{ m} $
- Constant speed time: $ \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ s} $

Time from 10/F to 30/F:
$$
t_2 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \text{ seconds}
$$

#### **From 30/F to 40/F:**
- 10 floors = $ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ meters} $

Again, check if it can reach max speed.

- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Total for acceleration + deceleration: 25 m
- Constant speed distance: $ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ m} $
- Constant speed time: $ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ s} $

Time from 30/F to 40/F:
$$
t_3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ seconds}
$$

#### **Total time including stops:**

We must also account for **elevator stop time**. Typically, elevators stop for about **5 seconds per floor** (to open doors, let people in/out, etc.).

- Stops at 10/F and 30/F → 2 stops
- Stop time: $ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ seconds} $

So total time:
$$
t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \text{stop time} = 14 + 25 + 15 + 10 = 64 \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ **Answer to Question 2: 64 seconds**

### **3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

We are told the elevator must stop at **one other floor** (not 40/F), and we want to **minimize the total time** to reach 40/F.

We already know from Question 1 that **without any stops**, the time is **44 seconds**.

Now, we must **add the stop time** (5 seconds), but also account for the **extra distance and time** due to the elevator slowing down and speeding up again.

To minimize the total time, the elevator should stop at a floor **as close as possible to the top**, so that the elevator doesn't have to slow down and speed up over a long distance.

Let’s try stopping at **39/F** (just one floor below 40/F).

#### **From 1/F to 39/F:**
- 38 floors = $ 38 \times 5 = 190 \text{ meters} $

Check if elevator can reach max speed:

- Acceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Deceleration distance: 12.5 m
- Total for acceleration + deceleration: 25 m
- Constant speed distance: $ 190 - 25 = 165 \text{ m} $
- Constant speed time: $ \frac{165}{5} = 33 \text{ s} $

Time from 1/F to 39/F:
$$
t_1 = 5 (\text{accel}) + 33 (\text{const}) + 5 (\
