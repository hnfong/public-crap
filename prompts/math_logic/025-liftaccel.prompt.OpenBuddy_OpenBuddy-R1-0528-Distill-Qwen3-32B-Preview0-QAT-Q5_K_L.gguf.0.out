1. To calculate the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance.

First, let's find the total distance between the ground floor and the top floor:
Total distance = Number of floors * Height per floor
Total distance = 40 * 5 meters
Total distance = 200 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the maximum speed:
Time to reach max speed = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to reach max speed = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to reach max speed = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to reach max speed)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the remaining distance after reaching the maximum speed:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 200 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 187.5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:
Time at max speed = Remaining distance / Max speed
Time at max speed = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s
Time at max speed = 37.5 seconds

Finally, let's find the total time it takes to get from the ground floor to the top floor:
Total time = Time to reach max speed + Time at max speed
Total time = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds
Total time = 42.5 seconds

2. In this case, the lift will stop at the 10/F and 30/F floors. We need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to reach each floor and then add them together.

First, let's find the distance between the ground floor and the 10/F floor:
Distance to 10/F = Number of floors * Height per floor
Distance to 10/F = 10 * 5 meters
Distance to 10/F = 50 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 10/F floor:
Time to reach 10/F = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to reach 10/F = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to reach 10/F = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to reach max speed)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the remaining distance after reaching the maximum speed:
Remaining distance = Distance to 10/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 50 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 37.5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:
Time at max speed = Remaining distance / Max speed
Time at max speed = 37.5 meters / 5 m/s
Time at max speed = 7.5 seconds

Finally, let's find the total time it takes to get from the ground floor to the 10/F floor:
Total time to 10/F = Time to reach max speed + Time at max speed
Total time to 10/F = 5 seconds + 7.5 seconds
Total time to 10/F = 12.5 seconds

Now, let's find the distance between the 10/F and 30/F floors:
Distance between 10/F and 30/F = Number of floors * Height per floor
Distance between 10/F and 30/F = 20 * 5 meters
Distance between 10/F and 30/F = 100 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 30/F floor:
Time to reach 30/F = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to reach 30/F = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to reach 30/F = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to reach max speed)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the remaining distance after reaching the maximum speed:
Remaining distance = Distance between 10/F and 30/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 100 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 87.5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:
Time at max speed = Remaining distance / Max speed
Time at max speed = 87.5 meters / 5 m/s
Time at max speed = 17.5 seconds

Finally, let's find the total time it takes to get from the 10/F floor to the 30/F floor:
Total time to 30/F = Time to reach max speed + Time at max speed
Total time to 30/F = 5 seconds + 17.5 seconds
Total time to 30/F = 22.5 seconds

Now, let's find the total time it takes for both people to get to their respective floors:
Total time = Total time to 10/F + Total time to 30/F
Total time = 12.5 seconds + 22.5 seconds
Total time = 35 seconds

3. In this case, the lift will stop at the 40/F floor and another floor between 1/F and 40/F. We need to find the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40/F floor.

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the 40/F floor. In this case, the closest floor is the 39/F floor.

First, let's find the distance between the ground floor and the 39/F floor:
Distance to 39/F = Number of floors * Height per floor
Distance to 39/F = 39 * 5 meters
Distance to 39/F = 195 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 39/F floor:
Time to reach 39/F = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to reach 39/F = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to reach 39/F = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to reach max speed)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the remaining distance after reaching the maximum speed:
Remaining distance = Distance to 39/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 195 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = 182.5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at maximum speed:
Time at max speed = Remaining distance / Max speed
Time at max speed = 182.5 meters / 5 m/s
Time at max speed = 36.5 seconds

Finally, let's find the total time it takes to get from the ground floor to the 39/F floor:
Total time to 39/F = Time to reach max speed + Time at max speed
Total time to 39/F = 5 seconds + 36.5 seconds
Total time to 39/F = 41.5 seconds

Now, let's find the distance between the 39/F and 40/F floors:
Distance between 39/F and 40/F = Number of floors * Height per floor
Distance between 39/F and 40/F = 1 * 5 meters
Distance between 39/F and 40/F = 5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to reach the 40/F floor:
Time to reach 40/F = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to reach 40/F = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to reach 40/F = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to reach max speed)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during acceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the remaining distance after reaching the maximum speed:
Remaining distance = Distance between 39/F and 40/F - Distance covered during acceleration
Remaining distance = 5 meters - 12.5 meters
Remaining distance = -7.5 meters (This is not possible, so we need to adjust our calculation)

Since the lift cannot cover a negative distance, we need to adjust our calculation. The lift will decelerate to a stop at the 40/F floor. We need to find the time it takes to decelerate from the maximum speed to a stop:

Time to decelerate = (Max speed) / (Acceleration)
Time to decelerate = 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
Time to decelerate = 5 seconds

During this time, the lift covers a certain distance:
Distance covered during deceleration = 0.5 * Acceleration * (Time to decelerate)^2
Distance covered during deceleration = 0.5 * 1 m/s^2 * (5 seconds)^2
Distance covered during deceleration = 12.5 meters

Now, let's find the total time it takes to get from the 39/F floor to the 40/F floor:
Total time to 40/F = Time to reach max speed + Time to decelerate
Total time to 40/F = 5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total time to 40/F = 10 seconds

Finally, let's find the total time it takes for the lift to get to the 40/F floor, including the stop at the 39/F floor:
Total time = Total time to 39/F + Total time to 40/F
Total time = 41.5 seconds + 10 seconds
Total time = 51.5 seconds [end of text]
