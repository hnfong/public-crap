Below are the answers to each of your questions with steps where applicable.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:** The significance and interesting properties of the number 120 can vary across different contexts (mathematics, history, science, etc.). Since the context isn't specified, I'll provide a general overview with a lean towards mathematics and common references:

- **Mathematics:**
  - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It has 12 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120). *Correction: 120 actually has 16 divisors.*
  - **Factorial:** 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
  - **Geometry:** In a regular hexagon, the sum of the interior angles is 720 degrees, with each interior angle being 120 degrees.

- **Other Contexts:**
  - **Electronics:** 120 volts is a common standard for AC electricity in North American households.
  - **Time:** 120 minutes equal 2 hours.

**Interesting Property Steps (Math Focus):**
1. **List Divisors:** To see why 120 is highly composite, list all its divisors.
   - Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120
2. **Calculate 5!:** Verify 120 as 5!
   - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

**Answer:** The roots of the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Steps to Solve:**
1. **Quadratic Formula:** For an equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).
   - Here, a = 1, b = -7, c = -18
2. **Plug into Formula:**
   - x = [7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / (2*1)
   - x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2
   - x = [7 ± √121] / 2
   - x = [7 ± 11] / 2
3. **Solve for Both Values of x:**
   - x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
   - x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:** The train can make 2 round trips within a full day.

**Steps to Calculate:**
1. **Calculate Time for One Round Trip:**
   - Distance for one round trip = 200 km * 2 = 400 km
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 6.67 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes)
2. **Calculate Number of Round Trips in 24 Hours:**
   - Total hours in a day = 24 hours
   - Number of round trips = Total hours / Hours per round trip
   - Since 6.67 hours * 3 = 20.01 hours (which exceeds 24 hours for 3 full trips), the train can only complete 2 full round trips within 24 hours without considering the last incomplete trip.
   - **Calculation Correction for Clarity:**
     - 24 hours / 6.67 hours per trip ≈ 3.6 trips
     - Since you cannot make a fraction of a round trip in this context, the train can fully complete **2** round trips within the time frame, with time left over but not enough for a full third round trip.

**Clarified Answer for Q3 with Calculation Detail:**
Given the train can make approximately 3.6 round trips in 24 hours, but only **2 full round trips** can be completed within the day, as partial trips are not counted.
