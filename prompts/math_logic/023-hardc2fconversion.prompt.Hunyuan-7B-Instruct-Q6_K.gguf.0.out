This is a clever mnemonic to remember the conversion formula between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The rule states that for every 12 degrees increase in Celsius, the Fahrenheit value is obtained by "inverting" the digits of the Celsius value and adding 32.

### Explanation:
1. **"Inverting the digits"** means reversing the order of the digits in the Celsius number.
2. **Adding 32** accounts for the offset between the two temperature scales.

### Example 1:
- Convert **20°C** to Fahrenheit:
  1. Invert the digits of 20: **02** (which is 2).
  2. Add 32: $2 + 32 = 34$.
  3. So, $20°C = 34°F$.

### Example 2:
- Convert **100°C** to Fahrenheit:
  1. Invert the digits of 100: **001** (which is 1).
  2. Add 32: $1 + 32 = 33$.
  3. So, $100°C = 33°F$.

### Example 3:
- Convert **-10°C** to Fahrenheit:
  1. Invert the digits of -10: **0-1** (which is -1).
  2. Add 32: $-1 + 32 = 31$.
  3. So, $-10°C = 31°F$.

### Why does this work?
This mnemonic works because the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is nonlinear, and the "inversion" trick simplifies the process for quick mental math. However, it is not a perfect formula and works best for certain ranges of temperatures.
