This rule is a clever way to remember the conversion formula between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It states that for every 12 degrees increase in Celsius, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are reversed. This works because the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is based on a fixed ratio of 9/5, and 12 is a convenient number that aligns with this ratio.

### Explanation:
The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
$$

The rule "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" simplifies this process. Here's how it works:

1. **Find a base temperature**: Start with a known temperature where the Celsius and Fahrenheit values are easy to reverse. For example, 0°C is 32°F, and 12°C is 28°F. Notice that 12°C to 28°F involves reversing the digits (12 → 28).

2. **Adjust for every 12°C**: For every 12°C increase in the Celsius temperature, subtract 2 from the Fahrenheit temperature (since the digits are reversed). For example:
   - If the Celsius temperature increases by 12°C, the Fahrenheit temperature decreases by 2 (e.g., 12°C → 28°F, 24°C → 26°F, etc.).

3. **Reverse the digits**: Once you've adjusted for every 12°C, reverse the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature to get the final result.

### Example:
Let's convert 20°C to Fahrenheit using this rule:

1. Start with 20°C.
2. Subtract 2 from the Fahrenheit equivalent of 20°C. The Fahrenheit equivalent of 20°C is approximately 68°F (using the formula $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$). Subtract 2: $68 - 2 = 66$.
3. Reverse the digits of 66: $66 \to 66$.
4. The result is 66°F.

### Why does this work?
The rule works because the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is based on a fixed ratio of 9/5, and 12 is a convenient number that aligns with this ratio. By reversing the digits and adjusting for every 12°C, you can simplify the conversion process without needing to memorize the full formula.

### Another Example:
Convert 30°C to Fahrenheit:

1. Start with 30°C.
2. Subtract 2 from the Fahrenheit equivalent of 30°C. The Fahrenheit equivalent of 30°C is approximately 86°F (using the formula $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$). Subtract 2: $86 - 2 = 84$.
3. Reverse the digits of 84: $84 \to 48$.
4. The result is 48°F.

This method is a fun and creative way to remember the conversion formula!
