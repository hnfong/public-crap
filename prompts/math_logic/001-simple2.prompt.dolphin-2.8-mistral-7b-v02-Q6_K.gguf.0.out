Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
1. It is the product of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
2. It is a square number, because 120 = 3^2 * 4^2.
3. It is a triangular number, because 120 = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 20.
4. It is a hexagonal number, because 120 = 1 + 3 + 6 + ... + 12.
5. It is a pentagonal number, because 120 = 1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + 25.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.
x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x ≈ 3 or x ≈ -6.5

Q3: To find out how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we first need to determine how many hours are in a full day. We can do this by multiplying the number of hours in a day by the number of days in a year, and then dividing that number by 365 (since there are 365 days in a year).
Hours in a full day = (24 hours/day) * (365 days/year) / 365
Hours in a full day = 24 hours
Now, we can find out how many times the train can travel between the two cities in one full day by dividing the distance between the two cities (200 km) by the average speed of the train (60 km/h).
Trips in one day = 200 km / 60 km/h
Trips in one day ≈ 3.33
Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 round trips within a full day.<|im_end|>
