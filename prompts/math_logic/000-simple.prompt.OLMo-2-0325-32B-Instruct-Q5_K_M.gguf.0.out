Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the other two angles from 180 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees). So, 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. The measure of the third angle is 87 degrees. [end of text]
