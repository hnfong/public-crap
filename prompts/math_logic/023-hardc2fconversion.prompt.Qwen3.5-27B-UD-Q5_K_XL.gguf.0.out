The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted"** is a **mnemonic trick** (a memory aid) that works for a specific, limited set of numbers. It is **not** a universal mathematical rule for converting temperatures.

It relies on the fact that for certain specific temperatures, the digits of the Celsius value and the Fahrenheit value are the same numbers but in reverse order.

### How the Trick Works

The trick suggests that if you take a Celsius temperature where the digits are $A$ and $B$ (written as $AB$), and the Fahrenheit equivalent is $BA$, then the difference between these two temperatures is roughly related to the number 12.

However, the phrasing "every 12°C" is slightly misleading if taken literally as a repeating pattern. Instead, it refers to the **gap** between the specific pairs where this digit inversion happens.

Let's look at the actual math to see where this comes from.

The conversion formula is:
$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

We are looking for integer solutions where the digits of $C$ and $F$ are reversed.
Let $C = 10x + y$ and $F = 10y + x$.

Substituting into the formula:
$$10y + x = \frac{9}{5}(10x + y) + 32$$
$$10y + x = 18x + 1.8y + 32$$
$$8.2y - 17x = 32$$

Solving for integer values of $x$ and $y$ (where $x$ and $y$ are digits 0-9):
The only valid integer solution for standard temperature ranges is:
*   $x = 1$
*   $y = 6$

This gives us:
*   **Celsius:** $16^\circ\text{C}$
*   **Fahrenheit:** $61^\circ\text{F}$

Let's check the math:
$$F = (16 \times 1.8) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8 \approx 61$$
*(Note: It is an approximation. $16^\circ\text{C}$ is exactly $60.8^\circ\text{F}$, which rounds to $61$. The digit inversion is exact only if we round to the nearest whole number.)*

### Why the "Every 12°C" part?

The statement likely refers to the **difference** between the two numbers in the pair, or perhaps a confusion with another pattern.

1.  **The Difference:** $61 - 16 = 45$. This doesn't seem to relate to 12 directly.
2.  **The "12" Pattern:** There is a common, slightly different mnemonic that says: **"At $10^\circ\text{C}$, the digits are $50^\circ\text{F}$ (no inversion). At $16^\circ\text{C}$, it's $61^\circ\text{F}$ (inversion)."**
    *   The difference between $10^\circ\text{C}$ and $16^\circ\text{C}$ is **$6^\circ\text{C}$**.
    *   The difference between $50^\circ\text{F}$ and $61^\circ\text{F}$ is **$11^\circ\text{F}$**.

**Correction/Refinement of the Statement:**
The statement you provided is likely a misremembered or simplified version of a specific observation:
> "The only time the digits invert (roughly) is at **16°C** (which is **61°F**)."

There is **no** pattern where "every 12°C" the digits invert. If you add 12 to 16, you get 28°C.
*   $28^\circ\text{C} = (28 \times 1.8) + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4^\circ\text{F}$.
*   Digits of 28 are 2, 8. Digits of 82 are 8, 2.
*   **Wait!** $28^\circ\text{C}$ is approximately **$82^\circ\text{F}$**. The digits **are** inverted!

Let's check the next one. Add 12 to 28:
*   $28 + 12 = 40^\circ\text{C}$.
*   $40^\circ\text{C} = (40 \times 1.8) + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104^\circ\text{F}$.
*   Digits of 40 are 4, 0. Digits of 104 are 1, 0, 4. **No inversion.**

So the pattern breaks after two steps. The "Every 12°C" rule is **false** as a general rule, but it happens to work for the first two specific cases because of the linear nature of the conversion.

### The Correct Explanation with Examples

The statement is a **partial truth** that works for exactly two common integer temperatures where the digits reverse (with rounding).

**The Pattern:**
1.  **Start at $16^\circ\text{C}$**:
    *   Calculation: $16 \times 1.8 + 32 = 60.8 \approx \mathbf{61^\circ\text{F}}$.
    *   Digits: **16** becomes **61**. (Inverted).

2.  **Add 12°C to get $28^\circ\text{C}$**:
    *   Calculation: $28 \times 1.8 + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4 \approx \mathbf{82^\circ\text{F}}$.
    *   Digits: **28** becomes **82**. (Inverted).

3.  **Add 12°C again to get $40^\circ\text{C}$**:
    *   Calculation: $40 \times 1.8 + 32 = 104^\circ\text{F}$.
    *   Digits: **40** does **not** become **04**. The pattern fails here.

### Conclusion

The phrase means: **"There are two specific temperatures, 16°C and 28°C, which are 12 degrees apart, where the Celsius digits are the reverse of the Fahrenheit digits (when rounded)."**

It is **not** a rule that applies to every 12 degrees forever. It is a fun coincidence for two specific data points.

**Summary of Examples:**
*   **$16^\circ\text{C}$** $\rightarrow$ **$61^\circ\text{F}$** (Digits 1,6 become 6,1).
*   **$28^\circ\text{C}$** $\rightarrow$ **$82^\circ\text{F}$** (Digits 2,8 become 8,2).
*   **$40^\circ\text{C}$** $\rightarrow$ **$104^\circ\text{F}$** (Pattern breaks).

**Warning:** Do not use this as a general conversion method. For accurate conversions, always use the formula $F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$. [end of text]
