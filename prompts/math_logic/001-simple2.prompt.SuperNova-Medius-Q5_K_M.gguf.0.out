Let's address each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 is significant in several ways:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120). This means it's the product of all positive integers up to 5.

2. **Divisors**: 120 has many divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This makes it a highly composite number.

3. **Geometry**: In geometry, 120 is the number of degrees in a right angle (90°) plus the number of degrees in an acute angle (30°), which is significant in trigonometry.

4. **Time**: 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours, which is a common time interval in many contexts.

5. **Chemistry**: 120 is the atomic mass of the isotope Thorium-120.

6. **Music**: In music theory, 120 beats per minute (BPM) is a common tempo for many songs.

7. **History**: In ancient times, 120 was the number of elders in the Sanhedrin, a Jewish high court.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

1. Calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121.

2. Calculate the square root of the discriminant: sqrt(121) = 11.

3. Apply the quadratic formula:
   x = [7 ± 11] / 2

4. This gives us two solutions:
   x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
   x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip and then see how many of these fit into a full day.

1. Calculate the time for one way: 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes).

2. Calculate the time for a round trip:
   Round trip time = 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes).

3. Calculate the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours):
   Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours per round trip ≈ 3.6

Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, we round down to the nearest whole number.

So, the train can make 3 full round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
