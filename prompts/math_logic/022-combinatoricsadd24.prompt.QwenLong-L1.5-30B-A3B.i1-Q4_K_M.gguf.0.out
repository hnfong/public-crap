Okay, let's see. I need to make 24 using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8. Each number has to be used exactly once, right? So I can't repeat any numbers or leave any out. Let me think about different operations I can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Maybe parentheses to change the order of operations.

First, let me list out the numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8. Hmm. Let's try some combinations. Maybe start by multiplying some numbers to get close to 24. 24 is a multiple of 8, 3, 4, 6, 12, etc. Let's see.

If I take 8 and 3, 8*3 is 24. But then I still have 4 and 1 left. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers. So 8*3 is 24, but then I have to incorporate 4 and 1 somehow without changing the result. Maybe subtract and add them? Like 8*3*(4-4), but no, that would be zero. Wait, but I have to use 1. So maybe 8*3*(1) + (4-4), but that's still 24, but I'm using 4 twice. Wait, no, the numbers are 4,3,1,8. So each exactly once. So 8*3*1 + (4-4) is invalid because I can't use 4 twice. So that's not allowed.

Wait, maybe 8*3 is 24, but I need to use 4 and 1. So maybe 8*3*(something with 4 and 1 that equals 1). Like 8*3*(4/4) but that would be 24*1=24, but then I'm using 4 twice. Wait, no, the numbers are 4,3,1,8. So 4 and 1 are separate. So 4/1 is 4, but that's not helpful. Wait, 8*3*(4-3)? Wait, but 3 is already used. Wait, no, the numbers are 4,3,1,8. So if I do 8*3, that's using 8 and 3. Then I have 4 and 1 left. So maybe (8*3) + (4-1) = 24 + 3 = 27. Not 24. Or (8*3) - (4-1) = 24 - 3 = 21. Not 24.

How about 8*(something). Let's see. 8*3=24, but again, need to use 4 and 1. Maybe 8*(3 + (4-1))? Let's check: 4-1=3, so 3+3=6, 8*6=48. Too big. 8*(3 - (4-1)) = 8*(3-3)=0. No. 8*( (4-1) - 3 ) = 8*(3-3)=0. Not helpful.

What if I use division? Like 8/(1/3) is 24, but then I have 4 left. Wait, 1/3 is a fraction. Let's see: 8 divided by (1/3) is 24. But then I need to use the 4. So maybe 8/(1/3) * (4/4) = 24*1=24. But again, using 4 twice. Wait, but the numbers are 4,3,1,8. So 4 is only once. So 8/(1/3) would use 8,1,3, and then I have 4 left. So how to incorporate 4? Maybe 8/(1/3) - 4 + 4, but that's using 4 twice. Not allowed.

Wait, maybe (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4*4=16, which was the first attempt. That's not 24. So that's out.

How about 4*3*2=24, but I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe make a 2 from 8 and 1. Like 8/4=2, but then 4 is already used. Wait, let's see. If I do 8/(4) = 2, then 2*3*4=24, but that uses 4 twice. Wait, numbers are 4,3,1,8. So 8/4=2, then 2*3=6, then 6*4=24, but again, 4 is used twice. Not allowed.

Wait, maybe (8 - (4 - 3)) * something. Let's compute 4-3=1, so 8 -1=7. Then 7* something. 7* (1) is 7, not helpful. Wait, but I have 1 left. Wait, numbers used would be 8,4,3, so 1 is left. So 7*1=7. Not 24.

How about (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12*2=24. Wait, let's check that. 8+4=12, 3-1=2, 12*2=24. Oh! Wait, that uses all four numbers: 8,4,3,1. Let me verify. 8+4 is 12, 3-1 is 2, 12*2=24. Yes! So the expression would be (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Let me check if all numbers are used exactly once: 8,4,3,1. Yes, each is used once. So that should work.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute step by step. 8 + 4 = 12. 3 - 1 = 2. Then 12 * 2 = 24. Yep, that's correct. So why didn't I think of that earlier? Let me check if there's any other possible way, but this seems to work.

Wait, the problem says "construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24." So (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Let me confirm the numbers: 8,4,3,1. All used once. Perfect. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check if there are other possibilities, just to be thorough. Let's see. Another way: 8 * 3 * (4 - 3) * 1. Wait, 4-3=1, so 8*3*1*1=24. But that uses 3 twice? Wait, no: 8,3,4,3? Wait, no, 4-3 uses 4 and 3, so numbers used are 8,3,4,3? Wait, no, 4-3 uses 4 and 3, so the numbers used would be 8,3,4, and then 1 is left. Wait, no, the expression would be 8 * 3 * (4 - 3) * 1. Wait, but that's using 3 twice: once in 8*3 and once in (4-3). So that's invalid because we only have one 3. So that's not allowed.

Another idea: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 3 -1=2, so 8 -2=6, then 4*6=24. Let's check the numbers: 4,8,3,1. Yes, all used once. So 4*(8 - (3 - 1)) = 4*(8 - 2) = 4*6=24. That also works. Wait, so there are two possible expressions. Let me verify this one. 3-1=2, 8-2=6, 4*6=24. Yep, that's correct. So both (8+4)*(3-1) and 4*(8 - (3 -1)) work.

Wait, but the problem says "construct a mathematical expression," so either one is valid. Let me check if both are correct. Let's confirm the first one: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Correct. The second one: 4 * (8 - (3 - 1)) = 4 * (8 - 2) = 4 * 6 = 24. Correct. So both are valid. But the problem just asks for one, so either is fine.

Wait, but let me check if the problem requires using each number exactly once, which it does. So both expressions use each number once. So either is acceptable. Let me see if the problem has any specific constraints, but it just says "construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24" using the numbers (4,3,1,8). So either expression works.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, they tried some attempts and then the correct one. Let me check if the user's example had a mistake. The user's first attempt was (8 -4)*(3 +1)=16, which is wrong. Then they tried 8*3 +4 -1=27, which is wrong. Then 4*(8-3)+4=24, but that uses 4 twice. So the correct answer should be either (8+4)*(3-1) or 4*(8 - (3 -1)).

Wait, let me check the second one again: 4*(8 - (3 -1)). So 3-1 is 2, 8-2 is 6, 4*6 is 24. Yes. So that's correct. So both expressions are valid.

But the problem says "you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8)", so as long as each is used once, it's okay. So either expression is correct. Let me pick one. Let's go with (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) because it's simpler.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no other possible mistake. Let's compute (8 + 4) * (3 - 1). 8+4 is 12, 3-1 is 2, 12*2=24. Perfect. All numbers used once. So that's the answer.

Wait, but the problem says "double and triple check the result in the following format". So I need to present it as per the example. Let me see the example:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

So I need to present my attempt in the same way. So first, I need to write an attempt, then check it, and if it's correct, stop. So let's write:

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.

Wait, but the example had "Double checking: ... which is not 24. Retrying" and then another attempt. So in this case, since it's correct, I should just present the attempt and the double check as correct.

Wait, but the problem says "Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8)." So I need to make sure that in my attempt, I don't have any extra numbers or missing numbers.

So the correct attempt would be:

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24

Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct.

Therefore, that's the answer. Let me just confirm once more. 8+4 is 12, 3-1 is 2, 12 multiplied by 2 is 24. All numbers used exactly once. Yep, that's right. So that's the solution.

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24  
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1), which is correct. [end of text]
