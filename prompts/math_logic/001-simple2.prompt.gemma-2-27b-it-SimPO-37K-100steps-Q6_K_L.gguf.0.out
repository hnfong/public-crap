## Answers and Explanations:

**Q1: Significance and Properties of 120**

* **Significance:** 120 holds significance in various contexts:
    * **Factorial:** It's 5! (5 factorial), representing 5*4*3*2*1, highlighting its connection to permutations and combinations.
    * **Highly Composite Number:** It has more divisors (16) than any smaller positive integer. Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.
    * **Angular Measure:**  120 degrees is a key angle in equilateral triangles (each angle measures 60 degrees, and 120 is double that).

* **Interesting Properties:**
    * **Sum of Divisors:** The sum of its proper divisors (excluding 120 itself) equals 120, making it a **perfect number**.
    * **Triangular Number:** It's the sum of consecutive natural numbers from 1 to 15 (1+2+3...+15 = 120).

**Q2: Solving x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Method: Factoring**

1. **Find two numbers that add up to -7 (coefficient of x) and multiply to -18 (constant term).** These numbers are -9 and 2.
2. **Rewrite the equation:** (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
3. **Set each factor equal to zero and solve:**
    * x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
    * x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

**Solution: x = 9 or x = -2**

**Q3: Round Trips of the Train**

1. **Calculate one-way travel time:** Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours.
2. **Calculate round trip time:** 3.33 hours * 2 = 6.66 hours.
3. **Convert a full day to hours:** 24 hours.
4. **Determine the number of round trips:** 24 hours / 6.66 hours/trip ≈ **3.6 trips**.

**Since the train can't complete a partial trip, it can make 3 complete round trips within a day.** [end of text]
