### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step 1: Understand the number 120**
The number 120 is a well-known number in mathematics, often used in various contexts such as factorials, geometry, and time.

**Step 2: Factorization**
120 can be factored into prime factors as:
$$
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5
$$
This means it has 16 divisors (since the exponents of the prime factors are 3, 1, and 1, and we add 1 to each and multiply: (3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4×2×2 = 16).

**Step 3: Divisors of 120**
The divisors of 120 are:
$$
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120
$$

**Step 4: Use in mathematics**
- **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, i.e., $5! = 120$.
- **Time in hours**: 120 minutes is 2 hours.
- **Geometry**: 120 degrees is a common angle in geometry, often used in regular pentagons.
- **Clocks**: 120 minutes is 2 hours, so 120 minutes on a clock is 2 hours.
- **Music**: 120 beats per minute (BPM) is a common tempo in music.

**Step 5: Interesting properties**
- **120 is a highly composite number**: It has more divisors than any smaller number.
- **120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects** (5! = 120).
- **120 is the number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices** (K₅).

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$**

**Step 1: Identify the equation**
We have a quadratic equation:
$$
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
$$

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula**
The quadratic formula is:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
Here, $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = -18$.

**Step 3: Plug in the values**
$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
$$

**Step 4: Simplify the square root**
$$
\sqrt{121} = 11
$$

**Step 5: Solve for x**
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$

So the two solutions are:
$$
x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
$$
$$
x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
$$

**Final Answer:**
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step 1: Calculate the time for one one-way trip**
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.333 \text{ hours}
$$

**Step 2: Convert the full day to hours**
A full day is 24 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of one-way trips**
$$
\text{Number of one-way trips} = \frac{24}{\frac{10}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{10} = \frac{72}{10} = 7.2
$$

**Step 4: Calculate the number of round trips**
A round trip is 2 one-way trips, so:
$$
\text{Number of round trips} = \frac{7.2}{2} = 3.6
$$

**Step 5: Since the number of trips must be an integer, round down**
$$
\text{Number of round trips} = 3
$$

**Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{3}
$$
