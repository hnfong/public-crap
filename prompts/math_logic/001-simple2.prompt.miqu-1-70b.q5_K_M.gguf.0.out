Sure, I'd be happy to help answer these questions.

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
1. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any number smaller than it. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
2. It is the smallest number that is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 6.
3. It is a triangular number, as it can be represented as a triangle with dots (or balls). Specifically, it's the 8th triangular number, as 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 120.
4. It is a harmonic divisor number, meaning the number of divisors of 120 divided by the sum of the reciprocals of its divisors is an integer.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.
1. First, calculate the value under the square root, which is b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121.
2. Then, calculate the two possible values for x: x1 = [7 + sqrt(121)] / (2*1) = [7 + 11] / 2 = 8, and x2 = [7 - sqrt(121)] / (2*1) = [7 - 11] / 2 = -1.

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 8 and x = -1.

Q3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart, the time it takes to travel from one city to the other is distance/speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours or approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes. Since a round trip would take twice the time, one round trip would take 10/3 * 2 = 20/3 hours or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes.
Assuming the time stationed in the cities is negligible and there are 24 hours in a day, the number of round trips the train can make in a full day would be 24 hours / (20/3 hours) = 24 * 3/20 = 3.6. Since the train cannot make a partial round trip, the train can make 3 full round trips in a full day.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
