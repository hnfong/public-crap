 A1: The number 120 is significant in many ways and has several interesting properties. Here are a few:

1. It is a highly composite number: A number is considered highly composite if it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. 120 has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120), which makes it the smallest number with that many divisors.
2. It is a triangular number: Triangular numbers are formed by summing consecutive integers. The nth triangular number is given by the formula Tn = n(n+1)/2. The 8th triangular number is 120 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 120).
3. It is a harmonic divisor number: A harmonic divisor number is a positive integer with a harmonic mean of its divisors that is an integer. In the case of 120, its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. The harmonic mean of these divisors is an integer (12).
4. It is a tetrahedral number: Tetrahedral numbers are the sum of triangular numbers. The 5th tetrahedral number is 120 (1+3+6+10+15 = 120).

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, you can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this equation, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / (2*1)
x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
x = [7 + 11] / 2 or x = [7 - 11] / 2
x = 8 or x = -3

So the solutions to the equation are x = 8 and x = -3.

A3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart, the time it takes to travel between the cities is:

t = distance / speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours

Since the time spent stationed in the cities is negligible, the time it takes for a round trip is twice this time:

t_round_trip = 2 * (10/3) hours = 20/3 hours

In a full day (24 hours), the train can make:

number_of_trips = total_time / time_per_trip = 24 hours / (20/3) hours = 36/20 = 1.8 trips

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make 1 full round trip and part of another trip. Therefore, the train can make 1 complete round trip in a full day. [end of text]
