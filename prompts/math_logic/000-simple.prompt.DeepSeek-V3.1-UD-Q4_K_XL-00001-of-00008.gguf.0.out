Of course. Here are the answers to your questions:

**Q1: 1+1=?**
A1: 2

**Q2: 6*7=?**
A2: 42

**Q3: 83*59=?**
A3: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 4897.
(Calculation: 80*59=4720, 3*59=177, 4720+177=4897)

**Q4: 349*683=?**
A4: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 238,367.
(Calculation: 350*683 = 239,050, then subtract 1*683 = 683, so 239,050 - 683 = 238,367)

**Q5: 6043*7489=?**
A5: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 45,256,027.
(This is a very large multiplication. I would typically use a calculator for this level of precision.)

**Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.**
A6: x = 5
(Calculation: 3x + 7 = 22 -> 3x = 15 -> x = 5)

**Q7: What is 25% of 80?**
A7: 20
(Calculation: 80 * 0.25 = 20)

**Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?**
A8: $30
(Explanation: You initially gave $40 (2 x $20). You then gave an additional $5, so you have paid a total of $45. The book costs $15, so your change is $45 - $15 = $30.)

**Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.**
A9: 20 units
(Calculation: Perimeter of a square = 4 * side = 4 * 5 = 20)

**Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?**
A10: 4 children
(Explanation: Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children in total.)

**Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1**
A11: 5
(Calculation: Following PEMDAS/BODMAS: 12 รท 4 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6, then 6 - 1 = 5)

**Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?**
A12: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 6 slices.
(Assumption: This includes a slice for Tom himself, so 5 guests + 1 host = 6 people.)

**Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?**
A13: $20
(Calculation: Discount = $25 * 0.20 = $5. Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20)

**Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?**
A14: 165 minutes
(Calculation: From 3:45 PM to 6:45 PM would be 3 hours (180 minutes). We need to get to 6:30 PM, which is 15 minutes *before* 6:45. So, 180 minutes - 15 minutes = 165 minutes.)

**Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?**
A15: 6 taxis
(Calculation: 22 people / 4 people per taxi = 5.5. Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up to 6 taxis.)

**Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?**
A16: 87 degrees
(Calculation: The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.) [end of text]
