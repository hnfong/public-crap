Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

I'll do my best to answer all the questions.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then use the equation of motion to find the time.

Total distance = Number of floors × Height per floor
= 40 floors × 5 meters/floor
= 200 meters

Since the lift accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s², we can assume that it accelerates from 0 to 5 m/s, travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s, and then decelerates from 5 m/s to 0.

Let's break down the motion into three phases:

Phase 1: Acceleration (0 to 5 m/s)
Phase 2: Constant speed (5 m/s)
Phase 3: Deceleration (5 m/s to 0)

We can use the equation of motion to find the time for each phase:

Phase 1: Acceleration
v = u + at
5 = 0 + 1t
t = 5 seconds

Phase 2: Constant speed
Distance = Speed × Time
d = 5t
We need to find the distance traveled during this phase. Since the total distance is 200 meters, and the lift accelerates and decelerates over a distance of 25 meters (5 m/s × 5 s), the distance traveled at constant speed is:
d = 200 - 25 - 25 = 150 meters
t = d / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 seconds

Phase 3: Deceleration
v = u + at
0 = 5 - 1t
t = 5 seconds

Total time = Time for Phase 1 + Time for Phase 2 + Time for Phase 3
= 5 + 30 + 5
= 40 seconds

**Answer:** It takes 40 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

The lift will travel to the 10th floor, stop, and then continue to the 30th floor.

Distance to 10th floor = 10 floors × 5 meters/floor = 50 meters
Distance from 10th floor to 30th floor = 20 floors × 5 meters/floor = 100 meters

We can use the same equation of motion as before to find the time for each phase:

Phase 1: Acceleration (0 to 5 m/s)
t = 5 seconds

Phase 2: Constant speed (5 m/s) to 10th floor
Distance = Speed × Time
d = 5t
50 = 5t
t = 10 seconds

Phase 3: Deceleration (5 m/s to 0) at 10th floor
t = 5 seconds

Phase 4: Acceleration (0 to 5 m/s) from 10th floor
t = 5 seconds

Phase 5: Constant speed (5 m/s) from 10th floor to 30th floor
Distance = Speed × Time
d = 5t
100 = 5t
t = 20 seconds

Phase 6: Deceleration (5 m/s to 0) at 30th floor
t = 5 seconds

Total time = Time for Phase 1 + Time for Phase 2 + Time for Phase 3 + Time for Phase 4 + Time for Phase 5 + Time for Phase 6
= 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 5
= 50 seconds

**Answer:** It takes 50 seconds for the lift to travel from the ground floor to the 10th floor and then to the 30th floor.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the 40th floor, which is the 39th floor.

Distance to 39th floor = 39 floors × 5 meters/floor = 195 meters
Distance from 39th floor to 40th floor = 1 floor × 5 meters/floor = 5 meters

We can use the same equation of motion as before to find the time for each phase:

Phase 1: Acceleration (0 to 5 m/s)
t = 5 seconds

Phase 2: Constant speed (5 m/s) to 39th floor
Distance = Speed × Time
d = 5t
195 = 5t
t = 39 seconds

Phase 3: Deceleration (5 m/s to 0) at 39th floor
t = 5 seconds

Phase 4: Acceleration (0 to 5 m/s) from 39th floor
t = 5 seconds

Phase 5: Constant speed (5 m/s) from 39th floor to 40th floor
Distance = Speed × Time
d = 5t
5 = 5t
t = 1 second

Phase 6: Deceleration (5 m/s to 0) at 40th floor
t = 5 seconds

Total time = Time for Phase 1 + Time for Phase 2 + Time for Phase 3 + Time for Phase 4 + Time for Phase 5 + Time for Phase 6
= 5 + 39 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5
= 60 seconds

**Answer:** The minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 60 seconds. [end of text]
