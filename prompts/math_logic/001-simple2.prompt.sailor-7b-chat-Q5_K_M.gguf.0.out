Q1: Some interesting properties of the number 120 include:

- It is a multiple of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15.
- It is also a multiple of 100.
- It is a composite number, which means it has more than two divisors.
- The sum of its digits is 1.
- The sum of the digits of its prime factorization is 12.
- It is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits.

Q2: The equation is x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, which can be solved by factoring or completing the square. The factored form is (x - 6)(x + 3) = 0, and the completed square is (x - 3)^2 = 9. The solutions are x = 6 and x = -3.

Q3: The train can make 4 round trips within a full day. This is because the distance between the two cities is 200 km, and each round trip covers half of the distance. Therefore, the train travels a total distance of 200 km/2 = 100 km in each round trip. With a speed of 60 km/h, the train takes 100/60 = 1.66 hours to complete each round trip. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the train can complete 24/1.66 = 14.5 round trips in a day. However, since 1.5 is not an integer, we round up to 15, and then subtract 1 for the first trip, giving us a total of 4 round trips.<|im_end|>
