We are given a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. So building height = 40 * 5 = 200 m. But careful: ground floor is 1/F, top floor is 40/F. But note: ground floor is 1/F, so the building floors are numbered 1 to 40. But the building height is 40 floors * 5 m = 200 m. But wait: if ground floor is 1/F, then the top floor is 40/F, so the vertical distance from ground floor to top floor is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m? Let's check: if ground floor is 1/F, then floor 2 is 5 m above ground floor, floor 3 is 10 m above ground floor, etc. But then floor 40 is 39 floors above ground floor, so height = 39 * 5 = 195 m. But the problem statement says "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." It might be ambiguous: if ground floor is counted as floor 1, then the building has 40 floors, and the top floor is 40/F, so the vertical distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. But sometimes building floors are counted as 0 to 39. But the problem says "ground floor (1/F)" so it's likely that the ground floor is floor 1, and then floors 2 to 40. But then the vertical distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. But then the question "How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?" might be computed as the time for the elevator to travel 195 m. But then the elevator acceleration is 1 m/s^2, maximum speed is 5 m/s. But wait: the elevator's acceleration is 1 m/s^2, deceleration is 1 m/s^2, maximum speed is 5 m/s. So the elevator's motion is like a trapezoidal velocity profile. But the distance is 195 m. But wait: the problem statement "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." might be interpreted as the building has 40 floors, each floor is 5 m tall, so the total height is 40*5 = 200 m. But then ground floor is 1/F, top floor is 40/F, so the vertical distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. But then the question "How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?" might be computed as the time for the elevator to travel 195 m. But then the elevator's acceleration is 1 m/s^2, maximum speed is 5 m/s, deceleration is 1 m/s^2. But then the elevator's motion is like a trapezoidal velocity profile. But we need to check if the elevator can reach maximum speed. Let's compute the distance required to accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s with acceleration 1 m/s^2. That distance is (v^2)/(2a) = (5^2)/(2*1) = 25/2 = 12.5 m. Similarly, deceleration distance is also 12.5 m. So total distance for acceleration and deceleration phases is 25 m. Then the remaining distance is 195 - 25 = 170 m. But if the elevator can travel at maximum speed for that distance, then the time at maximum speed is distance / speed = 170/5 = 34 s. And the acceleration time is 5 s (since v = 5 m/s, acceleration 1 m/s^2, so time = 5 s) and deceleration time is also 5 s. So total time = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 s. But wait: check if the elevator can reach maximum speed. But wait: if the distance is 195 m, then the maximum speed is reached if the distance is greater than 25 m. But 195 m is greater than 25 m, so yes. But wait: but the elevator might not be able to reach maximum speed if the distance is too short. But here it is long enough. But wait: but the building is 40 stories tall, but the distance is 195 m. But then the answer for question 1 is 44 s. But wait: but the problem statement "There is a 40 story building" might be interpreted as the building has 40 floors, but the distance from ground floor to top floor is 40 floors * 5 m = 200 m. But then the ground floor is 1/F, so the top floor is 40/F, so the vertical distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. But then the answer is 44 s. But let me check: if the building is 40 stories tall, then the top floor is 40/F, but the ground floor is 1/F, so the number of intervals is 39. But the problem statement "Each floor is 5 meters tall" might be interpreted as the distance between floors is 5 m. So the distance from ground floor to top floor is 39*5 = 195 m. But then the answer is 44 s. But wait: but the problem statement "There is a 40 story building" might be interpreted as there are 40 floors including the ground floor, so the top floor is 40/F, and the distance is 40*5 = 200 m. But then the distance from ground floor to top floor is 200 m if we assume ground floor is at 0 m and top floor is at 200 m. But then the acceleration distance is 12.5 m each, so total is 25 m, leaving 175 m at constant speed, which takes 35 s, plus 10 s acceleration/deceleration, total 45 s. But which is correct? Let's re-read the problem: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." It says ground floor is 1/F, top floor is 40/F. So the floors are numbered 1 to 40. So the vertical distance from floor 1 to floor 40 is 39 intervals * 5 m = 195 m. But sometimes people say "40 story building" meaning there are 40 floors above ground. But then the ground floor is not counted as a story. But then the top floor is 40/F, so the distance is 40*5 = 200 m. But then the problem statement "1/F" is ambiguous. But I'll assume that the ground floor is floor 1, so the distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. But then the answer for question 1 is 44 s. But let me check: acceleration distance = (5^2)/(2*1) = 12.5 m, deceleration distance = 12.5 m, so total distance for acceleration and deceleration = 25 m. Then constant speed distance = 195 - 25 = 170 m, time at constant speed = 170/5 = 34 s, acceleration time = 5 s, deceleration time = 5 s, total = 5+34+5 = 44 s. So answer for question 1: 44 seconds.

But wait: But if the building is 40 stories tall, then the distance might be 200 m if we assume ground floor is at 0 m and top floor is at 200 m. But then the distance between floors is 200/40 = 5 m, but then the ground floor is 0 m and top floor is 200 m, but then the problem says ground floor is 1/F, so maybe floor 1 is at 0 m? But then floor 40 is at 195 m. But then the distance is 195 m. But then the answer is 44 s. But let me check: if the building is 40 stories tall, then there are 40 floors, but the ground floor is 1/F, so the top floor is 40/F, so the vertical distance is 39 floors * 5 m = 195 m. So answer is 44 s.

I'll assume that the distance is 195 m.

However, I'll check the possibility: maybe the building
