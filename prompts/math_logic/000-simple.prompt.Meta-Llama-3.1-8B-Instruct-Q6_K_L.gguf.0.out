Here are the answers to the questions:

Q1: 1+1= 2

Q2: 6*7= 42

Q3: 83*59= 4897

Q4: 349*683= 238427

Q5: 6043*7489= 45211147

Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we need to isolate x. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then, divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 x 80 = 20.

Q8: You gave the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, which is $40. The book costs $15, so the shopkeeper owes you $25. You gave her an additional $5, so the total amount you paid is $45. The shopkeeper should give you a change of $20.

Q9: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides are equal, the perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 units.

Q10: The question asks how many children Katherine's mother has, but it doesn't mention Katherine's mother's children. It only mentions Katherine's siblings. So, we can't determine the answer based on the information given.

Q11: To evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, divide 12 by 4: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then, add 3: 3 + 3 = 6. Finally, subtract 1: 6 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Since there are 5 guests, they need 5 slices of birthday cake.

Q13: To find the sale price, calculate 20% of the original price: 0.20 x $25 = $5. Then, subtract the discount from the original price: $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: To find the number of minutes left until 6:30 PM, we need to subtract the current time from the target time. 6:30 PM - 3:45 PM = 2 hours and 45 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Add the remaining 45 minutes: 120 + 45 = 165 minutes.

Q15: To find the number of taxis needed, divide the total number of people by the capacity of each taxi: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a taxi, you need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, you need 6 taxis.

Q16: The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We know two angles measure 31 and 62 degrees. Let's call the third angle x. Then, 31 + 62 + x = 180. Subtract 93 from both sides: x = 87.
