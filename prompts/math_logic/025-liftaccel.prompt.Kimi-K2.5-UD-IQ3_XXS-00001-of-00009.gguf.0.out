I need to solve these elevator problems step by step.

First, let me establish some basics:
- Each floor is 5m tall
- Ground floor (1/F) is at height 0
- Top floor (40/F) is at height 39 × 5 = 195m (since 1/F to 2/F is one floor height)
- Actually, let me reconsider: 1/F to 40/F is 39 intervals, so 39 × 5 = 195m

Wait - let me re-read. "Ground floor (1/F)" suggests 1/F is at ground level. So:
- 1/F height = 0
- 2/F height = 5m
- 40/F height = 39 × 5 = 195m

Acceleration a = 1 m/s², max speed v_max = 5 m/s

## Key Kinematics

Time to reach max speed: t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds
Distance during acceleration: d = ½at² = ½ × 1 × 25 = 12.5 m

Same for deceleration.

## Question 1: Ground floor to top floor (0 to 195m)

Total distance = 195m

Distance for accel + decel = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25m

Since 25m < 195m, the elevator reaches max speed.

Cruising distance = 195 - 25 = 170m
Cruising time = 170/5 = 34 seconds

Total time = 5 + 34 + 5 = **44 seconds**

---

## Question 2: Stop at 10/F then continue to 30/F

**Leg 1: 1/F to 10/F**
Height: 0 to 9×5 = 45m, so distance = 45m

Since 45m > 25m, reaches max speed.
Cruising distance = 45 - 25 = 20m
Cruising time = 20/5 = 4s
Leg 1 time = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 seconds

**Leg 2: 10/F to 30/F**
Height: 45m to 29×5 = 145m, distance = 100m

Reaches max speed.
Cruising distance = 100 - 25 = 75m
Cruising time = 75/5 = 15s
Leg 2 time = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds

**Total time = 14 + 25 = 39 seconds**

---

## Question 3: Stop at one floor between 1/F and 40/F, minimize time to 40/F

We need to stop at some floor k (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 39), then continue to 40/F.

Total distance is fixed at 195m. The question is: where to stop to minimize total time?

Key insight: The elevator must decelerate to stop at floor k, then accelerate again. This "stop" costs extra time compared to cruising through.

For a stop at floor k: height = (k-1)×5 meters from ground.

Let me think about this more carefully. The total path is:
- 1/F → k/F → 40/F

For any intermediate stop, we have:
- Accelerate from 0, cruise, decelerate to 0 at k/F
- Accelerate from 0, cruise, decelerate to 0 at 40/F

The time depends on whether max speed is reached in each segment.

**Strategy: Make the segments as long as possible to minimize time**

Actually, let me think about this differently. For a fixed total distance with one forced stop, when is time minimized?

For each segment, if distance ≥ 25m, we reach max speed and time = 10 + (d-25)/5 = (d+25)/5? No wait:
Time = 5 + (d-25)/5 + 5 = 10 + d/5 - 5 = 5 + d/5

If d ≥ 25m: time = 10 + (d-25)/5 = 5 + d/5 seconds? Let me check: 5 + 20/5 + 5 = 14, and 5 + 45/5 = 14. ✓

If d < 25m: doesn't reach max speed. Time = 2 × √(2d/a) = 2√(2d) since it accelerates then immediately decelerates.

For d < 25: time = 2√(2d) (since t_accel = √(2d/a) = √(2d), and same for decel, but they overlap... wait)

Actually for short distances: accelerate for time t, reach speed v=at, distance d = ½at² + (vt - ½at²) with deceleration... 

For symmetric accel/decel with no cruising: d = 2 × ½ × a × (t/2)²? No, better: time t_total, accel for t₁, decel for t₂ where t₁ = t₂ = t_total/2 if symmetric.

Distance = 2 × ½ × a × (t/2)² = a(t/2)² = at²/4, so t = 2√(d/a) = 2√d.

For d = 25m: t = 2√25 = 10s, but we said 10s for accel+decel. Actually 5+5=10. ✓

So for d < 25m: time = 2√(2d)? Let me verify: if d=12.5, time should be 5+5=10? No, that's wrong.

Let me recalculate: For d = 12.5m (just accel to max speed then immediately decel):
- accel 12.5m takes 5s, reaches 5m/s
- decel 12.5m takes 5s

Total 10s. Formula 2√(2×12.5) = 2√25 = 10. ✓

For d = 5m (one floor): time = 2√10 ≈ 6.32s

Back to optimization: We want to minimize total time for 1/F → k/F → 40/F.

Distance to k/F: d₁ = 5(k-1)
Distance k/F to 40/F: d₂ = 5(40-k) = 200 - 5k? No wait: 40/F is at 195m, k/F is at 5(k-1)m.

d₂ = 195 - 5(k-1) = 195 - 5k + 5 = 200 - 5k? Let me check: k=40, d₂=0. k=2, d₂=190. 

Actually 40/F to k/F where k<40: distance = 195 - 5(k-1) = 200 - 5k? For k=2: 200-10=190, but should be 195-5=190. ✓

So d₁ = 5(k-1), d₂ = 195 - 5(k-1) = 200 - 5k? = 5(40-k) + something... = 5(39 - (k-1)) = 5(40-k).

Wait: 195 = 5×39. So d₂ = 5×39 - 5(k-1) = 5(39-k+1) = 5(40-k). ✓

So d₁ + d₂ = 5(k-1) + 5(40-k) = 5k - 5 + 200 - 5k = 195. ✓

Now, d₁ = 5(k-1), d₂ = 5(40-k) = 200-5k-5? = 195-5(k-1).

For k from 2 to 39: d₁ ranges 5 to 190, d₂ ranges 190 to 5.

Both are > 25m for most values. d₁ < 25 when k-1 < 5, so k ≤ 5. d₂ < 25 when 40-k < 5, so k > 35.

**Case: Both segments ≥ 25m (i.e., 6 ≤ k ≤ 35)**

Time = (5 + d₁/5) + (5 + d₂/5) = 10 + (d₁+d₂)/5 = 10 + 195/5 = 10 + 39 = 49 seconds? 

Wait: earlier formula was 5 + d/5 for d≥25? Check: d=45, time=14, and 5+9=14. ✓

So time = 10 + 195/5 = 49 seconds for any k in [6,35].

**Case: k = 2,3,4,5 (d₁ < 25, d₂ > 25)**

Time = 2√(2d₁) + 5 + d₂/5 = 2√(10(k-1)) + 5 + (195-5(k-1))/5 = 2√(10(k-1)) + 5 + 39 - (k-1)

= 2√(10(k-1)) + 44 - (k-1)

For k=5: d₁=20, time = 2√40 + 44 - 4 = 2×6.32 + 40 = 52.6s

For k=2: d₁=5, time = 2√10 + 44 - 1 = 6.32 + 43 = 49.3s

**Case: k = 36,37,38,39 (d₁ > 25, d₂ < 25)**

By symmetry, same times as k=5,4,3,2.

For k=36: d₂=20, time = 5 + d₁/5 + 2√(2d₂) = 5 + 175/5 + 2√40 = 5 + 35 + 12.65 = 52.65s

Minimum is at k=2 or k=39, with time ≈ 49.3s, or in the middle range 49s.

Actually 49 < 49.3, so minimum is **49 seconds** achieved for any k from 6 to 35.

But wait, I need to check if the problem wants the minimum. Let me recheck k=2:
d₁ = 5, d₂ = 190
Time = 2√10 + 5 + 190/5 = 6.325 + 5 + 38 = 49.325s

k=6: d₁=25, time = 5+5+5 + 5+170/5+5 = 10+5 + 10+34 = wait let me use formula: 5+25/5 + 5+170/5 = 5+5+5+34+5 = 10+39 = 49? 

Actually: 5 + 5 + 5 + 34 + 5 = 54? No: first leg: accel 5s, cruise 0s (since d=25 exactly), decel 5s = 10s. Second leg: 5 + 34 + 5 = 44s. Total 54s?

Let me recalculate: For d=25, time = 5+0+5 = 10s using the structure, or 5+25/5 = 10. ✓

For d=170: time = 5 + 170/5 + 5? No that's wrong. Time = 5 + (170-25)/5 + 5? No, cruising is at max speed.

Time = accel_time + cruise_time + decel_time = 5 + (170-25)/5? Wait distance for accel+decel is 25, so cruising is 170-25=145? No d=170.

Cruising distance = 170 - 25 = 145? But 170 > 25, so yes. Cruise time = 145/5 = 29. Total = 5+29+5 = 39.

So k=6: 10 + 39 = 49 seconds. ✓

For k=2: 2√10 + 39 = 6.32 + 39 = 45.32? No wait, second leg d₂=190.

Time for d₂=190: 5 + (190-25)/5 + 5 = 5 + 33 + 5 = 43? Or 5 + 190/5 = 43? Check: 5+33+5=43, 5+38=43. ✓

Total: 6.32 + 43 = 49.32s

So minimum is **49 seconds** (for k=6 to 35, actually achieved at the boundaries of that range too).

Actually at k=6, time = 49s exactly.
