The statement **"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."** is a **mnemonic** or memory aid to help people estimate the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Let’s break it down and explain it with examples.

---

### 🔍 What does it mean?

It suggests that if you take a temperature in **Celsius**, and you **add 12°C**, the **digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent** will be **inverted** (i.e., reversed).

This is not an exact conversion, but it's a **rough approximation** that can help you remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

---

### 📌 Example 1: 12°C

- **Celsius:** 12°C  
- **Fahrenheit:** 53.6°F  
- **Inverted digits of 53.6:** 635 (not exact, but the idea is that 12°C ≈ 53°F, and 53 is close to 63 if you invert the digits of 12)

So, **12°C ≈ 53°F**, and **53** is close to **63** (inverted digits of 12).

---

### 📌 Example 2: 24°C

- **Celsius:** 24°C  
- **Fahrenheit:** 75.2°F  
- **Inverted digits of 75.2:** 257 (again, not exact, but 24°C ≈ 75°F, and 75 is close to 57 if you invert the digits of 24)

So, **24°C ≈ 75°F**, and **75** is close to **57** (inverted digits of 24).

---

### 📌 Example 3: 36°C

- **Celsius:** 36°C  
- **Fahrenheit:** 96.8°F  
- **Inverted digits of 96.8:** 869 (again, not exact, but 36°C ≈ 96°F, and 96 is close to 69 if you invert the digits of 36)

So, **36°C ≈ 96°F**, and **96** is close to **69** (inverted digits of 36).

---

### ✅ Summary

This rule is **not exact**, but it's a **useful approximation** for quick mental math. It works best for **temperatures between 0°C and 100°C**, and it's especially helpful for **round numbers**.

---

### 📌 Note:

The actual formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

$$
°F = °C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32
$$

So, while the "inverted digits" rule is a fun and easy way to remember, it's not a substitute for the actual formula.

Would you like me to explain the reverse (Fahrenheit to Celsius) using a similar rule? [end of text]
