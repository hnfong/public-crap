I'll do my best to answer all the questions.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s.

First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the lift. Since each floor is 5 meters tall, the total distance is:

Distance = 40 floors x 5 meters/floor = 200 meters

Now, we can use the equation of motion:

s = ut + (1/2)at^2

where s is the distance, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration (1 m/s^2), and t is the time.

Rearranging the equation to solve for t, we get:

t = sqrt(2s/a)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = sqrt(2 x 200 meters / 1 m/s^2)
= sqrt(400)
= 20 seconds

So, it takes 20 seconds for the lift to reach the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the lift to accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s for each person.

For the first person going to 10/F, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 9 floors x 5 meters/floor = 45 meters

Using the same equation of motion as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
= sqrt(2 x 45 meters / 1 m/s^2)
= sqrt(90)
= 9.49 seconds

For the second person going to 30/F, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 29 floors x 5 meters/floor = 145 meters

Using the same equation of motion as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
= sqrt(2 x 145 meters / 1 m/s^2)
= sqrt(290)
= 17.08 seconds

Since the two people are traveling at different speeds, we need to find the time it takes for the lift to reach the midpoint of the two floors. The midpoint is:

Midpoint = (10/F + 30/F) / 2
= 20/F

The distance traveled by the lift to reach the midpoint is:

Distance = 19 floors x 5 meters/floor = 95 meters

Using the same equation of motion as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
= sqrt(2 x 95 meters / 1 m/s^2)
= sqrt(190)
= 13.78 seconds

Since the lift needs to stop at the midpoint, the total time it takes is the time to reach the midpoint plus the time to stop at the midpoint:

Total time = 13.78 seconds + 2 x 2 seconds (to stop at the midpoint and then start accelerating again)
= 13.78 seconds + 4 seconds
= 17.78 seconds

So, it takes approximately 17.78 seconds for the lift to reach the top floor.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum time it takes for the lift to reach the 40/F floor, assuming it stops at the closest floor to 40/F.

The closest floor to 40/F is 39/F. The distance traveled by the lift to reach the 39/F floor is:

Distance = 38 floors x 5 meters/floor = 190 meters

Using the same equation of motion as before:

t = sqrt(2s/a)
= sqrt(2 x 190 meters / 1 m/s^2)
= sqrt(380)
= 19.55 seconds

The lift will then accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s, and then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s. The time it takes to accelerate and decelerate is:

t = 2 x 2 seconds
= 4 seconds

Adding the time to reach the 39/F floor and the time to accelerate and decelerate, we get:

Total time = 19.55 seconds + 4 seconds
= 23.55 seconds

So, the minimum time it takes for the lift to reach the 40/F floor is approximately 23.55 seconds. [end of text]
