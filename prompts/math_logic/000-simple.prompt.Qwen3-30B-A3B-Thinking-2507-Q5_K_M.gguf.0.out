Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1: 1+1. That's straightforward, it's 2. 

Q2: 6*7. I remember 6 times 7 is 42. 

Q3: 83*59. Hmm, let me calculate that. 80*59 is 4720, and 3*59 is 177, so adding them gives 4720 + 177 = 4897. Wait, let me double-check: 83*60 would be 4980, minus 83 is 4980 - 83 = 4897. Yeah, that's right.

Q4: 349*683. This might be trickier. Let me break it down. 300*683 = 204,900. 40*683 = 27,320. 9*683 = 6,147. Adding those: 204,900 + 27,320 = 232,220; plus 6,147 is 238,367. Let me verify with another method. 349*600=209,400; 349*80=27,920; 349*3=1,047. Total: 209,400 + 27,920 = 237,320 + 1,047 = 238,367. Yep, that matches.

Q5: 6043*7489. This is a big multiplication. I'll need to be careful. Maybe use the standard algorithm. But since I'm doing this mentally, I'll approximate first. 6000*7500=45,000,000. But let's calculate exactly. 

First, 6043*7000 = 42,301,000. 
6043*400 = 2,417,200. 
6043*80 = 483,440. 
6043*9 = 54,387. 

Adding them up: 
42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200
44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640
45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027. 

Wait, let me check with another approach. 6043*7489. Maybe use (6000+43)*(7500-11). But that might complicate. Alternatively, trust the step-by-step. I think 45,256,027 is correct. I'll go with that.

Q6: Solve 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7: 3x=15. Divide by 3: x=5.

Q7: 25% of 80. 25% is 1/4, so 80/4=20.

Q8: Book costs $15. I give two 20s ($40) and a $5, so total $45. Shopkeeper needs to give back $45 - $15 = $30. But the question says she doesn't have exact change, so I gave an extra $5. Wait, the problem says: "I give her two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill." So total given: 20+20+5=45. Cost is 15, so change should be 45-15=30. But the shopkeeper might have given some change already? Wait, no. The problem states she doesn't have exact change for the two 20s, so I added a 5. So total payment is 45, cost 15, so change is 30. But the question is "what is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?" So $30. But let me read again: "I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill." So she didn't have change for the 40, so I gave 5 more, making it 45. So she should give back 45-15=30. So $30.

Q9: Perimeter of square with side 5. Perimeter = 4*side = 4*5=20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. So siblings: Katherine (female), two brothers, one sister. Total children: 1 (Katherine) + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children. So her mother has 4 children.

Q11: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1. Order of operations: division first. 12÷4=3. So 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom's birthday party, 5 guests arrived. How many slices of cake? The question doesn't specify how many slices per person. Typically, one slice per person, so 5 slices. But it's ambiguous. However, since it's a birthday party and no other info, I'll assume 5 slices.

Q13: Shirt $25, 20% off. 20% of 25 is 5, so sale price is 25-5=20.

Q14: Clock shows 3:45 PM. Until 6:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:45 is 3 hours (180 minutes), but we need until 6:30, which is 15 minutes before 6:45. So 180 - 15 = 165 minutes. Alternatively: 3:45 to 6:45 is 180 min, minus 15 min (since 6:30 is 15 min before 6:45) → 165 min. Or calculate directly: 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 min, 4:00 to 6:00 is 120 min, 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 min. Total: 15+120+30=165 min.

Q15: Taxi carries 4 passengers. Group of 22 people. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, so need 6 taxis (since 5 taxis would carry 20, leaving 2 people needing another taxi).

Q16: Triangle angles sum to 180. Two angles: 31 and 62. Sum is 93. Third angle: 180-93=87 degrees.
