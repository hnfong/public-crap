## Q1: Significance and Properties of 120

**Mathematical Properties:**

1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

2. **Highly Composite Number**: It has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120) — more divisors than any smaller number

3. **Sum of consecutive integers**: 
   - 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120 (triangular number T₁₅)
   - Also: 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 = 120

4. **Colossally abundant number** — related to divisor function properties

5. **Smallest number with exactly 16 divisors**

**Practical Significance:**
- **Degrees in geometry**: Interior angle of a regular hexagon = 120°
- **Time**: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- **Medical**: Normal systolic blood pressure is around 120 mmHg

## Q2: Solve x² - 7x - 18 = 0

**Step 1: Factor the quadratic**

I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Those numbers are: -9 and +2 (since -9 × 2 = -18 and -9 + 2 = -7)

Wait — let me check: -9 + 2 = -7 ✓, but I need +7x with negative sign...

Actually: I need -7x, so: (-9) + (+2) = -7 ✓

So: x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

**Step 2: Solve**
- x - 9 = 0  →  **x = 9**
- x + 2 = 0  →  **x = -2**

**Verification:**
- For x = 9: 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 ✓
- For x = -2: 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 ✓

**Answer: x = 9 or x = -2**

## Q3: Train Round Trips

**Step 1: Calculate one-way time**
- Distance = 200 km
- Speed = 60 km/h
- Time = 200/60 = 10/3 hours = 3 hours 20 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate round trip time**
- Round trip = 2 × (10/3) = 20/3 hours = 6 hours 40 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate number of round trips in 24 hours**
- Number of trips = 24 ÷ (20/3) = 24 × (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

**Step 4: Interpret result**
Since only complete round trips count: **3 full round trips**

(The 4th trip would require 26 hours 40 minutes total, exceeding 24 hours)

**Answer: 3 round trips** [end of text]
