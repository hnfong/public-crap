I need to solve these three questions about the elevator in a 40-story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall, so the total height from ground to top is 40 floors * 5 m/floor = 200 meters. The elevator accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s², and its maximum speed is 5 m/s.

First, question 1: How long does it take to go from ground floor to top floor directly?

The elevator needs to accelerate to its max speed, then travel at that speed, and then decelerate to stop. I need to find out if it reaches max speed or not, because the distance might be short enough that it doesn't have time to reach max speed before it has to decelerate.

Let me calculate the distance needed to accelerate to max speed.

Acceleration a = 1 m/s², max speed v_max = 5 m/s.

Time to reach max speed: t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds.

Distance during acceleration: s_acc = (1/2) * a * t_acc² = (1/2) * 1 * (5)² = (1/2)*25 = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, deceleration takes the same time and distance: t_dec = 5 seconds, s_dec = 12.5 meters.

So total distance for acceleration and deceleration is s_acc + s_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters.

Total height is 200 meters, so the distance at constant speed is s_const = total height - s_acc - s_dec = 200 - 25 = 175 meters.

Time at constant speed: t_const = s_const / v_max = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

Then total time: t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

But is this correct? Let me double-check.

The elevator starts from rest, accelerates to 5 m/s in 5 seconds, covering 12.5m. Then it goes at 5 m/s for 175m, taking 35 seconds. Then decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 in 5 seconds, covering 12.5m. Total distance: 12.5 + 175 + 12.5 = 200m, yes.

Total time: 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

But the building has floors, and we're going from 1/F to 40/F, which is 39 intervals? No.

Ground floor is 1/F, top floor is 40/F. So the height is from level 0 to level 200m, with floors at 0, 5, 10, ..., 200m. But since we're going from ground to top, it's from 0 to 200m.

Number of floors: from 1 to 40, that's 39 intervals of 5m each? Let's think.

Typically, the ground floor is at height 0, first floor might be at 0 or at 5m? I think I need to clarify.

The problem says: "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)". And "each floor is 5 meters tall". I think it means that the height from one floor to the next is 5m, so from ground floor to top floor, it's 39 * 5m? No.

Let's read carefully.

"Each floor is 5 meters tall." But floors are levels, so the distance between floors is 5m. So from floor 1 to floor 2 is 5m, up to floor 39 to 40 is 5m. So from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F), there are 39 intervals, so total height = 39 * 5 = 195 meters? But that can't be right because usually, the ground floor is at height 0, and the top floor at height 40*5 = 200m? I'm confused.

Perhaps I should think of the floors as points. Let's define the height.

Assume the ground floor (1/F) is at height 0m.

Then, floor 2 is at 5m, floor 3 at 10m, ..., up to floor 40 at 39*5 = 195m? 39 intervals from 1 to 40? From 1 to 2 is first interval, 2 to 3 second, ..., 39 to 40 is 39th interval, so yes, floor 40 is at height 39*5 = 195m above ground.

But the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall", which might be ambiguous. In building terms, the height of the building is from ground to top of top floor, so if there are 40 floors, each 5m tall, total height should be 40*5 = 200m, meaning floor 40 is at 200m.

I think there's inconsistency in terminology.

Let me check the problem: "a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." And "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)".

In many contexts, "ground floor" is considered floor 1 at height 0, and the top floor is at height (number of floors - 1) * height per floor, but that doesn't make sense for the height.

Perhaps it's better to think that the distance between consecutive floors is 5m, so from 1/F to 2/F is 5m, to 3/F is 10m, etc., so to 40/F is 39*5 = 195m from 1/F.

But the floor itself has height, but for elevator travel, we care about the distance traveled, which is between floors.

I think for elevator calculations, we consider the distance from start to end point.

Let me assume that the ground floor is at position 0, and each floor above is at 5m intervals, so floor 1 at 0m, floor 2 at 5m, floor 3 at 10m, ..., floor 40 at 39*5 = 195m? That would mean floor 40 is at 195m, but the building height is from ground to roof or to top floor ceiling?

The problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall", so the height from floor to ceiling is 5m, but for elevator, it stops at the floor level, so the position of the elevator stop is at the floor level.

Typically, for a building with n floors, the ground floor is at height 0, the first floor (if ground is separate) might be at 0 or at height, but here it says ground floor is 1/F, so I think 1/F is at 0, 2/F at 5m, ..., 40/F at 39*5 = 195m.

But let's confirm with the total height. If each floor is 5m tall, and there are 40 stories, the total height from ground to top should be 40*5 = 200m, meaning the top floor is at 200m, so floors are at 0, 5, 10, ..., 195, 200? But 40 floors from 0 to 200 would be 41 points, which is confusing.

I think I have a standard way: in elevator problems, the number of floors is the number of levels, and the distance between levels is the floor height.

So for 40 stories, from 1/F to 40/F, there are 39 intervals of 5m each, so total distance 195m.

But let's see the problem: "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)" and "each floor is 5 meters tall". I think "each floor is 5 meters tall" means the height from one floor to the next is 5m, so distance between floors is 5m.

So from 1/F to 40/F, it's 39 floors up, so 39 * 5m = 195m.

Similarly, in question 2, from 1/F to 10/F is 9*5 = 45m, to 30/F is 29*5 = 145m, etc.

I think that's standard.

To be sure, let's calculate the total distance.

If the building has 40 stories, each 5m tall, the height from ground to top floor is 40*5 = 200m, but that includes the height from ground to ceiling of top floor, but the elevator stops at the floor level, so for top floor, it stops at the floor level, which is below the ceiling.

I think for simplicity, in such problems, we consider the position of the floors: floor k at height (k-1)*5 meters for k=1 to 40, so 1/F at 0, 40/F at 39*5 = 195m.

Or sometimes floor 1 at 0, floor 2 at 5, ..., floor 40 at 195m.

Yes, that makes sense for distance traveled.

I think I should go with that, as it's common.

So for question 1, from 1/F to 40/F, distance s = 39 * 5 = 195 meters.

Similarly, acceleration a = 1 m/s², v_max = 5 m/s.

Time to accelerate to v_max: t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 s.

Distance during acceleration: s_acc = (1/2) a t_acc² = (1/2)(1)(25) = 12.5 m.

Similarly for deceleration, t_dec = 5 s, s_dec = 12.5 m.

Total for acc and dec: 25 m.

Distance at constant speed: s_const = s - s_acc - s_dec = 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170 m.

Time at constant speed: t_const = s_const / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 s.

Total time: t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds.

But is s_const positive? 195 - 25 = 170, yes.

If I thought total height 200m, it would be 200-25=175, t_const=35, total 45s, but I think 195m is correct.

Let me confirm with another way.

The elevator must reach v_max or not? 12.5m to accelerate, 12.5m to decelerate, total 25m, which is less than 195m, so yes, it reaches v_max.

So for question 1, time is 44 seconds.

But let's keep it as is for now.

Now question 2: Two people, one to 10/F, one to 30/F.

Lift starts from 1/F (0m), goes to 10/F and then to 30/F.

First, to 10/F: height of 10/F is (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45m.

Similarly, 30/F is (30-1)*5 = 29*5 = 145m.

Lift goes from 0 to 45m, stops at 10/F, then from 45m to 145m to 30/F.

But when it stops at 10/F, it decelerates to stop, then accelerates again to go to 30/F.

The question is to find the time for both people to reach their floors, but it says "how long does it take?" for the lift trip, I think, from start until both are dropped off, but since they get on together, and first gets off at 10, second at 30, so time until the lift reaches 30/F with stops.

The question: "How long does it take?" but for whom? It says "for a person" in Q1, but here "two people", so I think it means the time from ground to when the second person gets off at 30/F.

Similarly, in Q1, from ground to top.

So for Q2, time from start at 1/F to arrival at 30/F with a stop at 10/F.

So the lift goes: from 1/F to 10/F, stop, then from 10/F to 30/F.

We need the time for this journey.

First leg: from 1/F (0m) to 10/F (45m).

Distance s1 = 45m.

Now, for this segment, does it reach max speed?

Acceleration to v_max: t_acc = 5s, s_acc = 12.5m.

Deceleration to stop: t_dec = 5s, s_dec = 12.5m.

Total acc/dec distance: 25m.

s1 = 45m > 25m, so it reaches v_max.

s_const = s1 - s_acc - s_dec = 45 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 20m.

t_const = 20 / 5 = 4s.

Time for first leg: t1 = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14s.

Now, at 10/F, it stops, so it decelerates to stop, which takes time, and then it will accelerate again for the next leg.

But when it stops, it has to decelerate to zero, which we included, and then for the next leg, it starts from rest at 10/F.

Second leg: from 10/F (45m) to 30/F (145m), so distance s2 = 145 - 45 = 100m.

Now, from rest at 45m to 145m.

Similarly, t_acc = 5s, s_acc = 12.5m

t_dec = 5s, s_dec = 12.5m

s_const = s2 - s_acc - s_dec = 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75m

t_const = 75 / 5 = 15s

Time for second leg: t2 = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25s

Now, total time from start to 30/F: time for first leg plus time for second leg.

But between legs, when it stops at 10/F, after deceleration, it is stopped, and then it starts accelerating for the next leg. There might be a waiting time, but the problem doesn't specify any waiting; it just stops to let the person off, and then immediately starts again, I assume, since no time is given for stopping.

The problem says "the lift has to stop at another floor", but in this case, for Q2, it's a normal stop.

In the acceleration/deceleration, we have included the time to stop and start, but the actual stop duration is zero, I think, meaning no dwell time, just the time to decelerate and accelerate.

In the time calculation, t_dec includes deceleration to stop, and t_acc includes acceleration from stop, so the stop itself is instantaneous, I assume.

So total time should be t1 + t2 = 14s + 25s = 39s.

But is that from start to 30/F? Yes.

The first person got off at 10/F at time t1=14s, and second at t=39s.

But the question is "how long does it take?" for the lift to complete the trip with both stops, I think.

Perhaps it's the time until both are delivered, but since they are on the same lift, it's the time to 30/F.

I think 39s is the time to reach 30/F.

But let's confirm the distances.

Another thing: when going from 1/F to 10/F, it stops at 10/F, which is correct.

Then from 10/F to 30/F, it goes directly, no stop in between.

Yes.

Now, for s2=100m, which is greater than 25m, so reaches v_max, fine.

Now, question 3: Two people, first to 40/F, second to another floor between 1 and 40, not 40/F. We need the minimum time to get to 40/F with a stop at another floor.

The lift must stop at another floor to let the second person off, and then go to 40/F.

We need to minimize the time to reach 40/F, so we need to choose which floor to stop at for the second person to minimize the total time to 40/F.

The second person gets off at some floor k/F, where k between 2 and 39, I assume, since not ground and not top.

Then lift goes to 40/F.

Time to 40/F depends on where we stop.

Let me define the height.

Set 1/F at 0m, so 40/F at 39*5 = 195m.

Let the stop floor be at height h, where h = (f-1)*5 for f from 2 to 39, so h from 5m to 190m, but since floors at discrete points, but we can think continuously for minimization, I think, and then find the floor.

Since acceleration is constant, we can find the optimal point.

The lift goes from 0 to h, stop, then from h to 195m.

Time to go from 0 to h with stop: similar to before.

First, from 0 to h: distance s1 = h.

Time for this segment: since it stops at h, it accelerates, may reach max speed, decelerates to stop.

Similarly for the next segment.

But to minimize total time to 195m, we need to choose h.

The total time to reach 195m is the time from start to h plus time from h to 195m.

Let t1(h) be time from 0 to h with stop at h.

t2(h) be time from h to 195m with start from rest and stop at 195m.

Then total time T(h) = t1(h) + t2(h)

We need min T(h) for h between 5 and 190m, say.

But h must be a multiple of 5, but we can find min over real h and then take nearest floor.

First, for a given distance s, with stop at end, what is the time.

For a distance s, with acceleration a, deceleration a, max speed v_max.

The time to travel s with stop at end.

If s is small, it may not reach v_max.

The critical distance where it just reaches v_max: when s_acc + s_dec = (1/2) a t_acc^2 + (1/2) a t_dec^2, but t_acc = t_dec = v_max / a, so s_min for max speed = 2 * (1/2) a (v_max/a)^2 = a (v_max^2 / a^2) = v_max^2 / a.

With a=1, v_max=5, s_min = 25 / 1 = 25m.

If s <= 25m, it doesn't reach v_max; it accelerates and then decelerates immediately.

If s > 25m, it reaches v_max and has constant speed phase.

For s <= 25m:

The time: let t be time to accelerate to some v, then decelerate to 0.

Since a and deceleration same, it accelerates for t/2 to v, then decelerates to 0 in t/2.

Distance: s = integral, or s = (1/2) a (t/2)^2 * 2? Better: from start, accelerate for time t_acc to v, then decelerate for time t_dec to 0, with v = a t_acc, and 0 = v - a t_dec, so t_dec = t_acc, since a same.

And s = (1/2) a t_acc^2 + (v t_dec - (1/2) a t_dec^2) but since deceleration, position: during acc, s_acc = (1/2) a t_acc^2

During dec, it starts from v, dec a, to 0, s_dec = v t_dec - (1/2) a t_dec^2

But v = a t_acc, t_dec = t_acc, so s_dec = (a t_acc) t_acc - (1/2) a t_acc^2 = a t_acc^2 - (1/2) a t_acc^2 = (1/2) a t_acc^2

Thus total s = s_acc + s_dec = (1/2) a t_acc^2 + (1/2) a t_acc^2 = a t_acc^2

Since t_acc = t_dec.

So s = a t_acc^2, so t_acc = sqrt(s / a)

Then total time t = 2 t_acc = 2 sqrt(s / a)

For s <= s_min.

If s > s_min, t = t_acc + t_dec + t_const = 2 (v_max / a) + (s - s_min)/v_max

Since s_min = v_max^2 / a

In this case a=1, v_max=5, s_min=25m.

For s <= 25m, t(s) = 2 sqrt(s / 1) = 2 sqrt(s)

For s > 25m, t(s) = 2*(5/1) + (s - 25)/5 = 10 + (s-25)/5

Now, back to t1(h): time from 0 to h with stop at h.

t1(h) = t(s) with s=h.

Similarly, for t2(h): from h to 195m, distance s2 = 195 - h

t2(h) = t(s2) with s=195-h

Then T(h) = t1(h) + t2(h) = t(h) + t(195 - h)

We need to minimize T(h) for h in [5,190] or something.

Since the building from 0 to 195, h from 5 to 190, but approximately.

T(h) = t(h) + t(195 - h)

t(s) as above.

To find min over h.

Since t(s) is convex, T(h) might have minimum at some point.

Consider the two cases.

First, if both h and 195-h are greater than 25m, which they are since min h=5<25, but 195-h, if h small, 195-h large, etc.

h from 0 to 195, but h min about 5, max 190.

195-5=190>25, 195-190=5<25, etc.

So we need to consider different regions.

Define the critical points.

t(s) = { 2 sqrt(s)  for 0<s<=25

         10 + (s-25)/5 for s>25 }

Now T(h) = t(h) + t(195-h)

For h in [0,195]

But since s>0, and h>=5, 195-h<=190.

Now, let's find where h <=25 and 195-h <=25? 195-25=170, so if h<=25 and 195-h<=25, but 195-h<=25 implies h>=170, and h<=25, impossible since 170>25. So cannot both be <=25.

Similarly, both >=25: h>=25 and 195-h>=25, so h<=170.

So for h in [25,170], both t(h) and t(195-h) use the linear part.

t(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 for h>25

Similarly t(195-h) = 10 + (195-h-25)/5 = 10 + (170-h)/5 for 195-h>25, i.e., h<170.

For h in [25,170], T(h) = [10 + (h-25)/5] + [10 + (170-h)/5] = 20 + (h-25)/5 + (170-h)/5 = 20 + [ (h-25) + (170-h) ] /5 = 20 + (145)/5 = 20 + 29 = 49

Compute:

(h-25)/5 + (170-h)/5 = [ (h-25) + (170-h) ] /5 = (h - 25 + 170 - h)/5 = (145)/5 = 29

Then T(h) = 10 + 10 + 29? No:

t(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5

t(195-h) = 10 + (170-h)/5

So T(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 + 10 + (170-h)/5 = 20 + [ (h-25) + (170-h) ] /5 = 20 + (145)/5 = 20 + 29 = 49

And this is constant for h in [25,170].

Now, for h < 25, t(h) = 2 sqrt(h)

t(195-h): since h<25, 195-h > 170 >25, so t(195-h) = 10 + (195-h-25)/5 = 10 + (170-h)/5

Then T(h) = 2 sqrt(h) + 10 + (170-h)/5

Similarly, for h > 170, then 195-h < 25, so t(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 since h>170>25

t(195-h) = 2 sqrt(195-h)

Then T(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 + 2 sqrt(195-h)

Now, for h in [25,170], T(h)=49, constant.

For h<25, T(h) = 2 sqrt(h) + 10 + (170-h)/5

For h>170, T(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 + 2 sqrt(195-h)

Since we want min T(h), and for h in [25,170] it's 49, now let's see for h<25 and h>170.

First, for h<25, T(h) = 2 sqrt(h) + 10 + (170-h)/5

Simplify: 10 + 170/5 - h/5 + 2 sqrt(h) = 10 + 34 - h/5 + 2 sqrt(h) = 44 - (1/5)h + 2 sqrt(h)

Now, let x = sqrt(h), so h = x^2, x from 0 to 5 since h<25.

T(x) = 44 - (1/5)x^2 + 2x

This is a quadratic in x: - (1/5)x^2 + 2x + 44

Since coefficient of x^2 is negative, it has a maximum at x= -b/(2a) = -2 / (2*(-1/5)) = -2 / (-2/5) = 2 * 5/2 = 5

x=5, which is at the boundary h=25.

For x<5, since it opens downward, T(x) decreases as x increases to 5? a = -1/5 <0, so parabola opens downward, vertex at x=5.

x= -b/(2a) = - (2) / (2 * (-1/5)) = -2 / (-2/5) = 2 * 5/2 = 5, yes.

At x=5, T=44 - (1/5)(25) + 2(5) = 44 - 5 + 10 = 49, which matches.

For x<5, since vertex at x=5 and opens down, for x<5, as x decreases, T decreases? No.

For example, at x=5, T=49.

At x=4, h=16, T=44 - (1/5)(16) + 2(4) = 44 - 16/5 + 8 = 44 + 8 - 3.2 = 52 - 3.2 = 48.8? 44 + 8 = 52, minus 16/5=3.2, so 52-3.2=48.8

48.8 < 49? 48.8 is less than 49.

But x=4, h=16<25.

T=44 - (1/5)(16) + 2(4) = 44 - 3.2 + 8 = (44+8) - 3.2 = 52 - 3.2 = 48.8

At x=5, h=25, T=44 - (1/5)(25) + 2(5) = 44 - 5 + 10 = 49

49 > 48.8, so at h=16, T=48.8 < 49.

But for the segment, t1(h) for h=16m.

h=16m, which is less than 25m, so t(h) = 2 sqrt(16) = 2*4 = 8s

Then t(195-h) = t(179) = since 179>25, t=10 + (179-25)/5 = 10 + 154/5 = 10 + 30.8 = 40.8s

Then T= t(h) + t(195-h) = 8 + 40.8 = 48.8s

At h=25, t(h)=10 + (25-25)/5=10+0=10s? t(s) for s=25, since s=25=s_min, it can be considered with or without constant speed, but at s=25, if it accelerates to v_max and decelerates immediately, time t=2*(5) =10s, or with constant speed zero.

t=10s.

t(195-25)=t(170)=10 + (170-25)/5=10 + 145/5=10+29=39s

T=10+39=49s

Yes.

Now at h=16, T=48.8<49.

But h=16m, which floor? Floors at 5m intervals, 16/5=3.2, not integer, but approximately.

Similarly, for h>170.

First, let's see the function.

T(h) for h<25: T(h) = 2 sqrt(h) + 10 + (170-h)/5

As above.

Derivative: dT/dh = 2*(1/2) h^{-1/2} *1 + 0 - 1/5 = h^{-1/2} - 1/5

Set to zero: 1/sqrt(h) - 1/5 =0, so 1/sqrt(h) =1/5, sqrt(h)=5, h=25.

But at h=25, it is the boundary.

For h<25, dT/dh = 1/sqrt(h) - 1/5

Since sqrt(h) <5 for h<25, 1/sqrt(h) > 1/5, so dT/dh >0? 1/sqrt(h) >1/5, so dT/dh >0, meaning T increasing as h increases for h<25.

At h=16, sqrt(h)=4, 1/4=0.25, 1/5=0.2, so dT/dh=0.25-0.2=0.05>0, so as h increases, T increases.

At h=16, T=48.8, at h=25, T=49, yes, increases.

But for smaller h, say h=1, T(h)=2 sqrt(1) +10 + (170-1)/5 = 2*1 +10 + 169/5 = 2+10+33.8=45.8

169/5=33.8, yes.

Then t(195-h)=t(194)=10 + (194-25)/5=10 + 169/5=10+33.8=43.8? t(194) for s=194>25, t=10 + (194-25)/5=10 + 169/5=10+33.8=43.8

T= t(h) + t(194) = 2*sqrt(1) + something, t(h) for h=1: 2*sqrt(1)=2

Then T=2 + 43.8=45.8

At h=25, T=49

So as h decreases from 25 to 1, T decreases from 49 to 45.8.

Similarly, at h=0, but h=0 not possible, but as h->0, t(h)->0, t(195-h)=t(195)= for s=195>25, t=10 + (195-25)/5=10 + 170/5=10+34=44

Then T-> 0 + 44 =44, but h=0 not a stop floor.

Minimum h is about 5m, floor 2 at 5m.

h=5m, t(h)=2 sqrt(5) ≈ 2*2.236 = 4.472s

t(195-h)=t(190)=10 + (190-25)/5=10 + 165/5=10+33=43s

T≈4.472 + 43 = 47.472s

At h=25, T=49s

Now for h>170.

Similarly, T(h) = 10 + (h-25)/5 + 2 sqrt(195-h)

For example, h=190, t(h)=10 + (190-25)/5=10 + 165/5=10+33=43s

t(195-h)=t(5)=2 sqrt(5)≈4.472s

T=43 + 4.472=47.472s

Same as above.

At h=170, t(h)=10 + (170-25)/5=10 + 145/5=10+29=39s

t(195-170)=t(25)=10s

T=39+10=49s

Now, for h>170, T(h)=10 + (h-25)/5 + 2 sqrt(195-h)

Let y = sqrt(195-h), so 195-h = y^2, h=195-y^2

Then T(y) = 10 + ( (195-y^2) -25 )/5 + 2 y = 10 + (170 - y^2)/5 + 2y = 10 + 170/5 - (y^2)/5 + 2y = 10 + 34 - (1/5)y^2 + 2y = 44 - (1/5)y^2 + 2y

Same as before for the other side.

dT/dy = - (2/5)y + 2

Set to zero: - (2/5)y + 2 =0, (2/5)y=2, y=2*(5/2)=5

Then h=195-y^2=195-25=170

At y=5, h=170.

And T=44 - (1/5)(25) + 2(5) =44-5+10=49

For y<5, meaning h>170, dT/dy = - (2/5)y + 2, at y<5, - (2/5)y > -2, so dT/dy >0? y<5, say y=4, - (2/5)(4) +2 = -8/5 + 10/5 = 2/5>0, so T increasing as y increases, but y= sqrt(195-h), as y increases, h decreases.

Since dT/dy >0 for y<5, T increases with y, so decreases with h for h>170.

For example, h=190, y=sqrt(5)≈2.236, T=47.472

h=170, y=5, T=49

So T decreases as h increases from 170 to 190.

In both ends, for h<25 or h>170, T(h) <49, and decreases as we go away from the center.

The minimum time would be at the extremes, but since h must be between 5 and 190, T is smaller when h is small or large.

For example, at h=5, T≈47.472s

At h=190, same.

But is this the time to 40
