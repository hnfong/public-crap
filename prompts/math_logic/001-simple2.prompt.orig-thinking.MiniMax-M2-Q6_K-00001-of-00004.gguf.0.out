I have three questions to answer. I'll tackle them one by one, providing steps and explanations. If I'm unsure, I'll mention it.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

First, I know that 120 is a highly composite number. That means it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me list the divisors of 120 to confirm.

120 divided by 1 is 120.

2 is 60.

3 is 40.

4 is 30.

5 is 24.

6 is 20.

8 is 15.

10 is 12.

12 is 10, but that's the same as above, so I should list unique divisors.

The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's 16 divisors. I think that's more than any smaller number. For example, 60 has 12 divisors, 90 has 12, 100 has 9, so yes, 120 is highly composite.

120 is also a factorial. 5! = 120. That's interesting because factorials grow quickly, and 5! is 120.

120 is a sum of twin primes. Twin primes are pairs of primes differing by 2. Like 59 and 61, 59+61=120. Also, 41 and 79? 41+79=120, but are they twin? 41 and 43 are twins, but 79 is not twin with 41. 59 and 61 are both prime and differ by 2, so yes, 59+61=120. Also, 41+79=120, but 79 is not prime? 79 is prime, but 41 and 79 differ by 38, not 2. Twin primes are pairs like (3,5), (5,7), (11,13), etc. So for sum to be 120, it could be two different twin prime pairs, but not necessarily a pair themselves. The question says "sum of twin primes," which might mean the sum of two primes that are twins, but not necessarily to each other. So 59 and 61 are twins, sum to 120. Also, 41 and 79, but 79 is not twin with 41. 41 is twin with 43, but 43+77? 77 not prime. 31+89=120, 31 is twin with 29, 89 is twin with 87? 87 not prime. 19+101=120, 19 twin with 17, 101 twin with 103. 17+103=120, both twin primes. 17 and 19 are twins, 103 and 101 are twins, but here it's 17 and 103, which are not twins to each other. But the sum is of two twin primes, meaning each is part of a twin prime pair. So yes, 17 and 103 are both twin primes, sum to 120. Similarly, 59 and 61 are a twin prime pair themselves. So multiple ways.

120 is also a Harshad number. A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits. Sum of digits of 120 is 1+2+0=3, and 120 divided by 3 is 40, so yes.

120 is a superfactorial. Superfactorial is the product of factorials. 1! * 2! * 3! * 4! = 1*2*6*24=288, not 120. Or sometimes defined as product of first n factorials, but 1! to 4! is 288. 5! is 120, but that's factorial, not superfactorial. I think superfactorial is different.

120 is a pentagonal number. Pentagonal numbers are given by n(3n-1)/2. For n=9, 9*26/2=117, not 120. n=10, 10*29/2=145, too big. Not pentagonal.

Hexagonal? n(2n-1), n=8, 8*15=120, yes! So 120 is a hexagonal number.

Also, 120 is an abundant number. Abundant if sum of proper divisors exceeds the number. Proper divisors exclude itself. Sum of proper divisors: 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60= let's calculate: 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, +8=29, +10=39, +12=51, +15=66, +20=86, +24=110, +30=140, +40=180, +60=240. 240 is greater than 120, so yes, abundant.

120 is the smallest number with 16 divisors, as I said.

In time, 120 minutes is 2 hours, but that's not particularly significant mathematically.

120 degrees is a common angle in geometry, like in equilateral triangles, but that's the measure, not the number itself.

I think I have enough properties. So to summarize:

- Highly composite number (16 divisors)

- Factorial: 5! = 120

- Sum of twin primes (e.g., 59+61, 17+103)

- Harshad number (divisible by sum of digits 1+2+0=3)

- Hexagonal number (8th hexagonal number)

- Abundant number

- Also, 120 is the number of degrees in a standard protractor, but again, not mathematical significance.

I think that's sufficient.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

This is a quadratic equation. I can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.

Let me try factoring. I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Factors of -18: possible pairs: 1 and -18, sum -17; 2 and -9, sum -7; 3 and -6, sum -3; 6 and -3, sum 3; 9 and -2, sum 7; 18 and -1, sum 17. So 2 and -9: 2*(-9)= -18, 2+(-9)= -7. Yes!

So, (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0? Let me check: (x+2)(x-9) = x^2 -9x +2x -18 = x^2 -7x -18. Yes, perfect.

So, x + 2 = 0 or x - 9 = 0, so x = -2 or x = 9.

Using quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2 = [7 ± 11]/2.

So, (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, (7-11)/2 = -4/2 = -2. Same answer.

So, solutions are x = -2 and x = 9.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

First, a round trip means going from city A to city B and back to city A. So, distance for one round trip is 200 km to B and 200 km back to A, so 400 km.

Speed is 60 km/h. So, time for one round trip is distance divided by speed: 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours.

Now, a full day is 24 hours. So, number of round trips in 24 hours is total time divided by time per round trip: 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

But since it can't make a fraction of a trip, and we need whole trips, so it can make 3 full round trips? But 3.6 means it can make 3 trips and part of the fourth, but since time stationed is negligible, and we assume it can start immediately, but for a round trip, it needs to complete the return.

After 3 round trips, time used is 3 * (20/3) = 20 hours. Then remaining time is 24 - 20 = 4 hours.

In 4 hours, at 60 km/h, it can travel 4 * 60 = 240 km.

Since the distance to the other city is 200 km,
