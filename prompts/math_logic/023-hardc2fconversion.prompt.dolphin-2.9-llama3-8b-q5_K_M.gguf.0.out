"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This means that when you want to convert a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can apply a simple rule: for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits of the number are inverted (flipped). This is a helpful memory aid for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

For example, let's say the temperature is 25°C. To convert this to Fahrenheit, we can apply the rule:

- First, we identify the 12°C increments. In this case, there are two increments of 12°C: (20°C to 12°C) and (12°C to 0°C).
- Next, we apply the inversion rule to each increment:
  1. Between 20°C and 12°C, we reverse the digits: 20 becomes 02.
  2. Between 12°C and 0°C, we reverse the digits as well: 12 becomes 21.
- Finally, we combine the results: 02 + 21 = 23.
- Therefore, 25°C is equivalent to 77°F (25°C * 9/5 + 32 = 77°F).

Another example: let's say the temperature is 32°C. To convert this to Fahrenheit, we can apply the rule:

- There's only one increment of 12°C in this case: from 32°C to 20°C.
- We apply the inversion rule to this increment: 32 becomes 23.
- So, 32°C is equivalent to 89.6°F (32°C * 9/5 + 32 = 89.6°F).
