Here's my attempt at solving these problems.

**1. Time to reach the top floor**

* **Calculate the total height:** 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters
* **Divide the journey into phases:**
    * **Acceleration phase:** The lift accelerates to its maximum speed.
    * **Constant speed phase:** The lift travels at its maximum speed.
    * **Deceleration phase:** The lift decelerates to a stop.
* **Calculate the time for each phase:**

    * **Acceleration phase:**
        * Use the equation: v = u + at, where:
            * v = final velocity (5 m/s)
            * u = initial velocity (0 m/s)
            * a = acceleration (1 m/s²)
            * t = time
        * Solving for t: t = (v - u) / a = (5 - 0) / 1 = 5 seconds
        * Calculate the distance covered during acceleration: s = ut + (1/2)at² = 0*5 + (1/2)*1*5² = 12.5 meters

    * **Constant speed phase:**
        * Distance remaining: 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters
        * Time = distance / speed = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds

    * **Deceleration phase:**
        * This is symmetrical to the acceleration phase, so it also takes 5 seconds.

* **Total time:** 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds + 5 seconds = **47.5 seconds**

**2. Time for two people going to different floors**

* **Person 1 (10th floor):**
    * Height: 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters
    * Follow the same steps as in question 1, but adjust the distances for the acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration phases.

* **Person 2 (30th floor):**
    * Height: 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters
    * Follow the same steps as in question 1, but adjust the distances.

* **Important Note:** The lift will likely need to stop at the 10th floor to drop off the first person, adding extra time to the journey for the second person.

**3. Minimum time with an extra stop**

* This is a more complex problem. To minimize the time, we need to strategically choose the floor where the lift stops.

* **Consideration:** The lift will spend time accelerating and decelerating at each stop.

* **Approach:**

    * **Analyze the time taken for different stop floors:** Calculate the total time for the lift to reach the 40th floor with stops at various floors between 1st and 39th.

    * **Identify the minimum time:** The floor that results in the shortest total time is the optimal stop.

* **Note:** This will involve a lot of calculations, and there might be a more elegant mathematical solution.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific part or try to find a more efficient solution for question 3. [end of text]
