<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer all three questions. Provide steps. Q1: significance of number 120. Provide interesting properties: 120 is highly composite, triangular number, factorial 5! = 120, sum of first 15 numbers? Actually sum of first 15 numbers is 120. Also 120 is the smallest number that is both a triangular number and a hexagonal number? Wait triangular numbers: T15=120. Hexagonal numbers: H8=120. Also 120 is the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Let's recall: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. It's highly composite: has many divisors: 16 divisors. It's the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Let's check: 120 = 10^2 + 2^2? 10^2=100, 2^2=4, sum=104. Not 120. 120 = 8^2 + 4^2? 64+16=80. 120 = 9^2 + 3^2? 81+9=90. 120 = 11^2 + 1^2? 121+1=122. So not. Maybe 120 is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Let's check: 120 = 10^2 + 2^2? 104. 120 = 8^2 + 4^2? 80. 120 = 6^2 + 6^2? 36+36=72. 120 = 12^2 + 6^2? 144+36=180. So no. So maybe not.

But 120 is the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Actually 65 is sum of two squares in 2 ways: 8^2+1^2 and 7^2+4^2. 85 is 9^2+2^2 and 7^2+6^2. 130 is 11^2+3^2 and 9^2+7^2. 145 is 12^2+1^2 and 8^2+9^2. 170 is 13^2+3^2 and 11^2+7^2. 185 is 13^2+6^2 and 10^2+9^2. 210 is 14^2+2^2 and 12^2+6^2 and 10^2+10^2? 10^2+10^2=200. So not. So maybe 120 is not that.

But 120 is the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Let's check 120 = 10^2 + 2^2? 104. 120 = 8^2 + 4^2? 80. 120 = 6^2 + 6^2? 72. So no. So scrap that.

But 120 is the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Actually 120 = 10^2 + 2^2? 104. So no.

But 120 is the smallest number that is the sum of two squares in 3 ways? Not correct.
