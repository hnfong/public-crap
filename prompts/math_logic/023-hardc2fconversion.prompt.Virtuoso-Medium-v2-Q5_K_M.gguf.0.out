This statement is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. It suggests that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are inverted (swapped).

Let's break it down with examples:

1. 0°C = 32°F
2. 12°C = 54°F (32 + 22 = 54)
3. 24°C = 76°F (54 + 22 = 76)
4. 36°C = 98°F (76 + 22 = 98)

In each case, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted compared to the previous step:

- 32°F (0°C) → 54°F (12°C)
- 54°F (12°C) → 76°F (24°C)
- 76°F (24°C) → 98°F (36°C)

This pattern helps you remember the approximate conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures at these specific points. However, it's important to note that this is a rough approximation and not an exact conversion method. The actual conversion formula is:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Using this formula, you can calculate the exact Fahrenheit temperature for any given Celsius temperature. The mnemonic device is useful for quick mental estimates but may not be accurate for precise conversions. [end of text]
