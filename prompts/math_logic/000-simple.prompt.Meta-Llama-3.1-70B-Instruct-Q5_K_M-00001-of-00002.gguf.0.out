I'll do my best to answer the questions. Here are the answers:

Q1: 1+1= 2

Q2: 6*7= 42

Q3: 83*59= 4897

Q4: 349*683= 238667

Q5: 6043*7489= 45255167

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. 
To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7, 3x = 15. Then, divide both sides by 3: x = 15/3, x = 5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80? 
25% of 80 is 0.25 x 80 = 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. 
You gave the shopkeeper 2 x $20 = $40 and an additional $5, for a total of $45. The book costs $15, so the change is $45 - $15 = $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. 
The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter is 4 x 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? 
Katherine has two brothers and a sister, and Katherine is also a child, so her mother has 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 
To evaluate the expression, follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): 12 รท 4 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6, and finally 6 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? 
The question doesn't specify the number of slices per guest, so I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5 slices, assuming one slice per guest.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? 
20% of $25 is 0.20 x $25 = $5. The sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? 
From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is 135 minutes. From 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM is an additional 30 minutes. So, the total number of minutes is 135 + 30 = 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? 
To find the number of taxis, divide the number of people by the number of passengers per taxi: 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a taxi, you need 6 taxis.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? 
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let x be the measure of the third angle. Then, 31 + 62 + x = 180. Combine like terms: 93 + x = 180. Subtract 93 from both sides: x = 87. [end of text]
