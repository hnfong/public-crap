Okay, here are the answers to your questions, with steps and explanations:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has significance in several areas of mathematics and everyday life. Here's a breakdown:

* **Factorial:** 120 is 5! (5 factorial), meaning 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Factorials are important in combinatorics (counting arrangements) and probability.
* **Smallest Common Multiple:** 120 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all positive integers from 1 to 6.  This makes it useful in finding common denominators and working with multiples.
* **Degrees in an Angle:** A regular hexagon has interior angles of 120 degrees each.
* **Minutes in an Hour:** There are 120 minutes in two hours.
* **Seconds in Two Minutes:** There are 120 seconds in two minutes.

**Interesting Properties:**

* **Divisors:** The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.  It has a relatively large number of divisors for its size.
* **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
* **Prime Factorization:** The prime factorization of 120 is 2<sup>3</sup> * 3 * 5.
* **Sum of Divisors:** The sum of all its divisors is 360.
* **Tetrahedral Number:** 120 is a tetrahedral number, representing the number of spheres that can be stacked to form a tetrahedron.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring.

**Steps:**

1. **Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.** These numbers are -9 and 2.  (-9 * 2 = -18 and -9 + 2 = -7)

2. **Factor the equation:** (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

3. **Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:**
   * x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
   * x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

**Therefore, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.**

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time for one trip (one way):**
   Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately, or 10/3 hours)

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip:**
   Round trip time = 2 * one-way time = 2 * (10/3) hours = 20/3 hours = 6.67 hours (approximately)

3. **Calculate the total time available in a full day:**
   A full day has 24 hours.

4. **Calculate the number of round trips:**
   Number of round trips = Total time / Round trip time = 24 hours / (20/3) hours = 24 * (3/20) = 72/20 = 3.6

5. **Since the train can only complete *whole* round trips, round down to the nearest whole number.**

**Therefore, the train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day.**
