I'll answer each question step by step.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! (5 factorial) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
2. **Triangular number**: 120 is the 15th triangular number (sum of integers from 1 to 15)
3. **Highly composite number**: It has many divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120)
4. **Divisor count**: It has exactly 16 divisors
5. **Historical significance**: In ancient Egypt, 120 was considered a sacred number
6. **In mathematics**: It's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: 120 = 1³ + 5³ = 1 + 125 and 120 = 2³ + 4³ = 8 + 64 (Wait, this is incorrect - let me reconsider)

Actually, 120 = 1³ + 5³ = 1 + 125 = 126, not 120. Let me correct this:
120 = 4³ + 2³ = 64 + 8 = 72, not 120.
120 = 3³ + 3³ = 27 + 27 = 54, not 120.

I am not sure about the specific mathematical property of 120 being expressible as sum of two cubes in two ways, but it's definitely a highly composite number with many divisors.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

I'll solve this quadratic equation using factoring method:

Step 1: Look for two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7
- Factors of -18: (1,-18), (-1,18), (2,-9), (-2,9), (3,-6), (-3,6)
- Check which pair adds to -7: (-9) + 2 = -7 ✓

Step 2: Factor the quadratic
x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Step 3: Apply zero product property
x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = 9 or x = -2

Step 4: Verify solutions
For x = 9: 9² - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 ✓
For x = -2: (-2)² - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 ✓

**Answer**: x = 9 or x = -2

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Step 1: Calculate time for one round trip
- Distance for one round trip = 200 km × 2 = 400 km
- Time = Distance ÷ Speed = 400 km ÷ 60 km/h = 6.67 hours = 6 hours 40 minutes

Step 2: Calculate how many round trips in 24 hours
- Number of round trips = 24 hours ÷ 6.67 hours per trip = 3.6
- Since we can only complete whole trips, the train can make 3 complete round trips

Step 3: Verify
- 3 round trips = 3 × 6.67 hours = 20 hours
- Remaining time = 24 - 20 = 4 hours
- With 4 hours, the train could start a 4th trip but wouldn't complete it

**Answer**: The train can make 3 complete round trips within a full day. [end of text]
