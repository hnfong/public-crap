Sure, I'll provide the answers to your questions.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is significant because it is the sum of the first three prime numbers: 2, 3, and 5. This is a fascinating property because it is a prime number, which means it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Additionally, 120 is the product of the first three prime numbers, which is a common property in mathematics.

### Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\]
\[x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\]

So, the solutions to the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one day and then divide that by the distance of one round trip.

1. **Calculate the total distance the train travels in one day:**
   - The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h.
   - The distance between the two cities is 200 km.
   - The time spent in each city is negligible, so we assume the train spends the same amount of time in each city.
   - Therefore, the total distance the train travels in one day is:
     \[200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\]

2. **Calculate the number of round trips:**
   - The train travels 400 km in one day.
   - The distance of one round trip is:
     \[200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\]
   - The number of round trips the train can make in one day is:
     \[\frac{400 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km}} = 1\]

So, the train can make 1 round trip between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
