Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

I am not sure, but I think the answer is:

Q1: The number 120 is significant because it is the product of two prime numbers, 2 and 60. This makes it a prime number itself, which is a special property in mathematics. Additionally, 120 is the product of two consecutive integers, 12 and 10, which is another interesting property.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions x = 9 and x = -2. Therefore, the equation has two solutions.

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to know the distance between the cities and the train's speed. The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. The time it takes for the train to travel between the cities is 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours. Since a full day is 24 hours, the train can make 24 / 3.33 = 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
