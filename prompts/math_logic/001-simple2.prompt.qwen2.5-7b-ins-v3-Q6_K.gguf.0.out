Alright, I need to address the three questions provided. Let's tackle them one by one, ensuring I cover all aspects thoroughly.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

First, I recall that 120 is a composite number, which means it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Let me think about its factors. 120 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. That's quite a lot of divisors, making 120 a highly composite number. This property makes it useful in various mathematical contexts, such as in geometry and number theory.

Next, 120 is known as the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!. Calculating 5! gives 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Factorials are fundamental in combinatorics, where they represent the number of ways to arrange a set of items. For example, there are 120 possible ways to arrange five distinct books on a shelf.

Another interesting property of 120 is its relationship to the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices. In graph theory, a complete graph with n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges. Plugging in 10 for n, we get 10 × 9 / 2 = 45 edges. Wait, that doesn't match 120. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check: 10 × 9 = 90; 90 / 2 = 45. So, 120 isn't directly related to the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices. Maybe I confused it with another mathematical concept.

Moving on, 120 is also the sum of the first 15 positive integers. Calculating the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, S = n(n+1)/2, where n = 15, we get S = 15 × 16 / 2 = 120. This property makes 120 a triangular number, which has applications in various mathematical problems involving arrangements and distributions.

Additionally, 120 is a Harshad number in base 10, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits. The sum of the digits in 120 is 1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 divided by 3 equals 40, which is an integer. This property is interesting because it highlights the number's divisibility characteristics.

In geometry, 120 is significant in the context of the icosahedron, one of the five Platonic solids. An icosahedron has 120 rotational symmetries, which are the ways the shape can be rotated so that it looks the same as before. This high degree of symmetry makes the icosahedron a fascinating object of study in geometry and crystallography.

Furthermore, 120 appears in various historical and cultural contexts. For instance, in ancient Greece, the number 120 was associated with the number of talents, a unit of weight used in trade and finance. This historical significance adds another layer of interest to the number.

Lastly, 120 is a number that appears in several mathematical puzzles and problems, often serving as a convenient benchmark or a point of reference due to its rich set of properties.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve the quadratic equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0, I'll use the quadratic formula, which is:

x = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2

First, let's calculate the discriminant, which is the part under the square root: 49 + 72 = 121.

So, the equation becomes:

x = [7 ± √121] / 2

Since √121 is 11, the equation simplifies to:

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

Now, I'll calculate both possibilities:

1. x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
2. x = (7 - 11) / 2 = (-4) / 2 = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

First, let's determine the time it takes for the train to travel one way between the two cities. The distance between the cities is 200 km, and the train's average speed is 60 km/h.

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h ≈ 3.333 hours

Since the train makes a round trip, the total time for one round trip is twice this duration:

Total time per round trip = 3.333 hours × 2 ≈ 6.666 hours

Now, we need to find out how many such round trips can be made within a full day, which is 24 hours.

Number of round trips = Total available time / Time per round trip = 24 hours / 6.666 hours ≈ 3.6

Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll consider only the whole number of trips.

Therefore, the train can make **3 full round trips** within a full day.

However, let's double-check this calculation to ensure accuracy.

If the train makes 3 round trips:

Total time = 3 × 6.666 hours ≈ 20 hours

Remaining time = 24 hours - 20 hours = 4 hours

In these remaining 4 hours, the train can make partial preparations or rest, but since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we'll assume it's not utilized for additional trips.

Thus, the final conclusion remains that the train can make **3 full round trips** within a full day.
