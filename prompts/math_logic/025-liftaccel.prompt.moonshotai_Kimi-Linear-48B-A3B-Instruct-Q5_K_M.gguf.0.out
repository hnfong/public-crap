Let's solve each question step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Building has **40 floors**.
- Each floor is **5 meters** tall.
- Lift acceleration/deceleration = **1 m/s²**.
- Maximum speed = **5 m/s**.
- Starts at **1/F (ground floor)**.

---

## **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

### **Step 1: Total distance**
- 40 floors × 5 meters = **200 meters**

### **Step 2: Motion profile**
The lift accelerates at **1 m/s²** until it reaches **5 m/s**, then decelerates at **1 m/s²** to stop at 40/F.

This is a **symmetric acceleration-deceleration profile**, so:
- Time to accelerate to max speed:  
  \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \) seconds
- Distance during acceleration:  
  \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \) meters
- Same for deceleration: 12.5 meters

### **Step 3: Constant speed distance**
- Total distance = 200 m  
- Distance at constant speed = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = **175 meters**
- Time at constant speed = \( \frac{175}{5} = 35 \) seconds

### **Step 4: Total time**
- Acceleration: 5 s  
- Constant speed: 35 s  
- Deceleration: 5 s  
- **Total = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds**

### ✅ **Answer to Question 1: 45 seconds**

## **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

### **Step 1: Determine the stopping pattern**
- The lift must stop at **10/F and 30/F**.
- The **first stop** is at **10/F**, then it continues to **30/F**, then returns to **10/F** (if the first person is getting off), or continues to **40/F** if the second person is getting off.

But the question says:
> First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F.

So the **lift must stop at 10/F first**, then continue to 30/F.

### **Step 2: Motion profile**
- **Acceleration phase**: 5 m/s² → 5 m/s in 5 s, 12.5 m
- **Deceleration phase**: 5 m/s² → stop in 5 s, 12.5 m
- **Constant speed**: 5 m/s

We need to compute the **time to reach 10/F**, then **time from 10/F to 30/F**.

#### **Time to reach 10/F**
- Distance = 10 × 5 = **50 m**
- Accelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m
- Remaining distance = 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 m
- At constant speed: 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 s
- Decelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m (but we don’t need to decelerate yet)

So:
- **Time to reach 10/F** = 5 (accel) + 7.5 (constant) = **12.5 s**

#### **Time from 10/F to 30/F**
- Distance = 20 × 5 = **100 m**
- Accelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m
- Remaining distance = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 m
- At constant speed: 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 s
- Decelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m (but again, we don’t need to decelerate yet)

So:
- **Time from 10/F to 30/F** = 5 + 17.5 = **22.5 s**

### **Step 3: Total time**
- Time to 10/F: 12.5 s  
- Time from 10/F to 30/F: 22.5 s  
- **Total = 12.5 + 22.5 = 35 seconds**

### ✅ **Answer to Question 2: 35 seconds**

## **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

### **Step 1: Understand the constraint**
- The lift must stop at **another floor** between 1/F and 40/F **before reaching 40/F**.
- So the lift must stop at **some floor between 2/F and 39/F**, then continue to 40/F.

### **Step 2: Minimize time**
To **minimize time**, we want to:
- **Minimize the number of stops**
- **Minimize the distance traveled**

So the **best option** is to stop at the **closest possible floor** to 40/F — that is, **39/F**.

### **Step 3: Compute time to 39/F**
- Distance = 39 × 5 = **195 m**
- Accelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m
- Remaining distance = 195 - 12.5 = 182.5 m
- At constant speed: 182.5 / 5 = 36.5 s
- Decelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m (but we don’t need to decelerate yet)

So:
- **Time to reach 39/F** = 5 + 36.5 = **41.5 s**

### **Step 4: Time from 39/F to 40/F**
- Distance = 5 m
- Accelerate for 5 s → 12.5 m (but we only need 5 m)
- So we **accelerate for 1 s**, covering:
  \( s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1^2 = 0.5 \) m
- Remaining distance = 5 - 0.5 = 4.5 m
- At constant speed: 4.5 / 1 = 4.5 s
- Decelerate for 1 s → 0.5 m

So:
- **Time from 39/F to 40/F** = 1 (accel) + 4.5 (constant) + 1 (decel) = **6.5 s**

### **Step 5: Total time**
- Time to 39/F: 41.5 s  
- Time from 39/F to 40/F: 6.5 s  
- **Total = 41.5 + 6.5 = 48 seconds**
