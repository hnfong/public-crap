Okay, let's tackle these elevator problems one by one. First, I need to remember how elevators accelerate and decelerate. The problem says acceleration/deceleration is 1 m/s², max speed 5 m/s. So the elevator will accelerate until it hits max speed, then maybe cruise at that speed, then decelerate to stop. I need to figure out the time for each phase.

Starting with question 1: Ground to 40th floor. Each floor is 5 meters, so total height is 39 floors * 5 meters? Wait, wait. Wait, ground floor is 1/F, top is 40/F. So from 1/F to 40/F, that's 39 intervals between floors. Wait, no. Wait, if each floor is 5 meters tall, then the height from ground (1/F) to 40/F is (40-1)*5 meters? Wait, no. Wait, the building has 40 stories, each 5 meters tall. So the total height from ground to top floor is 40*5 meters? Wait, no. Wait, the ground floor is 1/F, which is the first floor. So the height from ground to 1/F is 0? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the building's height is 40 stories, each 5 meters, so total height is 40*5 = 200 meters. But when going from 1/F to 40/F, the elevator travels 39 intervals of 5 meters each? Wait, no. Wait, if each floor is 5 meters tall, then the distance between 1/F and 2/F is 5 meters, so from 1/F to 40/F, it's 39*5 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall", meaning the height of each floor (like the distance from the floor to the ceiling), but the elevator travels between floors. So the distance between 1/F and 2/F is 5 meters. So from 1/F to 40/F, it's 39*5 = 195 meters. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the total height as 40*5 = 200 meters. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall". So the height of the building is 40 floors * 5 meters per floor = 200 meters. So the elevator goes from ground (1/F) to top (40/F), so it travels 200 meters. Wait, but ground floor is 1/F, so maybe the height from ground to 1/F is 0, and each subsequent floor adds 5 meters. So 1/F is at 0, 2/F at 5m, ..., 40/F at 39*5 = 195m. Wait, that's a common confusion. Let's check standard elevator problems. Usually, the distance from 1st to 2nd floor is 5m, so from 1st to nth floor is (n-1)*5 meters. So from 1/F to 40/F, it's 39*5 = 195 meters. Let's confirm that. If it's a 40-story building, the top floor is 40th, so the elevator has to go up 39 intervals. So 39*5 = 195 meters. So total distance is 195 meters.

Now, the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches max speed 5 m/s, then cruises, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop. So first, find the time to accelerate to max speed. Acceleration a = 1 m/s², initial velocity u = 0, final velocity v = 5 m/s. Time to accelerate: t1 = (v - u)/a = (5 - 0)/1 = 5 seconds. Distance covered during acceleration: s1 = ut + 0.5*a*t² = 0 + 0.5*1*25 = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, deceleration phase: same time and distance, since it's decelerating from 5 m/s to 0 at 1 m/s². So t3 = 5 seconds, s3 = 12.5 meters.

So total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration: 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 meters.

Total distance to cover: 195 meters. So the distance at constant speed: 195 - 25 = 170 meters.

Time at constant speed: t2 = distance / speed = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds.

Total time: t1 + t2 + t3 = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds.

Wait, but let's check if the elevator actually reaches max speed. If the total distance was less than 25 meters, it wouldn't reach max speed, but here 195 > 25, so it does reach max speed. So that's correct.

So question 1 answer is 44 seconds.

Question 2: Two people, first to 10/F, second to 30/F. So the elevator has to go to 10/F, stop, then go to 30/F. Wait, but the problem says "how long does it take?" So the time from ground floor (1/F) to 30/F, but with a stop at 10/F. Wait, but the elevator will go from 1/F to 10/F, stop, then go from 10/F to 30/F. So we need to calculate the time for 1/F to 10/F, then 10/F to 30/F.

First, distance from 1/F to 10/F: 9 intervals *5 = 45 meters.

Distance from 10/F to 30/F: 20 intervals *5 = 100 meters.

Now, for each segment, calculate the time.

First segment: 45 meters.

Check if it reaches max speed. Acceleration phase: 12.5 meters, deceleration 12.5 meters, total 25 meters. 45 > 25, so yes, it will accelerate to 5 m/s, cruise, then decelerate.

Time for first segment: t1 = 5s (accel), t2 = (45 - 25)/5 = 20/5 = 4s (cruise), t3 = 5s (decel). Total: 5+4+5=14s.

Wait, 45 - 25 = 20 meters at 5 m/s, so 20/5=4s. Correct.

Second segment: 100 meters.

Same acceleration/deceleration: 25 meters (12.5 each), so cruise distance 100 -25=75 meters. Cruise time: 75/5=15s. Total time for second segment: 5+15+5=25s.

Total time: 14s (to 10/F) + 25s (to 30/F from 10/F) = 39s.

Wait, but when the elevator stops at 10/F, does it take time to stop and start again? The problem says "how long does it take" from ground floor to 30/F, so the time includes the stop at 10/F. But in elevator problems, the stop time is usually negligible unless specified. The problem doesn't mention stop time, so we can assume it's instantaneous. So the time is just the sum of the two travel times.

Wait, but let's confirm the first segment: 45 meters.

Acceleration: 0 to 5 m/s in 5s, distance 12.5m.

Cruise: 45 - 12.5 -12.5 = 20m, time 20/5=4s.

Deceleration: 5s, 12.5m.

Total 5+4+5=14s. Correct.

Second segment: 100 meters.

Same: 12.5 + 12.5 =25m for accel/decel, so 75m cruise, 75/5=15s. Total 5+15+5=25s.

Total time:14+25=39s.

Question 3: Two people, first to 40/F, second to some other floor between 1/F and 40/F. Need to find the minimum time for the lift to get to 40/F, with a stop at another floor. So the elevator must go from 1/F to some floor X (not 40/F), stop, then go to 40/F. We need to choose X such that the total time is minimized.

Wait, but the problem says "the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor", so the second person goes to X, where X is between 1/F and 40/F, X ≠40/F. So the elevator goes 1/F -> X -> 40/F. We need to find X that minimizes the total time.

To minimize time, we want to minimize the total travel time, which is time from 1/F to X plus time from X to 40/F.

But we need to consider that when going from X to 40/F, the elevator might have to accelerate, cruise, decelerate again. However, if X is chosen such that the elevator doesn't need to decelerate at X (i.e., it's a stop, so it has to decelerate to stop at X, then accelerate again to go to 40/F), but maybe if X is chosen so that the elevator can go from 1/F to X without stopping (but it has to stop at X), so it must decelerate to stop at X, then accelerate again to go to 40/F.

Wait, but the problem says "the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F", so it must stop at X, so it has to decelerate to stop at X, then accelerate again to go to 40/F.

So the total time is time(1->X) + time(X->40/F).

We need to find X (floor number, so distance from 1/F to X is (X-1)*5 meters, and from X to 40/F is (40 - X)*5 meters) that minimizes the sum of the two times.

Let’s denote d1 = (X-1)*5, d2 = (40 - X)*5.

Total distance d1 + d2 = 195 meters, same as question 1.

But the time for each segment depends on d1 and d2.

For each segment, the time is calculated as follows:

For a distance d, the time t(d) is:

If d <= 25 meters (since 2*12.5=25), then the elevator doesn't reach max speed. So it accelerates for t1 = sqrt(2d/a), but wait, no. Wait, if d is less than 25, then it accelerates to some speed v <5, then decelerates. But since acceleration and deceleration are same, the time would be 2*sqrt(2d/a). Wait, let's think.

If the elevator accelerates at 1 m/s² for time t, then decelerates at 1 m/s² for time t, total distance is 0.5*a*t² + 0.5*a*t² = a*t². So d = a*t² => t = sqrt(d/a). So total time is 2*sqrt(d/a). But since a=1, t=2*sqrt(d).

But if d >25, then it accelerates to 5 m/s (5s, 12.5m), cruises for (d -25)/5 seconds, then decelerates (5s, 12.5m), so total time 10 + (d-25)/5.

So for d <=25, t(d) = 2*sqrt(d).

For d >25, t(d) = 10 + (d -25)/5.

Now, we need to find X such that t(d1) + t(d2) is minimized, where d1 =5*(X-1), d2=5*(40 - X).

Let’s let x = X-1, so d1=5x, d2=5*(39 -x), since 40 - X = 40 - (x+1) = 39 -x.

So d1=5x, d2=5*(39 -x).

We need to minimize t(5x) + t(5*(39 -x)).

Let’s consider possible cases.

Case 1: Both d1 and d2 are >25.

So 5x >25 => x>5, and 5*(39 -x) >25 => 39 -x >5 => x <34.

So x between 6 and 33 (since x is integer, floor number).

Then t(d1) =10 + (5x -25)/5 =10 +x -5 =x +5.

Similarly, t(d2)=10 + (5*(39 -x) -25)/5 =10 + (195 -5x -25)/5 =10 + (170 -5x)/5 =10 +34 -x =44 -x.

So total time = (x +5) + (44 -x) =49 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. So if both segments are longer than 25 meters, the total time is 49 seconds, regardless of x.

Case 2: One segment <=25, the other >25.

Suppose d1 <=25, so 5x <=25 =>x <=5.

Then d2=5*(39 -x) >=5*(39 -5)=5*34=170 >25.

So t(d1)=2*sqrt(5x) (since d1=5x <=25).

t(d2)=44 -x (from above, since d2>25).

Total time =2*sqrt(5x) +44 -x.

We need to minimize this for x=1,2,3,4,5 (since X is between 1/F and 40/F, X≠40/F, so X can be 1 to 39, but x=X-1, so x=0 to 38. But x<=5 here).

Let's compute for x=1: 2*sqrt(5*1)=2*sqrt(5)≈4.47, 44 -1=43, total≈47.47.

x=2: 2*sqrt(10)≈6.32, 44-2=42, total≈48.32.

x=3: 2*sqrt(15)≈7.75, 44-3=41, total≈48.75.

x=4: 2*sqrt(20)≈8.94, 44-4=40, total≈48.94.

x=5: 2*sqrt(25)=10, 44-5=39, total=49.

So the minimum in this case is at x=1, total≈47.47s.

Case 3: d2 <=25, so 5*(39 -x) <=25 =>39 -x <=5 =>x >=34.

Then d1=5x >=5*34=170 >25.

t(d1)=x +5 (from case 1).

t(d2)=2*sqrt(5*(39 -x)).

Total time =x +5 +2*sqrt(5*(39 -x)).

Let y=39 -x, so y <=5, x=39 -y.

Total time= (39 -y) +5 +2*sqrt(5y)=44 -y +2*sqrt(5y).

Minimize over y=1,2,3,4,5.

y=1:44 -1 +2*sqrt(5)=43 +4.47≈47.47.

y=2:44-2 +2*sqrt(10)=42 +6.32≈48.32.

y=3:44-3 +2*sqrt(15)=41 +7.75≈48.75.

y=4:44-4 +2*sqrt(20)=40 +8.94≈48.94.

y=5:44-5 +2*sqrt(25)=39 +10=49.

So minimum here is also ≈47.47s at y=1 (x=38).

Case 4: Both d1 and d2 <=25. But d1 +d2=195, so if both <=25, total <=50, but 195>50, impossible. So this case doesn't exist.

Now, the minimum time in cases 2 and 3 is approximately 47.47 seconds, which is less than the 44 seconds in question 1. Wait, but in question 1, there's no stop, so it's 44s. But here, we have to stop at another floor, so the time should be more than 44s. Wait, but according to this, it's less? That can't be right. Wait, no, because in question 1, the elevator goes directly to 40/F, so it's 195 meters. In question 3, the elevator goes to X and then to 40/F, so total distance is still 195 meters, but with a stop. But why would the time be less? Because when you have to stop, you have to decelerate and accelerate again, which adds time. Wait, but according to the calculation, when X is very close to 1/F (x=1, X=2/F), then d1=5*1=5 meters, d2=190 meters.

Wait, let's recalculate for X=2/F (x=1, d1=5 meters).

Time for d1=5 meters:

Since d1=5 <=25, so t(d1)=2*sqrt(5/1)=2*sqrt(5)≈4.47s.

Time for d2=190 meters:

d2=190 >25, so t(d2)=10 + (190 -25)/5=10 +165/5=10+33=43s.

Total time≈4.47+43=47.47s.

But in question 1, the time was 44s. So 47.47s is more than 44s, which makes sense. So the minimum time with a stop is higher than without.

Wait, but in case 1, when both segments are >25, total time is 49s, which is higher than 47.47s. So the minimum is when one segment is short (d1=5m) and the other is long (d2=190m), giving total time≈47.47s.

But let's check if d2=190m is correct. From X=2/F to 40/F: 38 intervals *5=190 meters. Yes.

Now, let's verify the time for d2=190m.

Acceleration: 5s, 12.5m.

Cruise: 190 -25=165m, time=165/5=33s.

Deceleration:5s, 12.5m.

Total time=5+33+5=43s. Correct.

For d1=5m:

The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s², but since it's only 5m, it won't reach max speed. Let's calculate the time.

Distance during acceleration: s = 0.5*a*t². But it has to decelerate as well, so it accelerates for t1, then decelerates for t2, with t1=t2 (since acceleration and deceleration are same).

Total distance: 0.5*a*t1² + 0.5*a*t2² = a*t1² (since t1=t2).

So 5 =1*t1² => t1=√5≈2.236s. Total time=2*t1≈4.472s. Correct.

So total time≈4.472+43=47.472s.

Is there a better X? Let's check X=1/F, but X can't be 1/F because the second person is getting on at ground floor, so X must be between 1/F and 40/F, but not 40/F. If X=1/F, that's the same as not stopping, but the problem says "stop at another floor", so X must be different from 1/F. So X=2/F is the closest possible.

Wait, the problem says "another floor between 1/F and 40/F", so X must be ≥2/F and ≤39/F.

So X=2/F is allowed.

Now, let's check if X=3/F (x=2, d1=10m).

t(d1)=2*sqrt(10)≈6.324s.

d2=185m.

t(d2)=10 + (185-25)/5=10 +160/5=10+32=42s.

Total≈6.324+42=48.324s, which is more than 47.47s.

Similarly, X=39/F (x=38, d1=190m, d2=5m).

t(d1)=43s, t(d2)=4.47s, total≈47.47s.

So the minimum time is approximately 47.47 seconds. But we need to give an exact value.

For X=2/F or X=39/F, the time is 2*sqrt(5) + 43.

But sqrt(5) is irrational, so maybe we need to present it as is, or check if the problem expects a numerical value.

Wait, but let's confirm if the elevator can actually stop at X=2/F. The problem says "stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F", so 2/F is between 1/F and 40/F, so it's allowed.

Is there a case where the elevator doesn't need to decelerate at X? No, because it has to stop at X, so it must decelerate to stop.

Another thing: when going from X to 40/F, the elevator starts from rest at X, so it has to accelerate again. So the time for the second segment is from rest to 40/F, which is the same as the first segment in question 1 but for d2.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Now, the problem says "minimum time", so the answer is 43 + 2*sqrt(5) seconds, which is approximately 47.47 seconds.

But let's check if there's a better X where one segment is exactly 25 meters, but that would be d1=25, so x=5 (d1=25), then d2=170.

t(d1)=10s (since 25 meters, 5s accel, 5s decel), t(d2)=10 + (170-25)/5=10+29=39s. Total=10+39=49s, which is higher than 47.47s.

So the minimum is indeed when one segment is as short as possible (5 meters), giving the minimal additional time from the stop.

Therefore, the minimum time is 2*sqrt(5) + 43 seconds. But let's compute it more precisely.

sqrt(5)≈2.23607, so 2*sqrt(5)≈4.47214, so total≈47.47214 seconds.

But maybe the problem expects an exact form or a rounded value. Since it's a math problem, probably exact form, but let's see.

Wait, but let's check if the problem considers the stop time. The problem says "the lift has to stop at another floor", but doesn't mention stop time, so we assume it's instantaneous, which we did.

So for question 3, the minimum time is 43 + 2√5 seconds, approximately 47.47 seconds.

But let's confirm with X=2/F:

- From 1/F to 2/F: 5 meters.

Time: accelerate for t1, then decelerate for t1 (since it has to stop at 2/F).

Distance: 0.5*1*t1² + 0.5*1*t1² = t1² =5 => t1=√5, total time=2√5≈4.47s.

- From 2/F to 40/F: 38*5=190 meters.

Time: accelerate 5s (12.5m), cruise (190-25)/5=33s, decelerate 5s (12.5m). Total=5+33+5=43s.

Total time=4.47+43=47.47s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answers are:

1. 44 seconds.

2. 39 seconds.

3. 43 + 2√5 seconds (≈47.47 seconds).

### **Question 1: Time to travel from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

- **Total distance**:  
  From 1/F to 40/F, there are $ 39 $ intervals of 5 meters each:  
  $$
  \text{Distance} = 39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
  $$

- **Acceleration and deceleration phases**:  
  - Acceleration: $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, max speed $ v = 5 \, \text{m/s} $  
    Time to reach max speed:  
    $$
    t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
    $$  
    Distance covered during acceleration:  
    $$
    s_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{m}

- **First segment (1/F → 10/F)**:  
  Distance: $ 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{m} $  
  - Acceleration/deceleration: $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $  
  - Cruise distance: $ 45 - 25 = 20 \, \text{m} $

### **Question 3: Minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop at another floor**

- **Objective**: Minimize total time for $ 1/F \rightarrow X \rightarrow 40/F $, where $ X \neq 40/F $.

- **Key insight**: To minimize time, the elevator should make the shortest possible stop (i.e., stop at the closest floor to 1/F or 40/F), as this minimizes the extra time spent accelerating and decelerating.

- **Optimal stop**: Stop at **2/F** (or equivalently **39/F**), which is the closest possible floor to the starting point.

- **Segment 1 (1/F → 2/F)**:  
  Distance: $ 1 \times 5 = 5 \, \text{m} $  
  - Since $ d < 25 \, \text{m} $, the elevator does not reach max speed.  
  - Time:  
    $$
    t_1 = 2 \sqrt{\frac{d}{a}} = 2 \sqrt{5} \approx 4.47 \, \text{s}
    $$

- **Segment 2 (2/F → 40/F)**:  
  Distance: $ 38 \times 5 = 190 \, \text{m} $  
  - Acceleration/deceleration: $ 25 \, \text{m} $  
  - Cruise distance: $ 190 - 25 = 165 \, \text{m} $  
  - Cruise time: $ \frac{165}{5} = 33 \, \text{s} $  
  - Total time: $ 5 + 33 + 5 = 43 \, \text{s} $

- **Total time**:  
  $$
  t_{\text{total}} = 2\sqrt{5} + 43 \approx 4.47 + 43 = 47.47 \, \text{seconds}
  $$
