Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

I'll do my best to answer all the questions. Here are my attempts:

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

Let's break down the journey into three parts: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.

1. Acceleration: The lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s at a rate of 1 m/s^2. To find the time taken to reach the maximum speed, we can use the equation:

a = Δv / Δt

where a = 1 m/s^2, Δv = 5 m/s, and Δt is the time taken to accelerate.

Rearranging the equation to solve for Δt, we get:

Δt = Δv / a
= 5 m/s / 1 m/s^2
= 5 s

So, it takes 5 seconds to accelerate to the maximum speed.

2. Constant speed: The lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s for a certain distance. The total distance traveled is the height of the building, which is:

Height = Number of floors × Height per floor
= 40 floors × 5 m/floor
= 200 m

Since the lift travels at 5 m/s, the time taken to cover this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 200 m / 5 m/s
= 40 s

3. Deceleration: The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s at a rate of 1 m/s^2. This takes the same amount of time as the acceleration phase, which is 5 seconds.

Adding up the times for acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration, we get:

Total time = 5 s + 40 s + 5 s
= 50 s

Therefore, it takes 50 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

Let's break down the journey into three parts: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.

1. Acceleration: Same as before, it takes 5 seconds to accelerate to the maximum speed.

2. Constant speed: The lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s. The distance traveled to reach the 10th floor is:

Distance = Number of floors × Height per floor
= 10 floors × 5 m/floor
= 50 m

Time taken to reach the 10th floor:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 50 m / 5 m/s
= 10 s

The lift stops at the 10th floor, and the first person gets out.

3. Acceleration (again): The lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s again, which takes 5 seconds.

4. Constant speed (again): The lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s to reach the 30th floor. The distance traveled is:

Distance = Number of floors × Height per floor
= 20 floors × 5 m/floor
= 100 m

Time taken to reach the 30th floor:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 100 m / 5 m/s
= 20 s

5. Deceleration: The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, which takes 5 seconds.

Adding up the times, we get:

Total time = 5 s + 10 s + 5 s + 20 s + 5 s
= 45 s

Therefore, it takes 45 seconds for the lift to complete this journey.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

Let's consider the worst-case scenario: the second person gets out at the floor just below the 40th floor, which is the 39th floor.

The journey can be broken down into four parts:

1. Acceleration: Same as before, it takes 5 seconds to accelerate to the maximum speed.

2. Constant speed: The lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s. The distance traveled to reach the 39th floor is:

Distance = Number of floors × Height per floor
= 39 floors × 5 m/floor
= 195 m

Time taken to reach the 39th floor:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 195 m / 5 m/s
= 39 s

The lift stops at the 39th floor, and the second person gets out.

3. Acceleration (again): The lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s again, which takes 5 seconds.

4. Constant speed (again): The lift travels at a constant speed of 5 m/s to reach the 40th floor. The distance traveled is:

Distance = Height per floor
= 5 m

Time taken to reach the 40th floor:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 5 m / 5 m/s
= 1 s

5. Deceleration: The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s, which takes 5 seconds.

Adding up the times, we get:

Total time = 5 s + 39 s + 5 s + 1 s + 5 s
= 55 s

Therefore, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 55 seconds. [end of text]
