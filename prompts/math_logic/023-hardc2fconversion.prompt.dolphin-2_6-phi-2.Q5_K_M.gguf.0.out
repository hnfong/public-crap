"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This statement means that when converting temperatures between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), you simply need to multiply the Celsius value by a specific ratio. In this case, the ratio is 5/9, which can also be represented as 0.5556 when rounded to four decimal places.

To illustrate this concept, let's use an example:

Suppose you want to convert a temperature of 30°C to Fahrenheit.

1. Multiply the Celsius value by the ratio: 30°C × 0.5556 (rounded to four decimal places) = 16.6668°F
2. Invert the resulting decimal value by moving the decimal point one place to the left: 16.6668°F → 16.6668°F → 16.6668°F → 16.6668°F

So, the temperature of 30°C is equal to 86.6668°F when rounded to four decimal places.

The "every  12°C, the digits are inverted" part of the statement means that for every 12°C increase in the temperature, the Fahrenheit value will have the digits inverted. In the example above, if the original temperature was 12°C instead of 30°C, the resulting Fahrenheit value would be approximately -22.2222°F, which is the inverted form of the original Celsius value.
