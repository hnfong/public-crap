"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

That's a helpful trick for remembering approximate conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit! Here's how it works:

**The Rule:**

For every 12-degree increase in Celsius, the digits in the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature are flipped.

**Examples:**

* **0°C = 32°F:**  The digits are already flipped (0 and 32).
* **12°C = 54°F:**  Flip the digits of 12, and you get 21.  54 is close to 50 (which is 10°C).
* **24°C = 75°F:** Flip the digits of 24, and you get 42. 75 is close to 72 (which is 22°C).

**Important Notes:**

* **Approximation:** This rule is a simplification and doesn't give you exact conversions. The actual conversion formula is more complex.
* **Starting Point:** The rule works best when starting at 0°C (32°F).

**Why it Works (Sort of):**

The relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit isn't linear, but this trick captures a rough pattern. The Fahrenheit scale increases faster than the Celsius scale, and this flipping pattern reflects that difference.
