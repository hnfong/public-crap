That's a helpful trick for remembering approximate conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit! Here's how it works:

**The Rule:**

For every 12-degree increase in Celsius, the digits in the Fahrenheit equivalent are flipped.

**Examples:**

* **0°C:**  This is 32°F. Notice the digits are the same.
* **12°C:** This is approximately 54°F (digits flipped from 12).
* **24°C:** This is approximately 76°F (digits flipped from 24).
* **36°C:** This is approximately 97°F (digits flipped from 36).

**Important Notes:**

* **Approximation:** This rule provides a rough estimate. The actual conversion isn't perfectly precise due to the way the scales are defined.
* **Starting Point:** The rule works best when starting at 0°C (32°F).
