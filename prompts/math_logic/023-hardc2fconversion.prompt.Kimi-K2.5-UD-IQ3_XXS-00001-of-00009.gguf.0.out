The user is asking about a mnemonic or rule for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit: "every 12°C, the digits are inverted." 

Let me think about this. The standard conversion formula is:
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
or
°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9

Now, what does "digits are inverted" mean? It probably means that if you have a temperature like 12°C, it converts to roughly 54°F (not quite inverted digits). Or maybe it means that at certain points, the digits swap places?

Let me check some conversions:
- 0°C = 32°F
- 12°C = 53.6°F ≈ 54°F (not quite inverted digits)
- 21°C = 69.8°F ≈ 70°F (21 inverted is 12, not 70)
- 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F (16 inverted is 61... hey!)
- 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F (28 inverted is 82!)
- 4°C = 39.2°F (not an inversion)
- -4°C = 24.8°F (not an inversion)

Wait, let me check the pattern more carefully.

If 16°C ≈ 61°F, that's digit inversion.
If 28°C ≈ 82°F, that's digit inversion.

Difference between 16 and 28 is 12.
16 + 12 = 28.

Let me check another:
- 4°C = 39.2°F ≈ 39°F (not quite 93, but close to 40 which isn't 04...)
- -8°C = 17.6°F (not an inversion)

Wait, let's check:
16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F (16 → 61)
28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F (28 → 82)

Difference is 12°C.

Next would be:
28 + 12 = 40°C = 104°F (not 04 or 40 inverted... 40 inverted is 04, but 104 is not 04)

Wait, 40°C = 104°F. If we ignore the 100, we get 04, which is 40 inverted? That's a stretch.

Let me check backwards:
16 - 12 = 4°C = 39.2°F ≈ 39°F (4 inverted is not 39... but 4°C is roughly 40°F, and 04 inverted is 40!)

So:
4°C ≈ 40°F (04 ↔ 40)
16°C ≈ 61°F (16 ↔ 61)
28°C ≈ 82°F (28 ↔ 82)
40°C = 104°F (40 ↔ 04, if we consider it 104 and take the last two digits?)

Actually, looking at the pattern:
4°C = 39.2°F ≈ 40°F
16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F  
28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F

The pattern seems to be that every 12°C, you get roughly the digit-reversed Fahrenheit temperature.

4°C ≈ 40°F (digits of 4 are just "4", reversed is "4", but 40 has digits 4 and 0... maybe not)

Actually, looking at it:
- 4°C ≈ 40°F (if we consider 4 as 04, then 04 → 40)
- 16°C ≈ 61°F (16 → 61)
- 28°C ≈ 82°F (28 → 82)
- 40°C = 104°F (40 → 04, and 104 ends in 04?)

Or maybe it's about the approximate values:
- 4°C ≈ 40°F
- 16°C ≈ 61°F
- 28°C ≈ 82°F

Yes! These are the "digit inversions" (more or less).

4°C ≈ 40°F (4 and 40... if we pad with zero: 04 and 40)
16°C ≈ 61°F (16 and 61)
28°C ≈ 82°F (28 and 82)

And the differences:
16 - 4 = 12
28 - 16 = 12
40 - 28 = 12

So every 12°C, you get a temperature where the Fahrenheit value is approximately the digit-reversed Celsius value.

Let me verify:
- 4°C: (4 × 9/5) + 32 = 7.2 + 32 = 39.2 ≈ 40°F ✓ (04 ↔ 40)
- 16°C: (16 × 9/5) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8 ≈ 61°F ✓ (16 ↔ 61)
- 28°C: (28 × 9/5) + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4 ≈ 82°F ✓ (28 ↔ 82)
- 40°C: (40 × 9/5) + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104°F (40 ↔ 04, and 104 contains 04 at the end)

So the rule is saying that if you know that 16°C ≈ 61°F, then you know that 28°C ≈ 82°F, 4°C ≈ 40°F, etc.

This is actually a pretty clever approximation mnemonic!

So to explain:
1. The "digit inversion" means that the Celsius and Fahrenheit numbers are digit reverses of each other (like 16 and 61, or 28 and 82).
2. This happens approximately every 12°C.
3. The key reference points are roughly:
   - 4°C ≈ 40°F (04 ↔ 40)
   - 16°C ≈ 61°F (16 ↔ 61)
   - 28°C ≈ 82°F (28 ↔ 82)
   - 40°C ≈ 104°F (40 ↔ 04)

Wait, I should double-check the math on these to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Calculation check:
- 4°C: (4 × 1.8) + 32 = 7.2 + 32 = 39.2 ≈ 39°F (close to 40, but not exact)
- 16°C: (16 × 1.8) + 32 = 28.8 + 32 = 60.8 ≈ 61°F (very close)
- 28°C: (28 × 1.8) + 32 = 50.4 + 32 = 82.4 ≈ 82°F (very close)
- 40°C: (40 × 1.8) + 32 = 72 + 32 = 104°F (40 reversed is 04, not obviously present but 104 ends in 04)

Actually, 4°C = 39.2°F which rounds to 39°F, not 40°F. But 39 is close to 40, and 40 is the inversion of 04.

So the pattern holds reasonably well for 16→61 and 28→82, and less perfectly for 4→40.

But wait, is there a better starting point?
- 5°C = 41°F (not an inversion)
- 6°C = 42.8°F ≈ 43°F (not an inversion)
- ...
- 15°C = 59°F (not 51)
- 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F (yes!)
- 17°C = 62.6°F ≈ 63°F (not 71)

So 16°C is definitely the sweet spot.

And 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F.

And 4°C = 39.2°F ≈ 39°F, which is close to 40°F.

So the rule is approximately correct, and useful as a mnemonic.

I should present this clearly with examples showing the pattern.

Structure of answer:
1. Explain what "digits are inverted" means (e.g., 16 becomes 61)
2. Show the pattern every 12°C: 4°C≈40°F, 16°C≈61°F, 28°C≈82°F, 40°C≈104°F
3. Explain how to use this for estimation
4. Note that it's approximate, not exact

Let me verify once more that I haven't missed something. Could "inverted" mean something else? Like upside down? No, that would be 6 and 9, not relevant here. Could it mean 1/x? No, that doesn't make sense for temperature.

So yes, "inverted" means digit reversal (16 → 61).

Final check of the examples:
- 4°C = 39.2°F ≈ 40°F (04 reversed is 40)
- 16°C = 60.8°F ≈ 61°F (16 reversed is 61)
- 28°C = 82.4°F ≈ 82°F (28 reversed is 82)
- 40°C = 104°F (40 reversed is 04, and 104 ends with 04)

The pattern holds well enough for a memory trick.

I should also mention that this is an approximation, not exact math, but useful for quick mental conversion.

Actually, looking at the pattern:
- 4°C ≈ 40°F (difference: 36)
- 16°C ≈ 61°F (difference: 45)
- 28°C ≈ 82°F (difference: 54)
- 40°C = 104°F (difference: 64)

The differences are increasing by 9 each time, which makes sense because 12°C × 9/5 = 21.6°F increase every step, and the digit reversal pattern shifts by roughly that much.

Anyway, the explanation is straightforward.This is a mnemonic trick for approximating Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions. **"Digits are inverted" means the digits of the Celsius temperature are reversed to get the Fahrenheit temperature** (e.g., 16 becomes 61, 28 becomes 82).

The trick works because every 12°C, the conversion roughly produces the digit-reversed number:

| Celsius | Actual Fahrenheit | Approximation | "Inverted" Digits |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **4°C** | 39°F | ≈ **40°F** | 04 ↔ 40 |
| **16°C** | 61°F | ≈ **61°F** | 16 ↔ 61 |
| **28°C** | 82°F | ≈ **82°F** | 28 ↔ 82 |
| **40°C** | 104°F | ≈ **104°F** | 40 ↔ 04 (last two digits) |

### How to use this:
If you memorize that **16°C ≈ 61°F**, you can add or subtract 12°C to find other "inverted" pairs:
*   **16°C + 12°C = 28°C** → **82°F** (28 reversed)
*   **16°C − 12°C = 4°C** → **40°F** (04 reversed)

### Why it works (briefly):
The conversion formula is $F = (C \times 1.8) + 32$. When you increase C by 12, F increases by $12 \times 1.8 = 21.6°F$. This ~22-degree jump happens to shift the digits into their reversed positions at these specific intervals.

**Important caveat:** This is a memory aid, not exact mathematics. It works perfectly at 16°C and 28°C, but 4°C is actually 39°F (close enough to 40°F for estimation). For temperatures in between these 12-degree intervals, you must interpolate. [end of text]
