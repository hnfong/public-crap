### What it means

The statement is a memory trick for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It suggests that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature “swap places.” In other words, if you have a Celsius temperature that is a multiple of 12, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will have its digits reversed.

### How it works

The exact conversion formula is:

```
F = (C × 9/5) + 32
```

But the trick works for specific Celsius values that are multiples of 12. For example:

- 0°C → 32°F (digits: 0 and 32 → not a swap, but 32 is the starting point)
- 12°C → 54°F (digits: 12 → 21 → 54°F? Wait, that doesn't match. Let's check the math.)

Let's calculate 12°C to Fahrenheit:

```
F = (12 × 9/5) + 32 = (108/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F
```

That doesn't match the trick. So the trick might be flawed or only works for specific cases.

### Let's try 24°C

```
F = (24 × 9/5) + 32 = (216/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F
```

Again, not a digit swap.

### What about 36°C?

```
F = (36 × 9/5) + 32 = (324/5) + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8°F
```

Still not.

### Maybe it's for negative temperatures?

Let's try -12°C:

```
F = (-12 × 9/5) + 32 = (-108/5) + 32 = -21.6 + 32 = 10.4°F
```

Not a swap.

### Clarification

The trick might be referring to a different set of temperatures. Let me think of temperatures where the digits are reversed.

For example, 16°C is 60.8°F (not a swap). 20°C is 68°F (digits: 20 → 02? 68°F? Not a swap).

Wait, what about 28°C? 28°C is 82.4°F. Digits: 28 → 82? But 82.4 is not exactly 82.

### A known pair

There is a famous pair: 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F. The digits are not swapped, but 32 and 212 are related.

Another pair: 40°C = 104°F. Digits: 40 → 04? 104°F? Not a swap.

### Conclusion

The trick as stated is not accurate for every 12°C. It might be a misremembering or a specific example that was intended. The correct way to convert is to use the formula.

### Example of a correct conversion

- 0°C = 32°F
- 10°C = 50°F
- 20°C = 68°F
- 30°C = 86°F
- 40°C = 104°F

None of these have digit swaps.

### Final note

If you have a specific example in mind, please provide it, and I can explain why the digits might appear swapped in that case. Otherwise, the trick is not reliable. [end of text]
