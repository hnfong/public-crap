We are given the numbers: **4, 3, 1, 8**, and must use **each exactly once** to make **24** using basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷, parentheses).

Let’s systematically try combinations.

---

Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16 → not 24. Retrying.

Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27 → not 24. Retrying.

Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4*5 + 4 = 24 → but used 4 twice, didn’t use 1. Invalid. Retrying.

Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24 → uses 8,4,3,1 → all correct!

Double checking:  
(8 + 4) = 12  
(3 - 1) = 2  
12 * 2 = 24  
Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1 → exactly the given numbers.

Perfect.

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1) — correct.
```

✅ Success.

Final answer:

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1) — correct.
