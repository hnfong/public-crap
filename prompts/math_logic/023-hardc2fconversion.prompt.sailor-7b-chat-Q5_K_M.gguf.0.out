"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

assistant
This sentence means that when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can remember the formula by reversing the last two digits of the Fahrenheit temperature. For example, if you are converting 32°C to Fahrenheit, you can add 32 to 12 and get 44. The last two digits of 44 are 44, so you can say that 42°C is equal to 44°F. Similarly, if you are converting 96°F to Celsius, you can subtract 96 from 12 and get 84. The last two digits of 84 are 84, so you can say that 84°F is equal to 84°C.
