Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

1. To find the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration and deceleration of the lift.

The lift accelerates from 0 m/s to 5 m/s in 5 seconds (since its maximum speed is 5 m/s). Then, it maintains this speed for 35 floors (40 - 5). After that, it decelerates from 5 m/s to 0 m/s in 5 seconds.

So, the total time taken is:

Time = Time to accelerate + Time at constant speed + Time to decelerate
Time = 5s + (35 * 5s) + 5s
Time = 5s + 175s + 5s
Time = 185s

It takes 185 seconds (or 3 minutes and 5 seconds) for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

2. For the first person to go to 10/F and the second person to go to 30/F, we need to consider the time taken for each person to reach their respective floors.

First person:
Time = (10 - 1) * 5s = 45s

Second person:
Time = (30 - 1) * 5s = 145s

Total time = 45s + 145s = 190s

It takes 190 seconds (or 3 minutes and 10 seconds) for both people to reach their respective floors.

3. For the second person to go to a floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to consider the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F.

Let's assume the second person gets off at floor x. The lift will then accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s in 5 seconds, then decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s in 5 seconds.

The time taken for the lift to reach floor x is:

Time = Time to accelerate + Time at constant speed + Time to decelerate
Time = 5s + (x - 1) * 5s + 5s

Since the lift has to stop at floor x, the time taken for the lift to reach floor x is equal to the time taken for the second person to reach their floor.

Time = 190s (from question 2)

Now, we can solve for x:

5s + (x - 1) * 5s + 5s = 190s
5s + 5s(x - 1) + 5s = 190s
5s + 5sx - 5s + 5s = 190s
5sx = 190s - 10s
5sx = 180s
x = 180s / 5s
x = 36

The minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F is 190 seconds (or 3 minutes and 10 seconds). [end of text]
