Okay, let's see. I need to make 24 using the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8. Each number has to be used exactly once, right? Let me think about possible combinations.

First, maybe I should list out all the numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8. Hmm. Let's try different operations. Maybe multiplication and division could help reach 24.

Wait, 24 can be made from 8 * 3, which is 24. But then I still have 4 and 1 left. If I do 8 * 3 * (4 - 1), that would be 24 * 3 = 72, which is too big. Not helpful.

What if I subtract or add something. Let's see. 8 * 3 is 24, but I need to use all four numbers. So maybe 8 * 3 * (something with 4 and 1). Wait, but 4 and 1... If I do (8 - (4 - 3)) * something. Wait, maybe not.

Another approach: 24 is 6 * 4. So if I can make 6 from 3, 1, 8. Let's see. 8 - (3 - 1) = 8 - 2 = 6. Then 6 * 4 = 24. Wait, that uses 8, 3, 1, and 4. Let's check:

(8 - (3 - 1)) * 4 = (8 - 2) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24. Yes! Let's verify the numbers: 8, 3, 1, 4. All used once. So the expression would be (8 - (3 - 1)) * 4.

Wait, but let's compute it step by step. 3 - 1 is 2. 8 - 2 is 6. 6 * 4 is 24. Perfect. So that works.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. Let's see.

Another idea: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24. But how to get 2 from 8 and 1. 8 / (1 + something). Wait, 8 / (1 + 3) is 2, but that would use 8,1,3. Then 4 * 3 * (8/(1+3)) but that's using 3 twice. Not allowed.

Wait, maybe (8 / (4 - (3 - 1)))? Let's see. 3 -1 is 2. 4 - 2 is 2. 8 / 2 is 4. Then 4 * something? Not sure.

Wait, back to the first idea. (8 - (3 - 1)) * 4. Let's write it as (8 - 3 + 1) * 4. Because 8 - (3 -1) is 8 -3 +1. So 8 -3 is 5, plus 1 is 6. 6 *4=24. Yes. So that's correct.

Wait, but the problem says to use each number once. So 8, 3, 1, 4. All used once. So that's valid.

Wait, but let me check if the parentheses are correct. Let's compute it again:

First, 3 - 1 = 2.

Then 8 - 2 = 6.

Then 6 * 4 = 24. Yes. So the expression is (8 - (3 - 1)) * 4.

Alternatively, written as (8 - 3 + 1) * 4. But order of operations would make it 8 - (3 -1) = 8 -3 +1, which is same as 6.

Another way: 4 * (8 - 3 + 1) = 4 * 6 =24. Yes.

Wait, but let's check if all numbers are used. 4, 8, 3, 1. Yes. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the previous attempts the user tried some wrong ones. Let me make sure this is correct.

Wait, the user's example had an attempt like 8*3 +4 -1=27, which was wrong. So my solution here should be correct.

Wait, let's check another possible combination. How about (4 - 1) * (8 - 3) = 3 *5=15. Not 24.

Or 8 * (4 - (3 -1)) = 8*(4-2)=8*2=16. No.

Wait, 3 * 8 * (4 / (1 + something)). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: 8 * 3 =24, but need to use 4 and 1. Maybe 8 * 3 * (4/4), but we don't have two 4s. Wait, we have 4,3,1,8. So 4/ (something). Wait, 8 * 3 * (1) + (4-4), but no, can't reuse numbers.

Wait, maybe (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) =4*4=16. Which was the first attempt. Not 24.

Wait, so the correct one seems to be (8 - (3 -1)) *4. Let's write that as (8 -3 +1)*4. So 6*4=24.

Alternatively, 4*(8 -3 +1)=24.

Yes. Let's confirm:

Numbers used: 4,8,3,1. All present once.

Operations: subtraction, addition, multiplication.

So the expression is 4 × (8 - 3 + 1) = 24.

Wait, but let's compute it step by step:

8 -3 =5, 5 +1=6, 6*4=24. Correct.

Alternatively, 8 - (3 -1) =8-2=6, then 6*4=24.

Yes. So this should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. Let's see.

What about (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) =12 *2=24. Wait, that's another possibility!

Wait, 4 +8 is 12, 3-1 is 2. 12*2=24. Oh! That's a simpler way.

Wait, numbers used: 4,8,3,1. All used once. So (4 +8) * (3 -1) =12 *2=24.

Yes! That's a better solution. Let me check:

4 +8 =12, 3-1=2, 12*2=24. Perfect.

So why didn't I think of that earlier? That's a more straightforward expression.

So the correct expression is (4 + 8) × (3 - 1) =24.

Let me verify:

4 +8 =12

3 -1=2

12 *2=24. Yes.

All numbers used exactly once. So this is a valid solution.

Wait, so why did I think of the other one first? This one is simpler.

So the answer should be (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) =24.

Let me check if this is correct. Yes.

So the user's previous attempts didn't consider this. Let's see.

In the problem statement, the user's example had an attempt like (8-4)*(3+1)=16, which is wrong. Then another attempt that was wrong. So the correct answer here is (4 +8)*(3 -1).

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's compute:

(4 + 8) =12

(3 -1)=2

12 *2=24. Correct.

Yes, this works. So this is the correct expression.

I think this is the right answer. Let me check if there are other possibilities, but this seems to work.

Another way: 8 * (3) * (4 - 3) * something, but no. Wait, 8*3=24, but need to use 4 and 1. If I do 8*3*(4/4), but that uses 4 twice. Not allowed.

So the (4+8)*(3-1) is the correct one.

Wait, but let's check if the order of operations is correct. Parentheses first, so yes.

So the correct expression is (4 + 8) × (3 - 1) =24.

So the answer should be that.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations. Let's see.

Another idea: 8 * (4 - (3 -1)) =8*(4-2)=8*2=16. No.

Or 3 * (8 - (4 / 1)) =3*(8-4)=3*4=12. No.

How about (8 - 4) * (3 * 2), but we don't have a 2. Wait, 3-1=2. So (8-4)*(3*(3-1)), but that uses 3 twice. Not allowed.

Wait, no. So the (4+8)*(3-1) is the way to go.

Yes, this seems correct. So the correct answer is (4 + 8) × (3 - 1) =24.

```
Attempt: (4 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (4 + 8) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 1), which is correct.
