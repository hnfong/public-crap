### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Significance and Properties of 120:**

1. **Factorial Connection**:  
   - 120 is the factorial of 5, denoted as \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).  
   - Factorials are fundamental in combinatorics (counting arrangements) and probability.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   - 120 has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are:  
     \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120\) (16 divisors).  
   - This makes it useful in scenarios requiring flexibility in grouping or partitioning (e.g., time units: 120 seconds = 2 minutes, 120 minutes = 2 hours).

3. **Mathematical Properties**:  
   - **Sum of First Four Factorials**: \(1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33\), but \(5! = 120\) marks a leap in factorial growth.  
   - **Abundant Number**: The sum of its proper divisors (\(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 60 = 240\)) exceeds 120.  
   - **Harshad Number**: Divisible by the sum of its digits (\(1 + 2 + 0 = 3\); \(120 รท 3 = 40\)).

4. **Geometric and Real-World Applications**:  
   - **Regular Icosahedron**: Has 120 rotational symmetries.  
   - **Time**: 120 is a multiple of 60 (base of timekeeping), appearing in conversions (e.g., 2 hours = 120 minutes).  
   - **Sports**: A basketball game has four 12-minute quarters (48 minutes total), but 120 minutes is the duration of a soccer match including halftime.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Solution:**

We solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]  
where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. **Compute the discriminant**:  
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121.
   \]

2. **Take the square root of the discriminant**:  
   \[
   \sqrt{\Delta} = \sqrt{121} = 11.
   \]

3. **Apply the quadratic formula**:  
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}.
   \]

4. **Find the two solutions**:  
   - \(x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9\),  
   - \(x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\).

**Final Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2}
\]

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time for one one-way trip**:  
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.333 \text{ hours}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the time for one round trip**:  
   A round trip consists of two one-way trips:  
   \[
   \text{Round Trip Time} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.666 \text{ hours}.
   \]

3. **Determine the number of round trips in 24 hours**:  
   \[
   \text{Number of Round Trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/round trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6.
   \]  
   Since the train cannot complete a fraction of a round trip, we take the integer part: **3 full round trips**.

4. **Verification**:  
   - Time for 3 round trips: \(3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20\) hours.  
   - Remaining time: \(24 - 20 = 4\) hours, which is insufficient for another round trip (\(\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.666\) hours needed).

**Final Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{3}
