Q1: 1 + 1 = **2**

Q2: 6 × 7 = **42**

Q3: 83 × 59 =  
83 × 59 = 83 × (60 - 1) = (83 × 60) - 83 = 4980 - 83 = **4897**

Q4: 349 × 683  
Let’s compute it step by step:  
349 × 683 = 349 × (700 - 17) = (349 × 700) - (349 × 17)  
349 × 700 = 349 × 7 × 100 = (2443) × 100 = 244,300  
349 × 17 = (350 × 17) - (1 × 17) = 5950 - 17 = 5933  
So, 244,300 - 5,933 = **238,367**

Q5: 6043 × 7489  
This is a large multiplication. Let's compute it carefully:  
We can use approximation or direct multiplication, but since it's large, I’ll compute it step by step using standard multiplication.

Alternatively, use known method or calculator-style approach:

6043 × 7489  
= (6000 + 43) × (7500 - 11)  
But this may get messy. Instead, use direct multiplication or known value.

Actually, let me compute it properly:

6043 × 7489  
We can break it down:

6043 × 7000 = 42,301,000  
6043 × 400 = 2,417,200  
6043 × 80 = 483,440  
6043 × 9 = 54,387  

Now add them:

42,301,000  
+ 2,417,200 = 44,718,200  
+ 483,440 = 45,201,640  
+ 54,387 = **45,256,027**

✅ So, 6043 × 7489 = **45,256,027**

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22  
Subtract 7 from both sides:  
3x = 15  
Divide by 3:  
x = **5**

Q7: What is 25% of 80?  
25% = 1/4  
80 ÷ 4 = **20**

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two $20 bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional $5 bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?

- You pay: two $20 bills = $40  
- Book costs $15  
- So, total due = $15  
- You give $40, so you should get $25 back  
- But you *add* a $5 bill — that means you gave $40 + $5 = $45  
- So, the shopkeeper should give you $45 - $15 = **$30** in change

Wait — this seems odd. Let's re-read:

> "I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill."

This suggests that initially, you gave two $20 bills ($40), and she didn’t have change, so you *added* a $5 bill — meaning you gave $45 total.

So total payment = $45  
Book costs $15  
Change due = $45 - $15 = **$30**

✅ Final change = **$30**

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.  
Perimeter = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = **20 units**

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?  
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 4 children  
So, her mother has **4 children**

Q11: Evaluate the expression: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1  
Order of operations: division first  
12 ÷ 4 = 3  
So: 3 + 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = **5**

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?  
The question does not specify how many slices per person.  
No standard assumption is given.  
So, without more information, we cannot determine the number of slices.

❌ **I am not sure, but I think the answer is** "not enough information"

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?  
20% of 25 = 0.20 × 25 = $5  
Sale price = 25 - 5 = **$20**

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?  
From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM:

- From 3:45 to 4:00 = 15 minutes  
- 4:00 to 5:00 = 60 minutes  
- 5:00 to 6:00 = 60 minutes  
- 6:00 to 6:30 = 30 minutes  

Total = 15 + 60 + 60 + 30 = **165 minutes**

✅ Answer: **165 minutes**

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?  
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5  
Since you can't have half a taxi, round up to **6 taxis**

✅ Answer: **6**

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?  
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°  
Third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = 180 - 93 = **87 degrees**

✅ Answer: **87°**
