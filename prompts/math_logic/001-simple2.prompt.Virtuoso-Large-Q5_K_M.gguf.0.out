Sure, let's go through each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

1. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5, i.e., \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

2. **Highly Composite**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The divisors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

3. **Sum of Consecutive Integers**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of the first 15 positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 15 = 120\).

4. **Triangular Number**: 120 is the 15th triangular number, which means it can be represented as a triangle with 15 rows of dots.

5. **Pentagonal Number**: 120 is also a pentagonal number, specifically the 10th pentagonal number.

6. **Sum of Squares**: 120 can be expressed as the sum of four squares in several ways, such as \(120 = 10^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 0^2\).

7. **Historical and Cultural Significance**: In some cultures, 120 is considered a significant number. For example, in the Bible, it is mentioned that Moses lived to be 120 years old.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. **Find the square root of the discriminant**:
   \[ \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. **Apply the quadratic formula**:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. **Solve for the two roots**:
   \[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   \[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions to the equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip**:
   - Distance for one round trip: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\)
   - Speed: \(60 \text{ km/h}\)
   - Time for one round trip: \(\frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day**:
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - Number of round trips: \(\frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/round trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\)

Since the train cannot make a partial round trip, we take the integer part of 3.6, which is 3.

So, the train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
