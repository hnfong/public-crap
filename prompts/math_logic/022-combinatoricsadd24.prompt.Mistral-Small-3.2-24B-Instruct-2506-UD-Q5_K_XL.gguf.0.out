```
Attempt: (8 / (4 - 3)) + 1 = 8 / 1 + 1 = 9, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (3 + 1) * (8 - 4) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 * 1 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 + 3) * (8 - 1) = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3 / 1)) = 8 * (4 - 3) = 8 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 * 3) / (4 / 1) = 24 / 4 = 6, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 4 * 4 + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24
Double checking: (4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 4 * 4 + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 3, 1, 8), which is correct.
```

The correct mathematical expression is: (4 * (3 + 1)) + 8 = 24. [end of text]
