Okay, let's break down these lift problems step-by-step. This is going to involve some physics calculations (kinematics) and a bit of logical thinking.

**Understanding the Problem**

*   **Total Height:** 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters
*   **Acceleration/Deceleration:** 1 m/s²
*   **Max Speed:** 5 m/s

**Question 1: Ground Floor to Top Floor (40/F)**

This is the simplest case. The lift accelerates to max speed, travels at max speed for a while, then decelerates to stop.

1.  **Acceleration Phase:**
    *   Time to reach max speed (5 m/s) at 1 m/s²:  t = v/a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during acceleration: d = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters

2.  **Constant Speed Phase:**
    *   Remaining distance: 200 meters - 12.5 meters - 12.5 meters = 175 meters (we subtract 12.5m for deceleration at the end)
    *   Time at constant speed: t = d/v = 175 meters / 5 m/s = 35 seconds

3.  **Deceleration Phase:**
    *   Time to decelerate from 5 m/s at 1 m/s²: t = v/a = 5 m/s / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during deceleration: d = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters

4.  **Total Time:** 5 seconds (acceleration) + 35 seconds (constant speed) + 5 seconds (deceleration) = **45 seconds**

**Question 2: Person 1 to 10/F, Person 2 to 30/F**

This is trickier. The lift has to stop twice. We'll assume the stops are instantaneous for simplicity (in reality, there's a small delay, but we'll ignore that).

1.  **Ground to 10/F:**
    *   Height: 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters
    *   Acceleration Phase: Same as before, 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Remaining distance: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters
    *   If 37.5m is less than the distance traveled at max speed (5m/s * 5s = 25m), then the lift will not reach max speed.
    *   Time at constant speed: t = d/v = 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds
    *   Total time to 10/F: 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 seconds

2.  **10/F to 30/F:**
    *   Height: 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters
    *   Acceleration Phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Remaining distance: 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters
    *   Time at constant speed: t = d/v = 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds
    *   Deceleration Phase: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Total time to 30/F: 5 + 17.5 + 5 = 27.5 seconds

3.  **Total Time:** 12.5 + 27.5 = **40 seconds**

**Question 3: Person 1 to 40/F, Person 2 to Some Other Floor (Not 40/F)**

We want to *minimize* the total time. This means the second person must get off at the floor that causes the least delay. The best strategy is to have the second person get off *right before* the lift would have started decelerating for the 40th floor.

1.  **Ground to 40/F (Without the Second Person):**  We already calculated this in Question 1: 45 seconds.

2.  **Second Person's Stop:** Let's say the second person gets off at floor *x* (where 1 < x < 40).  The lift accelerates to 5 m/s, travels at 5 m/s, then decelerates.  To minimize the delay, the second person should get off just before the deceleration phase.

3.  **Optimal Stop Point:** The lift travels at max speed for the longest possible time. The second person gets off at floor *x* such that the remaining distance to 40/F is just enough for the deceleration phase.

4.  **Height to Floor x:** Let's say the second person gets off at floor *x*. The height to floor *x* is 5x meters.

5.  **Remaining Distance:** 200 - 5x meters.

6.  **Time to Floor x:**
    *   Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Remaining distance: 5x - 12.5 meters.
    *   Time at constant speed: (5x - 12.5) / 5 seconds.
    *   Total time to floor x: 5 + (5x - 12.5) / 5 = 5 + x - 2.5 = x + 2.5 seconds.

7.  **Time from Floor x to 40/F:**
    *   Acceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Remaining distance: 200 - 5x - 12.5 meters.
    *   Time at constant speed: (200 - 5x - 12.5) / 5 seconds.
    *   Deceleration: 5 seconds, 12.5 meters.
    *   Total time from floor x to 40/F: 5 + (200 - 5x - 12.5) / 5 + 5 = 10 + (187.5 - 5x) / 5 = 10 + 37.5 - x = 47.5 - x seconds.

8.  **Total Time:** (x + 2.5) + (47.5 - x) = **50 seconds**

**Important Note:** The 50-second answer assumes the second person gets off at a floor that allows the lift to accelerate back to max speed before decelerating for the 40th floor. If the second person gets off at a floor that forces the lift to decelerate immediately, the total time will be longer.

**Final Answers:**

1.  **45 seconds**
2.  **40 seconds**
3.  **50 seconds** (assuming the second person gets off at a floor that allows the lift to accelerate back to max speed before decelerating for the 40th floor)

Let me know if you'd like me to refine any of these calculations or explore different scenarios! [end of text]
