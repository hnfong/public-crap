<think>First, I need to answer each question one by one. If I'm not sure, I can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..." but for most of these, I should be confident since they're basic math or logic problems.

Let's start with Q1: 1+1=?

This is straightforward. 1+1=2. So, I'll say 2.

Q2: 6*7=?

6 times 7 is 42. So, 42.

Q3: 83*59=?

I need to multiply 83 and 59. Let me calculate that. 83 * 59. I can do 83 * 60 - 83 * 1 = 4980 - 83 = 4897. So, 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?

This is a larger multiplication. I'll multiply 349 and 683. I can break it down. 349 * 600 = 209400, 349 * 80 = 27920, 349 * 3 = 1047. Now add them: 209400 + 27920 = 237320, then 237320 + 1047 = 238367. So, 238367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?

This is even larger. I might need to use a calculator, but since I'm supposed to answer, I'll try to compute it. But if I'm not sure, I can say I'm not sure. Let me see if I can estimate or compute accurately. 6043 * 7489. I can do 6043 * 7000 = 42301000, 6043 * 400 = 2417200, 6043 * 80 = 483440, 6043 * 9 = 54387. Now add them: 42301000 + 2417200 = 44718200, then 44718200 + 483440 = 45201640, then 45201640 + 54387 = 45256027. So, 45256027. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll say I think the answer is 45256027.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15, then divide by 3: x = 5. So, x=5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?

25% is one fourth, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So, 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?

I give two $20 bills, so that's $40. The book costs $15, so she should give me change from $40. But since she doesn't have exact change, I give her an additional $5 bill. So now I have given her $40 + $5 = $45. The book costs $15, so she should give me back $45 - $15 = $30. But let me think carefully. I initially give two $20 bills, which is $40. She doesn't have change, so I give her an additional $5, so total I give her $45. The book is $15, so change due is $45 - $15 = $30. So, the final change should be $30.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.

Perimeter of a square is 4 times side length. So, 4 * 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?

Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so that includes Katherine herself? The question is about how many children her mother has. So, if Katherine has two brothers and one sister, that means there are Katherine, two brothers, and one sister, so total 4 children. But let me confirm: "Katherine has two brothers and a sister" – this means she has two brothers and one sister, so including herself, that's four children. So, her mother has four children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1

According to order of operations, division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. Then, 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. So, 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?

This seems incomplete. It doesn't specify how many slices per person or anything. But typically, at a birthday party, each guest might need one slice, and Tom himself might also need a slice. So, if 5 guests have arrived, and Tom is the host, so total people: 5 guests + Tom = 6 people. So, they need 6 slices of cake. But the question doesn't say that Tom needs cake, but usually, the host also eats cake. I think it's safe to assume that each person needs one slice. So, 6 slices.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?

20% off means the sale price is 80% of original price. So, 25 * 0.8 = 20. So, $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?

From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM. First, from 3:45 to 6:45 would be 3 hours, but we need to 6:30, so from 3:45 to 6:30. Let me calculate the time difference. From 3:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes. From 4:00 to 6:00 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. From 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes. So total: 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes. So, 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?

22 people divided by 4 passengers per taxi. 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5, but since we can't have half a taxi, we need 6 taxis. Because 5 taxis can carry 20 people, and the remaining 2 people need another taxi. So, 6 taxis.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?

The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. So, 87 degrees.
