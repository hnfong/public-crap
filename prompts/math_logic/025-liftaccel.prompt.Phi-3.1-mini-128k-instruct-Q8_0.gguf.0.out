 1. To find the time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor, we need to consider the acceleration, maximum speed, and deceleration of the lift.

First, let's find the time it takes for the lift to reach its maximum speed:

v = u + at
5 = 0 + (1)(t)
t = 5 seconds

Now, let's find the distance covered during this acceleration phase:

s = ut + (1/2)at^2
s = 0 + (1/2)(1)(5^2)
s = 12.5 meters

Since the lift's maximum speed is 5 m/s, it will cover the remaining distance at this speed. The total distance to the top floor is:

40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters

The remaining distance is:

200 - 12.5 = 187.5 meters

Now, let's find the time it takes to cover this distance at the maximum speed:

t = s/v
t = 187.5/5
t = 37.5 seconds

Finally, let's find the time it takes for the lift to decelerate to a stop:

t = v/a
t = 5/1
t = 5 seconds

The total time it takes for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor is:

5 (acceleration) + 37.5 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 47.5 seconds

2. For the first person going to the 10th floor:

The distance to the 10th floor is:

10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters

Since the distance is greater than the distance covered during acceleration (12.5 meters), the lift will reach its maximum speed and then decelerate. The time taken for this journey is:

5 (acceleration) + 37.5 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 47.5 seconds

For the second person going to the 30th floor:

The distance to the 30th floor is:

30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters

The lift will accelerate for 12.5 meters, then travel at its maximum speed for the remaining distance (150 - 12.5 = 137.5 meters), and finally decelerate. The time taken for this journey is:

5 (acceleration) + 27.5 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 37.5 seconds

The total time for both people to reach their respective floors is:

47.5 (first person) + 37.5 (second person) = 85 seconds

3. For the first person going to the 40th floor, the lift will accelerate for 12.5 meters, then travel at its maximum speed for the remaining distance (200 - 12.5 = 187.5 meters), and finally decelerate. The time taken for this journey is:

5 (acceleration) + 37.5 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 47.5 seconds

Now, let's consider the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor if it has to stop at another floor between the ground floor and the 40th floor. Since the lift has to stop at another floor, we can assume it stops at the 20th floor (halfway point).

The distance to the 20th floor is:

20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters

The lift will accelerate for 12.5 meters, then travel at its maximum speed for the remaining distance (100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters), and finally decelerate. The time taken for this journey is:

5 (acceleration) + 17.5 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 27.5 seconds

Now, the lift will accelerate again for 12.5 meters, travel at its maximum speed for the remaining distance (187.5 - 12.5 = 175 meters), and finally decelerate. The time taken for this journey is:

5 (acceleration) + 35 (constant speed) + 5 (deceleration) = 45 seconds

The total minimum time it will take for the lift to get to the 40th floor with a stop at the 20th floor is:

27.5 (to 20th floor) + 45 (to 40th floor) = 72.5 seconds [end of text]
