<think>We are given: "There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall. The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s."

Questions:
1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?
2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?
3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

We need to compute time for elevator travel. The elevator accelerates at 1 m/s^2, decelerates at 1 m/s^2, maximum speed 5 m/s. Each floor is 5 meters. So total distance from ground to top: 40 floors? But careful: "ground floor (1/F)" to "top floor (40/F)". So floors: 1,2,...,40. So distance from floor 1 to floor 40: (40-1)*5 = 39*5 = 195 meters. But wait: "Each floor is 5 meters tall." So from ground floor to top floor: 40 floors? Actually: "40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." So total height: 40*5 = 200 meters. But then: "The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So distance: (40-1)*5 = 195 meters. But sometimes ground floor is considered floor 1, so top floor is floor 40, so difference: 39 floors, so 195 meters. But then: "Each floor is 5 meters tall." So if building has 40 stories, then height from ground to top is 40*5 = 200 meters. But then: "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)" so that is 39 intervals? Actually, in many buildings, ground floor is floor 1, then floor 2, ... floor 40. So the distance from floor 1 to floor 40 is (40-1)*5 = 195 meters. But then: "40 story building" might mean 40 floors above ground? But then "each floor is 5 meters tall" so total height = 40*5 = 200 meters. But then "from ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)" so that is 39 intervals? Actually, if building has 40 stories, then floors are 1,2,...,40. So the distance from floor 1 to floor 40 is (40-1)*5 = 195 meters. But then sometimes ground floor is not counted? But here it says "40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." So total height = 40*5 = 200 meters. And then "The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)." So that is from floor 1 to floor 40, so distance = (40-1)*5 = 195 meters. I'll check: If each floor is 5 meters, then from floor 1 to floor 2 is 5 meters, so from floor 1 to floor 40 is 39*5 = 195 meters. So I'll use 195 meters.

But wait: There is a 40 story building. That means 40 floors above ground? Actually, ground floor is usually story 1. So then top floor is story 40. So difference: 39 floors. So distance = 39*5 = 195 meters. So I'll use 195 meters.

Now, elevator: acceleration = 1 m/s^2, deceleration = 1 m/s^2, maximum speed = 5 m/s.

We need to compute time for travel from ground to top. The elevator will accelerate from 0 to 5 m/s, then travel at constant speed, then decelerate from 5 to 0. But if the distance is short, it might not reach maximum speed. So we check: The distance needed to accelerate to max speed: v^2/(2a) = 25/(2*1) = 12.5 meters. Similarly, deceleration distance: 12.5 meters. So total distance if both phases are used: 25 meters. So if total distance > 25 meters, then it will reach max speed. Here total distance = 195 meters, so definitely reaches max speed. So time: time to accelerate: t_acc = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds. Distance during acceleration: 0.5*a*t^2 = 0.5*1*25 = 12.5 meters. Similarly, deceleration: 5 seconds, distance 12.5 meters. So constant speed distance: 195 - 25 = 170 meters. Time at constant speed: 170/5 = 34 seconds. So total time = 5+34+5 = 44 seconds. So answer to question 1: 44 seconds.

But wait: The problem says "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)". So that is 195 meters. So answer: 44 seconds.

Now question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take? 
Interpretation: The lift starts from ground floor (1/F). It stops at floor 10 to drop off first person, then continues to floor 30 to drop off second person. But careful: The lift might decelerate and stop at floor 10, then accelerate again to go to floor 30. But then it stops at floor 30. So we need to compute total time from ground to floor 30, including stops? But the question: "How long does it take?" Possibly means the time from ground until the second person reaches their floor? But then the lift stops at floor 10, so time includes stop at floor 10? But then the lift might have to decelerate and stop, then accelerate again. So we compute: From ground (floor 1) to floor 10: distance = (10-1)*5 = 9*5 = 45 meters. Then from floor 10 to floor 30: distance = (30-10)*5 = 20*5 = 100 meters. But careful: The lift stops at floor 10. So the motion from ground to floor 10: It accelerates from 0 to max speed 5 m/s, but check if it reaches max speed? Distance needed to accelerate: 12.5 meters. So for 45 meters, it will reach max speed. So time for ground to floor 10: t_acc = 5 s, distance 12.5 m; constant speed: 45 - 25 = 20 m? Actually, total distance 45, so constant speed distance = 45 - 2*12.5 = 45 - 25 = 20 m. Time constant: 20/5 = 4 s. Then deceleration: 5 s. So total time from ground to floor 10: 5+4+5 = 14 s. But then there is a stop at floor 10. The person gets off? But then the lift accelerates again from floor 10 to floor 30. But careful: When the lift stops at floor 10, it decelerates to 0. Then it accelerates from 0 to max speed again for the next trip. So time from floor 10 to floor 30: distance = 100 m. Check if it reaches max speed: 12.5*2=25 m, so yes. So time: t_acc = 5 s, distance 12.5 m; constant speed: 100 - 25 = 75 m, time = 75/5 = 15 s; deceleration: 5 s. So total from floor 10 to floor 30: 5+15+5 = 25 s. But then there is a stop at floor 10? The lift stops at floor 10, so time includes the stop? But the question: "How long does it take?" Possibly means the time from ground until the second person reaches their floor? That would be 14 + 25 = 39 seconds. But wait: The lift stops at floor 10. Does it take time to open doors? The problem doesn't mention door opening time. So we assume instantaneous stop and start? So total time = 39 seconds.

But maybe there is a nuance: The lift might not stop at floor 10 if the first person gets off? But then it says "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F." So the lift stops at floor 10 to let first person off. So yes, it stops.

So answer for question 2: 39 seconds.

Now question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F? 
Interpretation: There are two people. First person goes to floor 40. Second person goes to some floor other than 40. The lift must stop at that floor to drop off the second person. We want the minimum time to get to floor 40, given that it stops at another floor. So we can choose the floor for the second person optimally to minimize total time? But the second person's destination is fixed? Actually, it says: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?" So the second person goes to some floor that is not 40. We want to minimize the total time to reach floor 40, given that the lift stops at that floor. So we can choose the second person's destination optimally? But then it says "minimum time" so we can choose the floor that minimizes total time? But then the second person's destination is given? Actually, it says: "Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?" So the second person goes to some floor other than 40. We want the minimum possible time to reach floor 40, given that the lift must stop at that floor. So we can choose the second person's floor optimally to minimize total time? But then the second person's destination is fixed? Actually, it says "assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor" so that means the second person goes to some floor that is not 40. But we are asked: "what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F?" So we can choose the second person's floor to minimize total time? But then if the second person goes to floor 1, then the lift stops at floor 1, but then it goes to floor 40. That time would be: from ground to floor 1: distance = 0? Actually, ground is floor 1? Wait: "ground floor (1/F)" so floor 1 is ground. So if second person goes to floor 1, then they are already at ground, so no stop? But then "if it has to stop at another floor" so that means the lift must stop at a floor that is not the ground and not the top? So second person goes to some floor between 2 and 39? So we want to minimize total time from ground to floor 40, including a stop at some floor k (2 ≤ k ≤ 39). The lift starts at floor 1, accelerates, decelerates at floor k, then accelerates again, decelerates at floor 40. But careful: The lift might not reach maximum speed in each segment if the distances are short. So we need to compute total time as function of k, and then find k that minimizes total time.

Let k be the floor where the second person gets off. Then distances: from floor 1 to floor k: d1 = (k-1)*5 meters. from floor k to floor 40: d2 = (40-k)*5 meters.

The lift motion: It starts from 0 at floor 1, accelerates at 1 m/s^2 until it reaches max speed 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s^2 to stop at floor k. Then it accelerates from 0 at floor k to max speed 5 m/s, then constant speed, then decelerates to stop at floor 40.

But if d1 is less than 25 meters, then it might not reach max speed. Similarly for d2. So we need to consider cases.

We want total time T(k) = time from ground to k + time from k to 40. And we want to minimize T(k) over k=2,...,39.

But note: The lift stops at k, so time includes the stop? But the problem doesn't mention time for opening doors. So we assume instantaneous stop and start? But then the deceleration and acceleration are separate. So total time is sum of times for each segment.

Let T1(d) be time to travel distance d from rest to rest with acceleration a=1, max speed v_max=5. The time is: if d <= v_max^2/a = 25, then it is triangular profile: time = 2*sqrt(d/a) = 2*sqrt(d). Because d = 0.5*a*t^2, so t = sqrt(2d/a) = sqrt(2d). But then total time = 2t = 2*sqrt(2d)? Wait: For triangular profile: accelerate from 0 to v, then decelerate to 0. The distance: d = v^2/(2a) + v^2/(2a) = v^2/a. So v = sqrt(a*d). Then time = v/a + v/a = 2v/a = 2 sqrt(d/a). So if d <= 25, then T1(d) = 2 sqrt(d). But check: d=12.5, then T1=2 sqrt(12.5)=2*3.535=7.07 s, but we computed earlier: acceleration time 5 s, deceleration 5 s, total 10 s? That is for d=25? Actually, for d=25, v_max=5, so time = 5+5=10 s. And 2 sqrt(25)=2*5=10 s. So formula: T1(d) = 2 sqrt(d) if d <= 25? But then for d=12.5, 2 sqrt(12.5)=2*3.535=7.07 s, but if it is triangular, then time = 2*sqrt(12.5/1)=2*3.535=7.07 s. But earlier we computed for ground to floor 10: d=45, so it is not triangular. So formula: T1(d) = if d <= v_max^2/a = 25, then T1(d) = 2 sqrt(d/a) = 2 sqrt(d). But if d > 25, then T1(d) = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = v_max/a + (d - v_max^2/a)/v_max + v_max/a = 2 v_max/a + (d - v_max^2/a)/v_max = 2*5/1 + (d - 25)/5 = 10 + (d-25)/5 = (d-25)/5 + 10 = (d/5 - 5) + 10 = d/5 + 5. So T1(d) = d/5 + 5 for d > 25. Check: d=45, T1=45/5+5=9+5=14, matches. d=195, T1=195/5+5=39+5=44, matches.

So total time T(k) = T1(d1) + T1(d2) where d1 = 5(k-1), d2 = 5(40-k) = 5(40-k). But careful: When the lift stops at k, it decelerates to 0 and then accelerates from 0. So the time for the second segment is T1(d2) as defined from rest to rest. So total time = T1(5(k-1)) + T1(5(40-k)).

We want to minimize T(k) over k=2,...,39.

Let d1 = 5(k-1), d2 = 5(40-k). Then T(k) = T1(d1) + T1(d2). And T1(d) = if d <= 25 then 2 sqrt(d) else d/5 + 5.

So we need to consider k such that d1 and d2 are either <=25 or >25.

d1 = 5(k-1). d1
