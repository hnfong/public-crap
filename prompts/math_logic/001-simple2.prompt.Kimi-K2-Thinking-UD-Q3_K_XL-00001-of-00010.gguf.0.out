The user asks three questions and wants answers with steps. I need to provide clear, step-by-step solutions for each.

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.
- I should list mathematical properties, cultural significance, and other interesting facts about 120.
- I need to be accurate and provide steps/reasoning where applicable.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
- This is a quadratic equation. I can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.
- Factoring seems straightforward here. I need to find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.
- Those numbers are -9 and +2.
- So: x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
- Solutions: x = 9 or x = -2
- I should show the steps clearly.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?
- A round trip means going from City A to City B and back to City A.
- Distance one way = 200 km
- Distance for a round trip = 200 km × 2 = 400 km
- Speed = 60 km/h
- Time for one round trip = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours = 6.666... hours
- A full day = 24 hours
- Number of round trips = Total time available / Time per round trip = 24 / (20/3) = 24 × 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6
- Since the train can't make a partial trip (assuming it needs to complete full round trips), it can make 3 full round trips.
- The question says "how many round trips can it make" - this could be interpreted as complete trips. 3.6 means it can complete 3 full trips and be partway through the 4th.
- I should clarify this in my answer.

Let me structure my response clearly for each question.

For Q1, I'll organize the properties into categories:
- Mathematical properties (factorial, triangular number, etc.)
- Divisibility properties
- Real-world significance
- Other interesting facts

For Q2, I'll show:
- The equation
- Factoring process
- Solutions
- Verification

For Q3, I'll show:
- Distance calculation for round trip
- Time per round trip calculation
- Total trips calculation
- Interpretation of the result

I should be confident in these answers as they are standard problems. No need for "I'm not sure" disclaimers here.Here are the answers to all three questions with detailed steps:

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Answer:**

120 is a highly composite number with many interesting mathematical and real-world properties:

**Mathematical Properties:**
1. **Factorial**: 120 = 5! (5 factorial) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. It's the smallest number that is the factorial of a number other than 1 or 2.

2. **Highly Composite Number**: It has 16 positive divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. This means it's divisible by many numbers, making it useful for divisions and fractions.

3. **Triangular Number**: 120 is the 15th triangular number, meaning it can be arranged in an equilateral triangle: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = 120.

4. **Hexagonal Number**: It's also the 8th hexagonal number, calculated by the formula n(2n−1) where n=8: 8(15) = 120.

5. **Sum of Twin Primes**: It can be expressed as the sum of four consecutive primes: 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 = 120.

6. **Perfect Number?**: No, but it's one less than 121 (11²) and has many divisors.

7. **Geometry**: In a circle, 120 degrees is the interior angle of a regular hexagon and the angle between vertices in a regular triangle tiling.

**Real-world Significance:**
- **Time**: 120 seconds = 2 minutes; 120 minutes = 2 hours
- **Age**: In some cultures, 120 years is considered the maximum human lifespan (e.g., "May you live to 120" in Jewish tradition)
- **Mathematical Convenience**: Used as a base in ancient number systems due to its many divisors

### **Q2: Solve the equation: x² - 7x - 18 = 0**

**Step-by-step solution:**

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:

1. **Set up the equation**: x² - 7x - 18 = 0

2. **Find two numbers** that multiply to -18 (the constant term) and add to -7 (the coefficient of x):
   - The numbers are -9 and +2 because: (-9) × (+2) = -18 and (-9) + (+2) = -7

3. **Factor the quadratic**: 
   x² - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

4. **Apply the Zero Product Property**: If (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0, then either:
   - x - 9 = 0, which gives **x = 9**
   - x + 2 = 0, which gives **x = -2**

5. **Verification**:
   - For x = 9: (9)² - 7(9) - 18 = 81 - 63 - 18 = 0 ✓
   - For x = -2: (-2)² - 7(-2) - 18 = 4 + 14 - 18 = 0 ✓

**Solutions**: x = 9 or x = -2

### **Q3: Train round trips problem**

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate round trip distance**:
   - One-way distance = 200 km
   - Round trip distance = 200 km × 2 = **400 km**

2. **Calculate time per round trip**:
   - Time = Distance ÷ Speed
   - Time = 400 km ÷ 60 km/h = **20/3 hours** (or 6 hours and 40 minutes)

3. **Calculate number of trips in 24 hours**:
   - Number of trips = Total time ÷ Time per trip
   - Number of trips = 24 hours ÷ (20/3 hours) = 24 × 3/20 = 72/20 = **3.6 trips**

4. **Interpretation**: Since the train cannot complete a partial round trip (it must return to the starting city), it can make **3 full round trips** in a day. After 3 trips (18 hours), there would be 6 hours remaining, which is insufficient for a 4th full round trip (which would require 6 hours and 40 minutes).

**Answer**: The train can make **3 complete round trips** in a full day. [end of text]
