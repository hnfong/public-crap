"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
The statement "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device to help remember the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. Let's break it down and provide examples to clarify.

### Explanation:

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion**:
   - The formula to convert Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) is:
     \[
     \text{°F} = \frac{9}{5} \times \text{°C} + 32
     \]

2. **Mnemonic Device**:
   - The mnemonic device suggests that every time the Celsius temperature increases by 12°C, the digits of the Fahrenheit temperature are inverted.

### Examples:

1. **Starting Point**:
   - Let's start with 0°C.
   - Converting 0°C to Fahrenheit:
     \[
     \text{°F} = \frac{9}{5} \times 0 + 32 = 32 \text{°F}
     \]

2. **Increase by 12°C**:
   - Now, increase the temperature by 12°C:
     \[
     0 + 12 = 12 \text{°C}
     \]
   - Converting 12°C to Fahrenheit:
     \[
     \text{°F} = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 53.6 \text{°F}
     \]
   - Notice that the digits in 53.6 (53) are the reverse of 32 (23).

3. **Increase by Another 12°C**:
   - Now, increase the temperature by another 12°C:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24 \text{°C}
     \]
   - Converting 24°C to Fahrenheit:
     \[
     \text{°F} = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 75.2 \text{°F}
     \]
   - Notice that the digits in 75.2 (75) are the reverse of 53 (35).

4. **Increase by Another 12°C**:
   - Now, increase the temperature by another 12°C:
     \[
     24 + 12 = 36 \text{°C}
     \]
   - Converting 36°C to Fahrenheit:
     \[
     \text{°F} = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 96.8 \text{°F}
     \]
   - Notice that the digits in 96.8 (96) are the reverse of 63 (36).

### Summary:
The mnemonic device "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" helps remember the pattern in the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Specifically, it highlights that as you increase the Celsius temperature by 12°C increments, the digits of the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature are the reverse of the previous Fahrenheit temperature. This pattern can help in quickly estimating the Fahrenheit temperature from a given Celsius temperature. [end of text]
