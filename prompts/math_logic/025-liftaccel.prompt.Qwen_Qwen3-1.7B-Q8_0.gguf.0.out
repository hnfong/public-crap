Let's solve each question step by step.

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

**Given:**
- Building has 40 floors.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall.
- Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s².
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s.

**Step 1: Calculate the total height of the building.**
$$
\text{Total height} = 40 \text{ floors} \times 5 \text{ m/floor} = 200 \text{ m}
$$

**Step 2: Determine the time to accelerate to maximum speed.**
- The lift accelerates from rest to 5 m/s.
- Acceleration = 1 m/s².
- Time to reach max speed:
$$
t = \frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{5 - 0}{1} = 5 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 3: Determine the time to decelerate from max speed to rest.**
- The lift decelerates from 5 m/s to rest.
- Time to decelerate:
$$
t = \frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{5 - 0}{1} = 5 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 4: Determine the time to travel the height at constant speed.**
- The lift travels at 5 m/s for the remaining distance.
- Distance remaining = 200 m - (distance traveled during acceleration and deceleration).
- Distance during acceleration and deceleration:
$$
\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 12.5 \text{ m}
$$
- Remaining distance:
$$
200 - 12.5 = 187.5 \text{ m}
$$
- Time to travel remaining distance at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{187.5}{5} = 37.5 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 5: Total time to reach top floor:**
$$
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ s} + 5 \text{ s} + 37.5 \text{ s} = 47.5 \text{ s}
$$

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

**Given:**
- Lift has 40 floors.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall.
- Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s².
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s.

**Step 1: Calculate the height for each person.**
- Person 1: 10 floors = 10 × 5 = 50 m
- Person 2: 30 floors = 30 × 5 = 150 m

**Step 2: Time for Person 1 (to 10/F):**
- Distance = 50 m
- Time to accelerate and decelerate:
$$
\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times t^2 = 0.5 t^2
$$
$$
0.5 t^2 = 50 \Rightarrow t^2 = 100 \Rightarrow t = 10 \text{ s}
$$
- Time to travel at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ s}
$$
- Total time for Person 1:
$$
10 + 10 = 20 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 3: Time for Person 2 (to 30/F):**
- Distance = 150 m
- Time to accelerate and decelerate:
$$
0.5 t^2 = 150 \Rightarrow t^2 = 300 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{300} \approx 17.32 \text{ s}
$$
- Time to travel at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{150}{5} = 30 \text{ s}
$$
- Total time for Person 2:
$$
17.32 + 30 = 47.32 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 4: Total time for both people:**
$$
20 + 47.32 = 67.32 \text{ s}
$$

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

**Given:**
- Lift has 40 floors.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall.
- Acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s².
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s.
- Second person does not go to 40/F.

**Step 1: Total height of the building:**
$$
40 \times 5 = 200 \text{ m}
$$

**Step 2: Time for the lift to go from 1/F to 40/F with no stops:**
- Time to accelerate and decelerate:
$$
\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0.5 \times 1 \times t^2 = 0.5 t^2
$$
- Time to travel at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \text{ s}
$$
- Total time without stops:
$$
t = 5 + 5 + 40 = 50 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 3: To minimize time, the lift must stop at a floor between 1/F and 40/F. Let's assume it stops at floor 20/F.**

**Step 4: Time to go from 1/F to 20/F:**
- Distance = 20 × 5 = 100 m
- Time to accelerate and decelerate:
$$
0.5 t^2 = 100 \Rightarrow t^2 = 200 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{200} \approx 14.14 \text{ s}
$$
- Time to travel at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ s}
$$
- Total time for 1/F to 20/F:
$$
14.14 + 20 = 34.14 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 5: Time to go from 20/F to 40/F:**
- Distance = 20 × 5 = 100 m
- Time to accelerate and decelerate:
$$
0.5 t^2 = 100 \Rightarrow t = 14.14 \text{ s}
$$
- Time to travel at constant speed:
$$
t = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ s}
$$
- Total time for 20/F to 40/F:
$$
14.14 + 20 = 34.14 \text{ s}
$$

**Step 6: Total time for the lift to go from 1/F to 40/F with one stop at 20/F:**
$$
34.14 + 34.14 = 68.28 \text{ s}
$$
