Certainly! The statement you provided is a mnemonic device to help remember the conversion formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Here's a breakdown of what it means and how it works:

1. **Every 12°C**: This means that every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits in the Fahrenheit temperature will be inverted. For example, if you have a Celsius temperature of 12°C, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will be 212°F. Similarly, if you have a Celsius temperature of 24°C, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will be 432°F.

2. **The digits are inverted**: This means that the tens and ones digits of the Celsius temperature will be swapped in the Fahrenheit temperature. For example, if you have a Celsius temperature of 34°C, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will be 43°F. If you have a Celsius temperature of 45°C, the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature will be 54°F.

Here are some examples to illustrate the mnemonic:

- **Celsius 12°C**: Fahrenheit 212°F (12 and 2 are inverted)
- **Celsius 24°C**: Fahrenheit 432°F (24 and 3 are inverted)
- **Celsius 34°C**: Fahrenheit 43°F (34 and 3 are inverted)
- **Celsius 45°C**: Fahrenheit 54°F (45 and 5 are inverted)

This mnemonic can be helpful for quickly estimating the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature, but it's important to note that it's not a perfect conversion method and may not be accurate for all temperatures. For precise conversions, it's best to use the standard formula:

\[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

where \( F \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \( C \) is the temperature in Celsius.
