Let's solve each question step by step.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

To find the time it takes to go from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F), we need to calculate the total distance and the time it takes to cover that distance considering the acceleration and deceleration.

1. Calculate the total distance:
   - Each floor is 5 meters tall.
   - There are 40 floors.
   - Total distance = 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

2. Calculate the time to reach the top floor:
   - The lift starts from rest (initial velocity = 0 m/s).
   - The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s.
   - Time to reach maximum speed: t1 = (v - u) / a = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds.
   - The lift then moves at a constant speed of 5 m/s until it reaches the top floor.
   - Distance covered at constant speed: d2 = v * t2 = 5 m/s * t2.
   - Total distance = d1 + d2, where d1 is the distance covered during acceleration.
   - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * (5 s)² = 12.5 meters.
   - So, d2 = 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters.
   - Time to cover d2 at constant speed: t2 = d2 / v = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds.
   - Total time = t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds = 42.5 seconds.

So, it takes 42.5 seconds for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor.

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

To find the time it takes for both people to reach their respective floors, we need to calculate the time for each person separately.

1. Calculate the time for the first person to reach 10/F:
   - Distance to cover: 10 floors * 5 meters/floor = 50 meters.
   - Using the same method as in Question 1:
     - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 12.5 meters (same as before).
     - d2 = 50 meters - 12.5 meters = 37.5 meters.
     - t2 = d2 / v = 37.5 meters / 5 m/s = 7.5 seconds.
   - Total time for the first person: t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 7.5 seconds = 12.5 seconds.

2. Calculate the time for the second person to reach 30/F:
   - Distance to cover: 30 floors * 5 meters/floor = 150 meters.
   - Using the same method as in Question 1:
     - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 12.5 meters (same as before).
     - d2 = 150 meters - 12.5 meters = 137.5 meters.
     - t2 = d2 / v = 137.5 meters / 5 m/s = 27.5 seconds.
   - Total time for the second person: t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 27.5 seconds = 32.5 seconds.

Since both people are in the same lift, the total time it takes for both people to reach their respective floors is the maximum of the two times, which is 32.5 seconds.

So, it takes 32.5 seconds for both people to reach their respective floors.

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To find the minimum time it takes for the lift to get to 40/F, we need to consider the time it takes to reach the top floor while stopping at another floor.

1. Calculate the time to reach the top floor while stopping at another floor:
   - The lift starts from rest (initial velocity = 0 m/s).
   - The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches its maximum speed of 5 m/s.
   - Time to reach maximum speed: t1 = (v - u) / a = (5 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 m/s² = 5 seconds.
   - The lift then moves at a constant speed of 5 m/s until it reaches the top floor.
   - Distance covered at constant speed: d2 = v * t2 = 5 m/s * t2.
   - Total distance = d1 + d2, where d1 is the distance covered during acceleration.
   - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 0.5 * 1 m/s² * (5 s)² = 12.5 meters.
   - So, d2 = 200 meters - 12.5 meters = 187.5 meters.
   - Time to cover d2 at constant speed: t2 = d2 / v = 187.5 meters / 5 m/s = 37.5 seconds.
   - Total time = t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 37.5 seconds = 42.5 seconds.

However, since the lift has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, we need to add the time it takes to stop at that floor.

2. Calculate the time to stop at another floor:
   - Let's assume the lift stops at floor 20/F (midpoint).
   - Distance to cover from 1/F to 20/F: 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.
   - Using the same method as in Question 1:
     - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 12.5 meters (same as before).
     - d2 = 100 meters - 12.5 meters = 87.5 meters.
     - t2 = d2 / v = 87.5 meters / 5 m/s = 17.5 seconds.
   - Total time to reach floor 20/F: t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 17.5 seconds = 22.5 seconds.
   - Time to stop at floor 20/F: Assuming the lift stops for a negligible amount of time (e.g., 1 second), the total time remains approximately 22.5 seconds.

3. Calculate the time to reach 40/F from floor 20/F:
   - Distance to cover from 20/F to 40/F: 20 floors * 5 meters/floor = 100 meters.
   - Using the same method as in Question 1:
     - d1 = 0.5 * a * t1² = 12.5 meters (same as before).
     - d2 = 100 meters - 12.5 meters = 87.5 meters.
     - t2 = d2 / v = 87.5 meters / 5 m/s = 17.5 seconds.
   - Total time to reach 40/F: t1 + t2 = 5 seconds + 17.5 seconds = 22.5 seconds.

4. Total time to reach 40/F:
   - Total time = time to reach floor 20/F + time to stop + time to reach 40/F = 22.5 seconds + 1 second + 22.5 seconds = 46 seconds.

So, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F, considering it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, is approximately 46 seconds. [end of text]
