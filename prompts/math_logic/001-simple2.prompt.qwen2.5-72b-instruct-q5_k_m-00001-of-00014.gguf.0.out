Sure, let's go through each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

1. **Mathematical Properties:**
   - **Factorial:** \(120 = 5!\) (5 factorial), which means \(120 = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\).
   - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
   - **Sum of Consecutive Integers:** 120 can be expressed as the sum of the first 15 positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 15 = 120\).
   - **Triangular Number:** 120 is the 15th triangular number, which means it can be represented as a triangle with 15 rows of dots.

2. **Historical and Cultural Significance:**
   - **Time:** There are 120 minutes in 2 hours.
   - **Biblical:** In the Bible, the number 120 is mentioned several times, such as the age of Moses when he died.
   - **Measurement:** In some ancient systems, 120 was used as a unit of measurement, such as the "great hundred" in some cultures.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\).

1. **Identify coefficients:**
   - \(a = 1\)
   - \(b = -7\)
   - \(c = -18\)

2. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   \[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

3. **Apply the quadratic formula:**
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \( x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - \( x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   - Distance for one round trip: \(200 \text{ km} \times 2 = 400 \text{ km}\)
   - Speed: \(60 \text{ km/h}\)
   - Time for one round trip: \(\frac{400 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{400}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in a full day:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - Number of round trips: \(\frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours/round trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\)

Since the train cannot make a partial round trip, we take the integer part of 3.6, which is 3.

So, the train can make \(\boxed{3}\) round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
