Okay, let's break down these lift problems step-by-step. This involves understanding constant acceleration, constant velocity, and some time calculations.

**Understanding the Basics**

*   **Total Distance:** The building is 40 stories * 5 meters/story = 200 meters tall.
*   **Acceleration/Deceleration:** 1 m/s² means the lift's speed changes by 1 meter per second every second.
*   **Maximum Speed:** 5 m/s is the fastest the lift will go.

**Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?**

This problem involves three phases: acceleration, constant velocity, and deceleration.

*   **Phase 1: Acceleration**
    *   Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s
    *   Final velocity (v) = 5 m/s
    *   Acceleration (a) = 1 m/s²
    *   Using the equation v = u + at, we find the time to reach maximum speed: 5 = 0 + 1 * t  => t = 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during acceleration (s) = ut + 0.5at² = 0 * 5 + 0.5 * 1 * 5² = 12.5 meters

*   **Phase 2: Constant Velocity**
    *   Total distance = 200 meters
    *   Distance covered during acceleration and deceleration = 12.5 meters + 12.5 meters = 25 meters (assuming the same deceleration as acceleration)
    *   Distance covered at constant velocity = 200 - 25 = 175 meters
    *   Speed = 5 m/s
    *   Time taken at constant velocity = distance / speed = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds

*   **Phase 3: Deceleration**
    *   Initial velocity (u) = 5 m/s
    *   Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s
    *   Acceleration (a) = -1 m/s² (deceleration)
    *   Using the equation v = u + at, we find the time to decelerate: 0 = 5 + (-1) * t => t = 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during deceleration = ut + 0.5at² = 5 * 5 + 0.5 * (-1) * 5² = 12.5 meters

*   **Total Time:** 5 seconds (acceleration) + 35 seconds (constant velocity) + 5 seconds (deceleration) = **45 seconds**

**Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

This is a bit more complex because the lift doesn't go straight to the top. We need to consider the time to 10/F, the time to 30/F *from* 10/F, and the fact that the lift might not need to fully decelerate at 10/F.

*   **Distance to 10/F:** 10 stories * 5 meters/story = 50 meters
*   **Phase 1: Acceleration to 10/F**
    *   We need to determine if the lift reaches its maximum speed before reaching 10/F.
    *   Using the equation v² = u² + 2as:  v² = 0² + 2 * 1 * 50 = 100 => v = 10 m/s.
    *   Since the maximum speed is 5 m/s, the lift will reach its maximum speed *before* 10/F.
    *   Time to reach 5 m/s: 5 seconds (from Question 1)
    *   Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters (from Question 1)
    *   Remaining distance to 10/F: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 meters
    *   Time to cover remaining distance at 5 m/s: 37.5 / 5 = 7.5 seconds
    *   Total time to 10/F: 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 seconds

*   **Phase 2: Deceleration at 10/F**
    *   Time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s: 5 seconds (from Question 1)
    *   Distance covered during deceleration: 12.5 meters
    *   Since the lift is stopping at 10/F, it needs to decelerate.

*   **Phase 3: Acceleration from 10/F to 30/F**
    *   Distance from 10/F to 30/F: (30 - 10) stories * 5 meters/story = 100 meters
    *   The lift will accelerate from 0 m/s to 5 m/s.
    *   Time to reach 5 m/s: 5 seconds (from Question 1)
    *   Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
    *   Remaining distance to 30/F: 100 - 12.5 = 87.5 meters
    *   Time to cover remaining distance at 5 m/s: 87.5 / 5 = 17.5 seconds
    *   Total time to 30/F: 5 + 17.5 = 22.5 seconds

*   **Phase 4: Deceleration at 30/F**
    *   Time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s: 5 seconds (from Question 1)
    *   Distance covered during deceleration: 12.5 meters

*   **Total Time:** 12.5 + 5 + 22.5 + 5 = **45 seconds**

**Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the floor closest to the ground floor. Let's assume the second person gets off at 1/F. This is the closest floor to the ground floor.

*   **Phase 1: Acceleration to 40/F**
    *   Distance to 40/F: 40 stories * 5 meters/story = 200 meters
    *   As calculated in Question 1, the lift reaches its maximum speed before reaching 40/F.
    *   Time to reach 5 m/s: 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during acceleration: 12.5 meters
    *   Remaining distance to 40/F: 200 - 12.5 = 187.5 meters
    *   Time to cover remaining distance at 5 m/s: 187.5 / 5 = 37.5 seconds
    *   Total time to 40/F: 5 + 37.5 = 42.5 seconds

*   **Phase 2: Deceleration at 40/F**
    *   Time to decelerate from 5 m/s to 0 m/s: 5 seconds
    *   Distance covered during deceleration: 12.5 meters

*   **Total Time:** 42.5 + 5 = **47.5 seconds**

**Important Considerations and Assumptions:**

*   **Instantaneous Stops:** We're assuming the lift stops
