I need to answer these three questions about a lift in a 40-story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall, so the total height is 40 floors times 5 meters, which is 200 meters. The lift accelerates and decelerates at 1 m/s² and has a maximum speed of 5 m/s.

First question: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

I need to find the time for the lift to go from floor 1 to floor 40. Since it's accelerating and decelerating, I should consider the motion with constant acceleration until it reaches max speed, then constant speed, then deceleration to stop.

But the question doesn't specify that it needs to stop at the top floor. It just says "get from the ground floor to the top floor." I think we assume it starts from rest and stops at the top floor, right? Otherwise, if it doesn't stop, it might not decelerate, but the problem says it has acceleration and deceleration, so probably it does stop.

Let me read the question again: "How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?"

It doesn't explicitly say it stops, but in the context, since it has acceleration and deceleration, and it's going to the top floor, I think it's implied that it starts from rest and stops at the top floor. Otherwise, if it doesn't stop, the time might be different.

Similarly for the other questions, it mentions stopping at floors, so for this one, I'll assume it starts from rest and stops at the top floor.

So, for question 1: lift starts from ground floor (floor 1, height 0) with initial velocity 0, accelerates at 1 m/s² to max speed 5 m/s, then travels at constant speed, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop at top floor (height 200m).

First, I need to find the distance it travels while accelerating and decelerating.

Let a = 1 m/s² (acceleration and deceleration)

v_max = 5 m/s

The time to reach max speed from rest: t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds.

Distance during acceleration: s_acc = (1/2) * a * t_acc² = (1/2) * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters.

Similarly, deceleration from v_max to 0, same distance, s_dec = 12.5 meters.

Now, the total distance to cover is 200 meters.

So, the distance at constant speed is s_const = total distance - s_acc - s_dec = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 200 - 25 = 175 meters.

Time at constant speed: t_const = s_const / v_max = 175 / 5 = 35 seconds.

Total time: t_total = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 35 + 5 = 45 seconds.

But is this correct? Let me think.

The lift accelerates for 5 seconds to cover 12.5m, then decelerates for 5 seconds to cover another 12.5m from 200m down to 187.5m or something? Let's think carefully.

Start from height 0, accelerate to 5m/s in 5 seconds, covering 12.5m.

Then from 12.5m to 12.5 + 175 = 187.5m at constant speed, which is from floor 3 to floor 37? Let's find out which floors.

Each floor is 5m, so floor 1: 0m, floor 2: 5m, ..., floor 40: 195m? I think I messed up the height.

Ground floor is 1/F, which I assume is height 0. Top floor is 40/F, height 200m? 40 stories, each 5m, so from ground to top, it's 40 floors, but ground floor is included, so the height to travel is from 0 to 200m for 40/F.

Floor 1: 0m

Floor 2: 5m

...

Floor 40: 5*39 = 195m? Let's clarify.

Typically, in buildings, ground floor is floor 1, and height is from 0 to the top floor height.

But the problem says "each floor is 5 meters tall," so the distance between floors is 5m, but the lift starts from ground floor and goes to top floor, so the vertical distance is from 0 to 200m if there are 40 floors, each adding 5m height.

Let's read: "a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall." And "from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)."

I think "each floor is 5 meters tall" means the height of each floor is 5m, so from ground to floor 2 is 5m, floor 2 to floor 3 is another 5m, so to go from 1/F to 40/F, it needs to travel 39 intervals of 5m, so 195 meters.

Similarly, for floors, 1/F is 0m, 2/F is 5m, ..., 40/F is 195m.

But the lift is going from 1/F to 40/F, so distance is 195 meters.

In my earlier calculation, I used 200m, which is wrong.

Let me correct that.

Total height to travel: from floor 1 to floor 40, there are 39 floors above, each 5m, so 195 meters.

Acceleration: a = 1 m/s²

Max speed: v_max = 5 m/s

Time to reach max speed: t_acc = v_max / a = 5 / 1 = 5 seconds

Distance during acceleration: s_acc = (1/2) * a * t_acc² = (1/2) * 1 * 25 = 12.5 meters

Similarly for deceleration.

Now, the constant speed distance: s_const = total distance - s_acc - s_dec = 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 195 - 25 = 170 meters

Time at constant speed: t_const = s_const / v_max = 170 / 5 = 34 seconds

Total time: t_total = t_acc + t_const + t_dec = 5 + 34 + 5 = 44 seconds

But is the lift stopping at the top floor? Yes, I assumed it decelerates to stop.

Now, for question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F.

Now, the lift has to stop at 10/F and then at 30/F.

But it starts from ground floor, so it will accelerate to max speed, then travel to 10/F, but since it has to stop there, it might need to decelerate or something.

Let's think carefully.

The lift is moving from ground to top, but with multiple stops.

In this case, it starts from ground, goes to 10/F, then to 30/F.

But the acceleration and deceleration are given, but not specified for the entire journey or per segment.

I think we need to assume that the lift accelerates from rest to max speed, then travels at constant speed until it needs to slow down for a stop, then decelerates to stop, and if there are multiple stops, it might accelerate again or something.

But the problem says "its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2" and "maximum speed is 5m/s," but it doesn't specify the behavior at stops.

Typically, for such problems, we assume that the lift accelerates from rest to max speed, then decelerates to stop at each floor, but for intermediate floors, it might not need to decelerate if it's going to accelerate again, but since it has a maximum speed, and it stops, it probably decelerates to stop and then accelerates from stop.

But in this case, for question 2, it's going from 1/F to 10/F and then to 30/F.

First, from 1/F to 10/F.

10/F is the 10th floor, so height from 0 to 50m (since 10 floors * 5m each, but floor 1 is 0, floor 2 is 5, ..., floor 10 is 45m? Let's define the height properly.

Set floor 1 at height 0m.

Floor 2 at height 5m.

Floor 3 at height 10m.

...

Floor n at height 5*(n-1) meters.

So floor 10: height 5*9 = 45m

Floor 30: height 5*29 = 145m

Floor 40: height 5*39 = 195m

Now, for the lift to go from 1/F to 10/F.

It starts from 0m with v=0, accelerates to v_max=5m/s at a=1m/s².

Time to reach v_max: t_acc = 5/1 = 5 seconds

Distance during acc: s_acc = (1/2)*1*25 = 12.5m

Now, at 10/F, which is 45m height, it needs to stop, so it will decelerate from v_max to 0 at a=1m/s².

Time to decelerate: t_dec = v_max / a = 5/1 = 5 seconds

Distance during dec: s_dec = (1/2)*1*25 = 12.5m

But the distance to 10/F is 45m.

If it accelerates to v_max and then decelerates to stop at 45m, the distance covered during acc and dec must be less than or equal to 45m.

s_acc + s_dec = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25m, which is less than 45m, so it can reach v_max before 45m and then decelerate.

The point where it reaches v_max is at 12.5m, then it travels at constant speed until it needs to decelerate.

But for stopping at 10/F, which is 45m, since 45m > 12.5m, it will reach v_max at 12.5m, then from 12.5m to 45m, it travels at constant speed.

Distance from 12.5m to 45m is 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m

At constant speed, time to cover 32.5m: t_const = 32.5 / 5 = 6.5 seconds

Then decelerate from 45m to stop, but deceleration starts from v_max, so at 45m, it decelerates for 5 seconds to cover 12.5m back, but since it's stopping, the distance during dec is from the point where it starts decelerating to the stop point.

Let's think of the motion from start to stop at 10/F.

Start: position 0, v=0

Accelerate to v=5m/s, time 5s, distance 12.5m

Then from 12.5m to 45m at v=5m/s, distance 32.5m, time 6.5s

Then decelerate from v=5m/s to 0, time 5s, distance 12.5m, but this deceleration is from 45m towards lower floors? No, the lift is going upwards, so when it reaches 45m, it decelerates to stop at 45m.

In this case, for going to 10/F, the stop is at 45m, so after reaching v_max at 12.5m, it travels to 45m at constant speed, then decelerates to stop at 45m.

But when it decelerates from 45m, it covers 12.5m during deceleration, but since it's stopping at 45m, the deceleration should start from a point before 45m so that it comes to stop at 45m.

Standard way: the lift accelerates from rest to v_max, then if the distance to the stop is greater than the distance to v_max, it travels at constant speed, then decelerates to stop.

But the deceleration distance is fixed at 12.5m for v_max=5m/s and a=1m/s².

Similarly for acceleration.

So for a stop at height h, the time to reach h depends on whether h is less than, equal to, or greater than the distance to v_max.

Let d_acc = distance to reach v_max from rest = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 25 / 2 = 12.5m

Similarly, d_dec = distance to decelerate from v_max to 0 = 12.5m

Now, for a stop at height h:

If h <= d_acc, then it reaches v_max before reaching h, so it accelerates to v_max and then decelerates to stop at h, but since h <= d_acc, the deceleration might not be needed if it stops before reaching v_max, but with constant acceleration, it usually accelerates to v_max and then decelerates unless specified otherwise.

But in this case, for h=45m, which is greater than d_acc=12.5m, so it will reach v_max at 12.5m, then travel at constant speed to 45m, then decelerate to stop.

But when it decelerates from 45m, it needs to cover d_dec=12.5m to stop, but since it's stopping at 45m, the deceleration should start from a point such that after decelerating for t_dec=5s, it stops at 45m.

Let's define the position.

Let the lift start from position 0 with v=0.

It accelerates at 1m/s² until it reaches 5m/s or until it needs to stop.

But for simplicity, we can assume that the lift accelerates to v_max as soon as possible, then maintains v_max until it needs to slow down for a stop, then decelerates to stop.

Similarly for multiple stops.

For question 2, from 1/F to 10/F and then to 30/F.

First, from 1/F to 10/F: height 0 to 45m.

d_acc = 12.5m, v_max=5m/s

Since 45m > 12.5m, the lift will:

- Accelerate from 0 to 5m/s in 5 seconds, covering 12.5m

- Then travel at 5m/s for the remaining distance to 45m.

Remaining distance: 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m

Time at constant speed: 32.5 / 5 = 6.5 seconds

- Then decelerate from 5m/s to 0 in 5 seconds, covering 12.5m, but this deceleration is from 45m, so it stops at 45m after decelerating.

But the deceleration covers 12.5m from 45m, so it stops at 45m.

Now, time to reach 10/F: t_to_10F = time to acc + time const + time dec

But time dec is for decelerating from v_max to stop, which takes 5 seconds and covers 12.5m, but since we stop at 45m, and we have already covered 12.5m during acc, the const speed part is from 12.5m to 45m, 32.5m.

Then deceleration from 45m to 45m - 12.5m? No.

When decelerating from v_max to stop, the distance covered during deceleration is d_dec = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 12.5m, so from the point where it starts decelerating, it moves 12.5m to stop.

In this case, for stop at 45m, it starts decelerating at a point such that after 5 seconds, it stops at 45m.

But since it's moving at constant speed, it starts decelerating at 45m - d_dec = 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m from the start? Let's think.

From start to reaching v_max: 12.5m

Then from 12.5m to 45m at constant speed: 32.5m

Then from 45m, it decelerates, but deceleration starts immediately after reaching constant speed, I think.

Standard model: the lift accelerates from rest to v_max over a distance d_acc, then travels at v_max for some distance, then decelerates to stop over d_dec.

For a single stop at height h, if h > d_acc + d_dec, then it accelerates to v_max, travels at constant speed to h - d_dec, then decelerates to stop at h.

If h < d_acc, then it accelerates to v_max but stops before reaching v_max, so it decelerates earlier.

But in this problem, since acceleration and deceleration are constant, and v_max is given, we need to find the time based on the distance.

For simplicity, let's assume that the lift always accelerates to v_max if the distance is sufficient, and decelerates to stop at the destination.

But for intermediate stops, it might not reach v_max if the stop is close.

In question 2, from 1/F to 10/F, h=45m.

d_acc = 12.5m, d_dec = 12.5m

Since 45m > d_acc, it will reach v_max.

The distance to travel at constant speed is h - d_acc = 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m

Then time to decelerate is t_dec = v_max / a = 5/1 = 5 seconds, but this deceleration is from the point where it starts decelerating.

Typically, for a stop at h, the lift will accelerate to v_max if h > d_acc, then from the point where it reaches v_max, it travels to h - d_dec, then decelerates to stop.

Let's define:

- Acceleration phase: from 0 to v_max, distance d_acc = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 12.5m, time t_acc = v_max / a = 5s

- Deceleration phase: from v_max to 0, distance d_dec = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 12.5m, time t_dec = 5s

- Constant speed phase: if the stop is at h, and h > d_acc, then the lift reaches v_max at position d_acc, then it needs to cover the remaining distance to h, but since it decelerates at the end, the remaining distance should be such that after decelerating, it stops at h.

So, from position d_acc, it travels at constant speed to position h - d_dec, then decelerates to stop at h.

Position h - d_dec to h is d_dec, but at constant speed, it goes from d_acc to h - d_dec.

Let's set the position.

Start at 0.

After acceleration, at position d_acc = 12.5m, velocity v_max.

Then, to reach stop at h, it travels from 12.5m to (h - d_dec) at constant speed, distance s_const = (h - d_dec) - d_acc

Then from (h - d_dec) to h, it decelerates, distance d_dec.

But (h - d_dec) to h is d_dec, so the point where it starts decelerating is at h - d_dec.

Similarly, for h=45m, d_dec=12.5m, so start decelerating at 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m

But 32.5m is the position, which corresponds to floor ceil(32.5/5) or something, but we're dealing with height.

Height 32.5m: since floor 1 is 0, floor 2 is 5, ..., floor n is 5*(n-1)

So height 32.5m: 32.5 / 5 = 6.5, so between floor 7 and floor 8, but since floors are discrete, but for time calculation, we can use height.

For stop at h=45m, which is floor 10.

d_acc = 12.5m, so it reaches v_max at 12.5m, which is floor ceil(12.5/5) = floor 3, since 12.5/5=2.5, so between floor 2 and 3, but floor 2 is 5m, floor 3 is 10m, so at 12.5m, it's between floor 3 and 4? Let's calculate floor.

Floor 1: 0m

Floor 2: 5m

Floor 3: 10m

Floor 4: 15m

...

Floor n: 5*(n-1)m

So for height h, the floor is floor = ceil(h/5) or something.

But for time, we don't need floor, just height.

So for h=45m, floor 10.

d_acc = 12.5m, which is between floor 3 (10m) and floor 4 (15m), specifically at 12.5m.

Then from 12.5m to 45m - 12.5m = 32.5m at constant speed? No.

To stop at 45m, it starts decelerating at 45m - d_dec = 45 - 12.5 = 32.5m.

Then from 32.5m to 45m, it decelerates, covering 12.5m in 5 seconds.

But from start to 32.5m: first, accelerate from 0 to 12.5m, then from 12.5m to 32.5m at constant speed.

Position 0 to 12.5m: acceleration

12.5m to 32.5m: constant speed, distance 20m, time 20/5 = 4 seconds

Then from 32.5m to 45m: deceleration, distance 12.5m, time 5 seconds.

But the stop is at 45m, so time to reach 10/F is time from 0 to 45m.

From 0 to 12.5m: 5 seconds

From 12.5m to 32.5m: 4 seconds (constant speed)

From 32.5m to 45m: 5 seconds (deceleration)

But during deceleration, it is moving from 32.5m to 45m, but decelerating, so it reaches 45m with v=0.

Total time to 45m: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 seconds.

But let's verify the distance.

From 0 to 12.5m: 12.5m

From 12.5m to 32.5m: 20m at v=5m/s

From 32.5m to 45m: 12.5m decelerating from v=5 to 0.

Yes.

Since it starts from rest and stops at 45m, the average speed can be used.

But let's keep it general.

For a distance d, with acceleration a to v_max, then deceleration a to stop.

The time depends on whether d <= 2*d_acc or not.

d_acc = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 25/2 = 12.5m

If d <= d_acc, then it accelerates to v_max but stops before, so time is less.

But in this case, d=45m > 12.5m, so it reaches v_max.

The minimum distance for acceleration and deceleration is 2*d_acc = 25m.

If d <= 25m, then the lift can accelerate to v_max and decelerate to stop within the distance.

For d=45m > 25m, so it has constant speed phase.

General formula:

Let d = total distance to travel.

a = 1 m/s²

v_max = 5 m/s

d_acc = (v_max)^2 / (2a) = 25/2 = 12.5m

d_dec = same, 12.5m

If d <= 2*d_acc = 25m, then time t = 2 * (v_max / a) * (d / (2*d_acc)) or something.

For d <= 25m, the lift accelerates to v_max and decelerates, but the distance d must be at least d_acc to reach v_max.

If d < d_acc, then it never reaches v_max, so time to stop at d is t = sqrt(2d/a) since v=0 at start and end.

But in this problem, v_max is given, so probably we assume it reaches v_max if possible.

Similarly for deceleration.

But for d < d_acc, it would decelerate before reaching v_max, but with constant acceleration, it's simpler to use the equations.

Since the building has floors, and lift stops at floors, we need to consider the height to each floor.

But for now, let's stick with height.

For question 1, from 1/F to 40/F, height 0 to 195m.

d = 195m

2*d_acc = 25m

Since 195 > 25, there is constant speed phase.

d_acc = 12.5m

d_dec = 12.5m

The distance for constant speed is d - d_acc - d_dec = 195 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 170m

Time for acceleration: t_acc = v_max / a = 5/1 = 5s

Time for deceleration: t_dec = 5s

Time for constant speed: t_const = 170 / 5 = 34s

Total time: 5 + 34 + 5 = 44s

Now for question 2: from 1/F to 10/F, height 0 to 45m.

d = 45m

2*d_acc = 25m, 45 > 25, so constant speed phase.

d_acc = 12.5m

d_dec = 12.5m

Constant speed distance: s_const = d - d_acc - d_dec = 45 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 20m

Time to acc: 5s

Time to dec: 5s

Time const: 20 / 5 = 4s

Total time to 10/F: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14s

But this is the time to reach 10/F and stop.

Now, after stopping at 10/F, the lift needs to go to 30/F.

30/F is height 5*29 = 145m

Now, from 10/F (45m) to 30/F (145m), but the lift is at 45m with v=0, since it stopped.

Then it accelerates from rest to v_max, then if necessary, constant speed, then decelerates to stop at 145m.

But the acceleration and deceleration are from the current position.

Also, the maximum speed is 5m/s, but when it starts from 10/F, it accelerates from 0.

Now, the distance from 45m to 145m is 100m.

d = 100m

d_acc = 12.5m, d_dec = 12.5m

2*d_acc = 25m, 100 > 25, so constant speed phase.

s_const = d - d_acc - d_dec = 100 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 75m

t_acc = 5s

t_dec = 5s

t_const = 75 / 5 = 15s

But this is from 45m to 145m, with start from rest at 45m.

Now, the total time for the journey from 1/F to 10/F to 30/F.

First, from 1/F to 10/F: as above, 14 seconds to reach 45m and stop.

Then from 10/F to 30/F: starts from 45m with v=0, accelerates to v_max, covers 12.5m in 5s, reaches 50m (since 45+12.5=57.5m? Position: from 45m, after acc, at 45 + 12.5 = 57.5m, v=5m/s.

Then from 57.5m to 145m - 12.5m = 132.5m at constant speed? Let's use the general method.

From start of this segment: position 45m, v=0

Accelerate to v=5m/s, distance 12.5m, so at position 45 + 12.5 = 57.5m, v=5m/s

Then, to reach stop at 145m, the remaining distance is 145 - 57.5 = 87.5m? No.

Better to think from the beginning of the segment.

Distance to travel from 45m to 145m is 100m.

It accelerates from 0 to 5m/s over 12.5m, so from 45m to 57.5m.

Then from 57.5m to 145m, but it needs to decelerate at 145m.

So, from 57.5m to 145m, the distance is 145 - 57.5 = 87.5m

But at constant speed, it should go until the deceleration point.

Standard: for distance d=100m from current position.

d_acc = 12.5m, so after acc, at position 45 + 12.5 = 57.5m, v=5m/s

Then, the distance to deceleration point is d - d_acc = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5m? No.

Total distance d=100m.

After acceleration, it has covered d_acc=12.5m, so remaining distance to cover is d - d_acc = 100 - 12.5 = 87.5m

But this remaining distance includes the deceleration part.

To stop at 145m, it needs to decelerate from v_max to 0 over d_dec=12.5m.

So, the lift will travel at constant speed from position 57.5m to position 145m - d_dec = 145 - 12.5 = 132.5m

Then from 132.5m to 145m, decelerate.

Distance at constant speed: from 57.5m to 132.5m, which is 132.5 - 57.5 = 75m

Yes, as I had.

Time: from 45m to 57.5m: 5 seconds (acceleration)

From 57.5m to 132.5m: 75m / 5m/s = 15 seconds

From 132.5m to 145m: 5 seconds (deceleration)

But the deceleration is from v_max to 0, so it stops at 145m.

Now, the time from 10/F to 30/F is the time from when it starts moving from 10/F.

At 10/F, it stops, so from there, it takes time to accelerate, constant speed, decelerate to 30/F.

So time from 10/F to 30/F: 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 seconds.

But this is from the point it starts from 10/F.

Now, for the total time from ground to 30/F via 10/F.

First, from ground to 10/F: 14 seconds

Then from 10/F to 30/F: 25 seconds

But when it arrives at 10/F, it stops, so the time to start from 10/F is after stopping, which takes no time, I assume.

So total time: 14 + 25 = 39 seconds.

But let's confirm the heights.

Ground: 0m

10/F: 45m

30/F: 145m

Distance from 0 to 45m: 45m

As above, time 14s

Distance from 45m to 145m: 100m

Time 25s

Total distance from 0 to 145m: 145m

d_acc = 12.5m, d_dec = 12.5m

2*d_acc = 25m, 145 > 25, so s_const = 145 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 120m

t_acc = 5s

t_dec = 5s

t_const = 120 / 5 = 24s

Total time directly from 0 to 145m: 5 + 24 + 5 = 34s

But in the journey, it stops at 45m, so it takes longer because it has to accelerate again from 45m.

In the direct case, from 0 to 145m, it accelerates to v_max, then constant speed to 145m - d_dec, then decelerates.

But with a stop at 45m, it adds the time from 0 to 45m and then from 45m to 145m, but since it stops at 45m, the motion from 0 to 45m includes deceleration at 45m, so when
