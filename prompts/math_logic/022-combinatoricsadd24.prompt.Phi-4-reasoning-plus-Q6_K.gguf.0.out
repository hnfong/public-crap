We are given 4 numbers: (4, 3, 1, 8). We need to construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24. The instructions require that we double-check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

We need to produce a valid expression that uses exactly the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) exactly once each. The instructions require that we double-check the result in the given format. The instructions require that we produce a series of attempts until we get a valid expression that uses exactly the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) exactly once each and equals 24.

We need to produce a final answer that is correct. Let's try to find a valid expression.

We have numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8. We need to use them exactly once. We can use operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation maybe? But likely only basic arithmetic operations.

We need to produce an expression that equals 24. Let's try to find one.

We have numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8. We need to use them exactly once. Let's try to see if we can combine them in some way.

One idea: 8 * 3 = 24, but then we have 4 and 1 left. But then we need to incorporate them in a way that doesn't change the result. For instance, if we multiply by 1 and then subtract 4? But that would be 24 * 1 - 4 = 20, not 24. Alternatively, if we add 4 and subtract 1, that's 24 + 3 = 27, not 24. Alternatively, if we do 8 * 3 = 24, then add (4 - 1) = 3, then 24 + 3 = 27, not 24. Alternatively, if we do 8 * 3 = 24, then subtract (4 - 1) = 3, then 24 - 3 = 21, not 24.

Maybe we can do something like: 8 * (3 + 1/4)? That equals 8 * (3.25) = 26, not 24. Alternatively, 8 * (3 + 1/4) = 8 * 3.25 = 26, not 24.

Alternatively, maybe we can do: 8 * 3 - 4 * 1 = 24 - 4 = 20, not 24.

Alternatively, maybe we can do: 8 * 3 - 4 + 1 = 24 - 4 + 1 = 21, not 24.

Alternatively, maybe we can do: 8 * 3 - 4/1 = 24 - 4 = 20, not 24.

Alternatively, maybe we can do: 8 * (3 - 1/4) = 8 * (2.75) = 22, not 24.

Alternatively, maybe we can do: 8 * (3 - 1) + 4 = 8 * 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, not 24.
