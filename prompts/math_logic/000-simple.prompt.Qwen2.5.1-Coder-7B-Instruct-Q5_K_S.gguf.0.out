Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4,897
Q4: 349*683=238,887
Q5: 6043*7489=45,557,387
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.
Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% of 80 is 20.
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The shopkeeper should give me $5 in change.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side, so the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Her mother has 3 children.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. First, perform the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Assuming each guest will have one slice, they will need 5 slices of cake.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The sale price is 80% of the original price: $25 * 0.80 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? There are 1 hour and 45 minutes left, which is 105 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? 22 people divided by 4 passengers per taxi is 5.5 taxis, so 6 taxis are needed.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. [end of text]
