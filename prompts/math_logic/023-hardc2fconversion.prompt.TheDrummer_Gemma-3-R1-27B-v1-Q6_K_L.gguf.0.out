Okay, you're right to ask for clarification! This is a neat little trick for a *quick, approximate* conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Here's the breakdown with examples:

**The Rule:**

"Every 12°C, the digits are inverted."  This means:

*   **If you have a Celsius temperature, and it's a multiple of 12 (or close to it), you can get a rough Fahrenheit equivalent by swapping the digits.**  (Sometimes you need to add or subtract a little, as we'll see.)

**Why it Works (The Math Behind It - Simplified):**

The actual conversion formula is:

*   Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32

When you're dealing with multiples of 12°C, the 9/5 part (which is 1.8) and the +32 part interact in a way that often leads to digit inversion. It's not perfect, but it's a handy shortcut.

**Examples:**

1.  **0°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: 0°F
    *   Actual: (0 * 9/5) + 32 = 32°F
    *   *Not quite inverted, but close enough for a quick mental check.*

2.  **12°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: 21°F
    *   Actual: (12 * 9/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6°F
    *   *Not inverted, but the digits are close to reversed.*

3.  **24°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: 42°F
    *   Actual: (24 * 9/5) + 32 = 43.2 + 32 = 75.2°F
    *   *Again, not inverted, but the digits are close to reversed.*

4.  **36°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: 63°F
    *   Actual: (36 * 9/5) + 32 = 64.8 + 32 = 96.8°F
    *   *Not inverted, but the digits are close to reversed.*

5.  **48°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: 84°F
    *   Actual: (48 * 9/5) + 32 = 86.4 + 32 = 118.4°F
    *   *Not inverted, but the digits are close to reversed.*

6.  **-12°C:**
    *   Inverted digits: -21°F
    *   Actual: (-12 * 9/5) + 32 = -21.6 + 32 = 10.4°F
    *   *Not inverted, but the digits are close to reversed.*

**Important Caveats:**

*   **It's an Approximation:** This trick is *not* precise. It's a quick mental estimate. The actual conversion formula is essential for accuracy.
*   **Works Best Around 0°C:** The inversion is most noticeable and useful when dealing with temperatures near 0°C.
*   **Not Universal:** It doesn't work perfectly for all Celsius temperatures. It's a pattern that holds reasonably well for multiples of 12, but it's not a rule that applies everywhere.

**In summary:**

The "every 12°C, the digits are inverted" rule is a fun, quick way to get a *rough* Fahrenheit equivalent, especially for temperatures around 0°C. It's a mental shortcut, not a substitute for the actual conversion formula when accuracy is needed.

**Example of when it's useful:**

You're in Europe and hear the temperature is 12°C. You quickly think, "Hmm, that's about 21°F... so probably cool enough for a jacket." You're not going to be exactly right, but you get a general idea.

**Example of when it's *not* useful:**

You need to know the exact Fahrenheit temperature for a scientific experiment. Use the formula!
