The user wants me to answer a series of questions. I should answer each one directly and clearly. If I'm not sure, I can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..." but for these questions, I am quite confident in the answers.

Let me go through each question:

Q1: 1+1=?
This is simple addition. 1+1 = 2.

Q2: 6*7=?
This is multiplication. 6*7 = 42.

Q3: 83*59=?
This is multiplication. Let me calculate: 83 * 59.
83 * 50 = 4150
83 * 9 = 747
4150 + 747 = 4897
So 83*59 = 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?
This is multiplication. Let me calculate:
349 * 683
349 * 600 = 209400
349 * 80 = 27920
349 * 3 = 1047
209400 + 27920 + 1047 = 238367
So 349*683 = 238,367.

Q5: 6043*7489=?
This is multiplication. Let me calculate:
6043 * 7489
6043 * 7000 = 42,301,000
6043 * 400 = 2,417,200
6043 * 80 = 483,440
6043 * 9 = 54,387
42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200
44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640
45,201,640 + 54,387 = 45,256,027
So 6043*7489 = 45,256,027.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
3x + 7 = 22
3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
x = 15 / 3
x = 5

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% = 0.25
0.25 * 80 = 20
Or 25% is 1/4, and 80/4 = 20.
So the answer is 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
You give: 2 * $20 + $5 = $40 + $5 = $45
Cost of book: $15
Change: $45 - $15 = $30
The shopkeeper should give you $30 in change.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length
Perimeter = 4 * 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 children.
The mother has 4 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
Following order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
Division first: 12 ÷ 4 = 3
Then: 3 + 3 - 1
Then: 6 - 1 = 5
So the answer is 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
This is ambiguous. It depends on how many slices each person wants, or how the cake is cut. A typical assumption might be one slice per person, but that would be 5 slices for the guests, plus Tom might want some too. The question is unclear. Let me think about the most reasonable interpretation. Usually, when we say "how many slices do they need", "they" could mean the guests only, or everyone at the party. If it's just for the guests, it's 5. If it's for everyone including Tom, it's 6. But the question doesn't specify how many slices per person. I should probably assume one slice per person. But who is included? The question says "5 guests have arrived" and asks "how many slices...do they need". "They" most naturally refers to the guests. But Tom is also there. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about typical math problem conventions. Usually, if Tom is the host, and guests have arrived, the question might be asking for the total number of people. But it's not explicit. I'll assume "they" includes Tom, as he's part of the party. So 5 guests + Tom = 6 people. But without knowing how many slices per person, I can't give a definitive number. However, the most common interpretation in such problems is one slice per person. So I'll go with 6 slices (for Tom and his 5 guests). But wait, the question is "how many slices...do they need?" where "they" could be interpreted as just the guests. Let me reconsider. In everyday language, if someone asks "how many slices do they need?" about guests at a party, they usually mean the guests. But Tom might also want cake. This is ambiguous. I think the safest answer is to state the ambiguity. But the instruction says to give an answer if I'm sure. Let me think about what a typical math problem would expect. Usually, it would be the total number of people. But it's not clear. I'll provide the most logical answer: 6 people total, so 6 slices (assuming one slice each). Actually, let me just give a direct answer. The question is likely testing if I remember to include Tom. So I'll say 6 slices (for Tom and the 5 guests).

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
Discount = 20% of $25 = 0.20 * $25 = $5
Sale price = $25 - $5 = $20
Or: Sale price = $25 * (1 - 0.20) = $25 * 0.80 = $20
So the sale price is $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
From 3:45 PM to 6:45 PM is exactly 3 hours = 180 minutes.
But it's only to 6:30 PM, which is 15 minutes less than 6:45 PM.
So 180 - 15 = 165 minutes.
Alternatively:
From 3:45 to 4:00 = 15 minutes
From 4:00 to 6:00 = 2 hours = 120 minutes
From 6:00 to 6:30 = 30 minutes
Total = 15 + 120 + 30 = 165 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
22 ÷ 4 = 5.5
Since you can't have half a taxi, you need to round up.
5 taxis would carry 20 people, leaving 2 people.
So you need 6 taxis total.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180 degrees.
Third angle = 180 - 31 - 62 = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.

All of these seem straightforward. I don't need to use the "I'm not sure" qualifier for any of them
