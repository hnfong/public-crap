Here are the answers to the questions:

Q1: 1+1= 2

Q2: 6*7= 42

Q3: 83*59= 4897

Q4: 349*683= 238,687

Q5: 6043*7489= 45,251,707

Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 => 3x = 15 => x = 5

Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: You paid $40 (2 x $20) + $5 = $45 for a $15 book. The shopkeeper should give you $45 - $15 = $30 as change.

Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes. Converting 2 hours to minutes, we get 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 45 minutes, we get 120 + 45 = 165 minutes. So, there are 165 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
