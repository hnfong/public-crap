Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

   - It is an abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60) is greater than the number itself (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 360).
   - It is a highly composite number (a number with more divisors than any smaller number) and is also the smallest number that is both a sum of two prime numbers (120 = 7 + 119) and a product of three distinct prime numbers (2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 120).
   - It is also an octagonal number, a decagonal number, and a pronic number (since it's the product of two consecutive integers, 10 * 12).
   - The number 120 can be expressed as the sum of four consecutive prime numbers (19 + 23 + 29 + 31 = 120).
   - In chemistry, there are 120 naturally occurring isotopes of elements ranging from Hydrogen (Z=1) to Uranium (Z=92).

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the factoring method:

   - Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7.
   - These two numbers are -9 and +2, as (-9) * (+2) = -18 and (-9) + (+2) = -7.
   - Therefore, we can factor the equation as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.
   - Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x: x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0.
   - The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the time it takes for a round trip and then divide the total available time in a day by that round trip time.

   - The distance between the cities is 200 km, and the average speed of the train is 60 km/h.
   - The time to travel one way (either direction) is 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.333 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes).
   - The round trip time is 2 * 3.333 hours = 6.666 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes).
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - The number of round trips the train can make in a full day is 24 hours / 6.666 hours â‰ˆ 3.59, which means the train can make 3 full round trips within a full day.<|end|>
