Let's go through each question step by step.

### **Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

**Step-by-step analysis:**

120 is a mathematically rich number. Here are some of its notable properties:

1. **Factorial**:  
   $ 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 $  
   So, 120 is the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct objects.

2. **Highly Composite Number**:  
   120 has many divisors. Let's list them:  
   Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 → **16 divisors**  
   It has more divisors than any smaller number, making it highly composite.

3. **Triangular and Tetrahedral Number**:  
   - It is not a triangular number itself, but:  
   - 120 is a **tetrahedral number**: the sum of the first 8 triangular numbers, or $ \binom{10}{3} = 120 $, representing the number of ways to choose 3 items from 10.

4. **Sum of Twin Primes**:  
   $ 59 + 61 = 120 $

5. **Sum of Powers**:  
   $ 120 = 2^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 + 64 $? No — actually, $ 2^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 + 64 = 136 $.  
   But $ 120 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100 $? No, that’s 100.  
   Actually, $ 4^3 + 4^3 + 2^3 = 64+64+8=136 $. Not quite.  
   But $ 120 = 2^3 + 2^3 + 2^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 $? Too many.  
   Let's skip — it's known as the smallest number that is the sum of two cubes in two ways? No, that’s 1729.  
   So maybe not.

6. **Angle in Pentagon**:  
   The internal angles of a regular pentagon are 108°, but 120° is the internal angle of a regular **hexagon**.

7. **In the Bible**:  
   120 years was the maximum age of a person (Genesis 6:3).

8. **In Science**:  
   120 is the atomic number of **Unbinilium (Ubn)**, a synthetic element.

**Conclusion**:  
120 is significant as 5!, a highly composite number, a tetrahedral number, and appears in geometry, combinatorics, and culture.

✅ **Answer**:  
120 is 5 factorial (5! = 120), a highly composite number with 16 divisors, a tetrahedral number ($ \binom{10}{3} $), the internal angle of a regular hexagon (120°), and appears in combinatorics, geometry, and religious texts.

### **Q2: Solve the equation: $ x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 $**

**Step-by-step solution:**

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.

**Method: Factoring**

We need two numbers that:
- Multiply to $ c = -18 $
- Add to $ b = -7 $

Let’s list factor pairs of -18:
- (1, -18): sum = -17
- (2, -9): sum = -7 ← **Yes!**
- (3, -6): sum = -3

So, we can factor:
$ x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0 $

Check:  
$ (x + 2)(x - 9) = x^2 - 9x + 2x - 18 = x^2 - 7x - 18 $ ✓

Set each factor to zero:
- $ x + 2 = 0 $ → $ x = -2 $
- $ x - 9 = 0 $ → $ x = 9 $

✅ **Answer**: $ x = -2 $ or $ x = 9 $

### **Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Distance for one round trip**:  
   One way = 200 km  
   Round trip = 200 × 2 = **400 km**

2. **Speed**: 60 km/h

3. **Time for one round trip**:  
   $ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3} $ hours ≈ 6.666... hours

4. **Time available in a full day**:  
   24 hours

5. **Number of round trips**:  
   $ \frac{24}{20/3} = 24 × \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 $

But the train cannot complete a partial round trip. So we take the **integer part**.

✅ **Answer**: 3 round trips (since 3.6 means 3 full round trips can be completed)

### **Final Answers:**

**Q1**: 120 is 5! (120), a highly composite number with 16 divisors, a tetrahedral number, the internal angle of a regular hexagon, and significant in mathematics and culture.

**Q2**: $ x = -2 $ or $ x = 9 $

**Q3**: 3 round trips
