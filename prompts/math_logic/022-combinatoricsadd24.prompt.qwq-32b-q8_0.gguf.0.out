Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).

Okay, let's see. I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 to make 24. Hmm, first, maybe I should try different combinations of operations. Let me start by thinking of multiplication since 24 is a multiple of several numbers. 

What if I multiply 8 and 3? That gives 24 right there. But then I still have 4 and 1 left. Wait, if I do 8 * 3, that's 24, but then I have to use the remaining numbers. Maybe subtract them? Like 8*3 - (4 -1) = 24 -3 = 21, which isn't right. Or maybe add them? 24 +4 +1 is 29, nope. That doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe 4 multiplied by something. 4 times 6 is 24. How can I get 6 from 3,1,8? 8 - (3-1) = 6? Let's see: 8-2 is 6. So then 4*(8 - (3-1)) = 4*6=24. Wait, does that use all the numbers? Let's check: 4, 8, 3, and 1. Yes, each is used once. Wait, but in the expression, the 3 and 1 are inside the parentheses as (3-1). So that uses all four numbers. Let me verify again: 3-1 is 2, 8-2 is 6, 4*6 is 24. That seems to work. 

Wait, but maybe I should check another way. Let me think of other possibilities. What if I do 8/(1 - 3/4)? Let's see. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. 1 minus 0.75 is 0.25. Then 8 divided by 0.25 is 32. Not 24. Hmm. 

Another approach: 4*3*1*8? That's way too big, 96. Not helpful. Maybe division. 8/(1/3) *4? Wait, 8 divided by (1/3) is 24, then times 4 would be 96 again. Not helpful. 

Wait, going back to the first idea: 4*(8 - (3 -1)). Let me write that out step by step. 3 minus 1 is 2. Then 8 minus 2 is 6. Then 4 multiplied by 6 is indeed 24. And all numbers are used exactly once. So that should be the correct expression. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me see. What if I do (4 + 1) * (8 - 3). That would be 5 *5 =25, which is close but not 24. 

Alternatively, 8 + 4 +3 +1 is 16, nope. 

How about (8 - 1) * (4 - 3). That's 7 *1 =7. Not good. 

Hmm, maybe 3*(8) + (4 -1). That would be 24 +3 =27. Not 24. 

Alternatively, 4*3*(8-1). Wait, 8-1 is 7, so 4*3*7 is 84. No. 

Wait, perhaps (4 + 3 +1) * something. 8*(4+3+1) is 8*8=64. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, 8*3 + (4 -1). That's 24 +3=27 again. 

Hmm, so the first idea seems the only one that works. Let me check again. The expression is 4 multiplied by (8 minus (3 minus 1)). So written as 4*(8 - (3-1)). Let me compute each step:

3-1 =2. Then 8-2=6. Then 4*6=24. Yes, that works. All numbers used once. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different arrangement. Like (4*3)*(8-1) but that's 12*7=84. No. 

Wait another thought: 8/(1 - 3/4). Let me recalculate that. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. 1 minus 0.75 is 0.25. 8 divided by 0.25 is 32. Not 24. 

Alternatively, (8 * 3) + (4 -1) is 24 +3=27. 

Hmm. Maybe (4 - (1/3)) *8? Let's see. 1/3 is about 0.333, so 4-0.333 is 3.666. Multiply by 8 gives around 29.333. Not 24. 

Alternatively, (8 +4) * (3 -1). That's 12 *2=24. Oh! Wait, that's another possibility. Let me check that. 

Yes, (8+4)=12, (3-1)=2. 12*2=24. And all numbers are used: 8,4,3,1. Each exactly once. So that's another valid expression. 

Oh, so there are two possible solutions here. The first one I thought of was 4*(8 - (3-1)), and this one is (8+4)*(3-1). Both are correct. 

Wait, but the problem says "construct a mathematical expression", so either would work. Let me check both again. 

First solution: 4*(8 - (3-1)) =4*(6)=24. Correct. 

Second solution: (8+4)*(3-1)=12*2=24. Correct. 

So either of these would be valid. The user might accept either. Let me see which one is simpler. The second one is perhaps simpler because it doesn't require nested parentheses. 

So the second expression is better. Let me confirm once more. 

8 plus 4 is 12, 3 minus 1 is 2. 12 multiplied by 2 is 24. Yes. All numbers used once. 

Therefore, the correct expression is (8+4)*(3-1) or 12*2. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think again. 

What about 3*(8) + (4 -1) is 24+3=27. No. 

Or 4*3*2, but where does the 2 come from? 8-6? Not sure. 

Alternatively, 8*3 - (4/1) =24 -4=20. Not 24. 

Hmm. So the two solutions I found are valid. The problem might prefer one of them. Let me see which one is more straightforward. 

The second one, (8+4)*(3-1), uses all numbers in a straightforward way. So I think that's the better answer. 

Therefore, the correct expression is (8 + 4) Ã— (3 - 1) = 24.

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: (8, 4, 3, 1). Correct!
```

The mathematical expression that results in 24 using the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8) is:

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{(8 + 4) \times (3 - 1)} [end of text]
