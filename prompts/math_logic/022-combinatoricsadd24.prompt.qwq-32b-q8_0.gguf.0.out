Okay, let's see. I need to use the numbers 4, 3, 1, and 8 to make 24. Hmm, first I should try different combinations. Maybe multiplication is key here since 24 is a multiple of several numbers. Let me think.

What if I multiply 8 and 3? That gives 24 right away. But then I still have 4 and 1 left. Oh wait, but if I do 8 times 3, that's already 24, but I have to use all four numbers. So maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe 4 multiplied by something. 4 times 6 is 24, so how can I get 6 from 3, 1, and 8? Hmm, 8 minus (3 -1) would be 8-2=6? Wait, 3-1 is 2, so 8-2 is 6. Then 4 times that 6 would be 24. Let me check that: 4*(8 - (3 -1)). Let's compute the inner parentheses first: 3-1=2, so 8-2=6. Then 4*6=24. That uses all four numbers: 4, 3, 1, 8. Wait, does that work? Let me verify again step by step. 

Yes, 3 minus 1 is 2. Subtract that from 8 gives 6. Multiply by 4 gives 24. That seems correct. But maybe there's another way. Let me think of other possibilities. 

Alternatively, maybe (8 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 7 *1 =7, nope. Not helpful. What about 8 + 4 + 3 +1? That's 16. Not enough. How about 8*(something). If I do 8*(3 +1) that's 32, then subtract 4? 32-4=28. Not 24. Hmm. 

Wait another idea: 3*(8 - (4 -1)). Let's see. 4-1 is 3, so 8-3=5. Then 3*5=15. Not enough. 

Alternatively, (4 + 1) * (8 - 3). That's 5*5=25. Close, but not 24. 

Hmm, maybe 4*(3) + 8 +1? 12+9=21. No. 

Wait, going back to the first idea: 4*(8 - (3 -1)) = 4*(6) =24. That uses all four numbers. Let me check again. The numbers are 4,3,1,8. Each is used once. Yes, that works. So the expression would be 4*(8 - (3 -1)) =24. Alternatively, maybe written as 4*(8 -3 +1) but that would be 4*(6) as well. Wait, 8-3+1 is 6, so same result. So either way, that's valid. 

Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let me see if there's another way. Like (8 + 4) * (3 -1). That's 12 *2=24. Oh! Wait, that's another possibility. Let me check that. 8+4 is 12, 3-1 is 2. 12*2=24. And all numbers are used: 8,4,3,1 each once. That works too. So that's even simpler. 

So two possible solutions: either (8+4)*(3-1) or 4*(8 - (3-1)). Both are valid. The second one might be better because it uses each number once without needing to add. Wait, in the first one, (8+4) uses 8 and 4, then (3-1) uses 3 and 1. So all four numbers are used exactly once. That's perfect. So that's a valid solution. 

So the correct expression would be (8 +4) * (3 -1) = 12 *2 =24. Let me confirm again. 8 plus 4 is 12, 3 minus 1 is 2, multiplied gives 24. Yes, that works. 

I think that's the simplest way. So the answer should be that.

```
Attempt: (8 + 4) * (3 - 1) = 12 * 2 = 24
Double checking: (8 + 4) = 12, (3 - 1) = 2, 12 * 2 = 24. Numbers used: 8, 4, 3, 1. Correct!
