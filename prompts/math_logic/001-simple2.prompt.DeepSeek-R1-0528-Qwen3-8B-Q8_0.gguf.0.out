I'll tackle each question one by one, providing steps and reasoning. If I'm unsure, I'll note that.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

First, I need to think about why 120 is significant. It's a number that appears in various contexts, so I should recall some key facts.

120 is a multiple of many numbers. Let me list its factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. It has a lot of divisors.

It's also a triangular number. Triangular numbers are the sum of the first n natural numbers. For example, the 15th triangular number is 15*16/2 = 120. So, 120 is the sum of the first 15 positive integers.

In combinatorics, 120 is the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 10, since C(10,2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10*9)/2 = 45, wait no, that's not right. C(10,2) is 45, but 120 is larger. Maybe C(10,3) or something. C(10,3) = 120. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 120 ways to choose 3 items from 10.

In factorial, 5! = 120. That's significant because factorial is fundamental in permutations and combinations.

In geometry, 120 degrees is a common angle, like in hexagons or in the context of the sum of angles in a triangle being 180, but 120 isn't directly related. In a circle, the central angle for a hexagon is 60 degrees, but for other shapes? 120 is also the angle in a regular pentagon's triangle or something? No, pentagon has 108 degrees. Anyway, it's an angle that appears in various polygons.

In time, 120 minutes is 2 hours, but that might not be particularly significant.

In binary, 120 is 1111000, which has many 1s.

But I think the most significant properties are mathematical ones. Let me think about its prime factors. 120 divided by 2 is 60, 60 by 2 is 30, 30 by 2 is 15, 15 by 3 is 5, so 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5.

It's a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Let me check: smaller numbers like 60 has 12 divisors, 120 has 16, yes, more.

In the context of the problem, it might be related to something else, but since no specific context is given, I'll go with general significance.

Another thing: in the decimal system, 120 is a multiple of 10, but not sure.

In physics, it might be related to some constants, but I doubt it.

I think for this question, I should cover the main points: it's 5!, C(10,3), triangular number, and its prime factorization.

Also, in the Bible, 120 is the number of years Noah lived, but that might be too specific and not mathematical.

Since the user didn't specify a context, I'll assume a general mathematical significance.

So, answer: 120 is significant because it is 5 factorial (5! = 120), the binomial coefficient C(10,3) = 120, and it is the 15th triangular number (sum from 1 to 15 is 120). It has many divisors and is highly composite.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

This is a quadratic equation. I can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.

First, try factoring. I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7.

Factors of -18: positive and negative pairs. Let's see, 1 and -18, sum is -17. 2 and -9, sum is -7. Yes! 2 and -9.

So, the equation is x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0.

I can write it as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0? Let me check: (x - 9)(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x - 9x - 18 = x^2 - 7x - 18. Perfect.

So, the solutions are x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, which means x = 9 or x = -2.

Using quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2 = [7 ± 11] / 2.

So, x = (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9, or x = (7 - 11)/2 = -4/2 = -2.

Same answer.

So, the solutions are x=9 and x=-2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

First, a round trip means going from city A to city B and back to city A, so total distance is 2 * 200 km = 400 km.

Average speed is 60 km/h, so time for one round trip is distance/speed = 400 km / 60 km/h.

Calculate that: 400 / 60 = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666... hours.

Now, a full day is 24 hours.

So, number of round trips in 24 hours is 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

But it can't make a fraction of a trip, so probably 3 full round trips.

But let me confirm. Time for one round trip is 20/3 hours, which is about 6.666 hours.

In 24 hours, 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Since it can't make a partial trip, it should be 3 trips.

But is the average speed given for the entire trip or per direction? The question says "average speed of 60 km/h between two cities", and "time stationed is negligible", so I think the average speed is for the round trip.

Let me read the question carefully: "A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart."

"Between two cities" might be ambiguous. Does it mean the average speed for the journey from A to B is 60 km/h, or for the round trip?

In standard interpretation, when we say average speed between two cities, it usually means for the entire trip from A to B, but here it says "between two cities", and then mentions round trips, so probably the average speed is given for the one-way trip.

But the question is about round trips, and it says "average speed of 60 km/h between two cities", which might imply the speed for the distance between them.

But in the context, it might be the speed for the round trip.

To be precise, let's assume that the average speed is for the one-way trip, as it's common to specify speed between two points.

But the question says "average speed of 60 km/h between two cities", and then "how many round trips", so I need to clarify.

Perhaps it's the average speed for the round trip.

But if it's for the one-way trip, then for a round trip, the average speed might be different if the speed is not constant, but the question doesn't specify.

This is tricky. Let me think.

Typically, average speed is total distance divided by total time.

But here, it says "travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities", which probably means for the journey from A to B, the average speed is 60 km/h.

But for a round trip, if the speed is the same in both directions, then the average speed for round trip would be different.

The question doesn't specify if the speed is constant or not.

But it says "average speed", so perhaps we assume that the average speed is given for the round trip.

To avoid confusion, let's look at the wording.

"Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?"

And "travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities".

I think "between two cities" likely refers to the one-way journey.

But for round trips, we need the time for the entire round trip.

Perhaps the average speed is for the entire trip.

Another way: in many such problems, the average speed is given for the one-way trip, and we need to find round trip time.

But let's calculate based on one-way.

If average speed for one-way is 60 km/h, distance 200 km, then time for one-way is 200 / 60 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 hours.

Then for round trip, time is 2 * 10/3 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666 hours, same as before.

But is the average speed for one-way or round trip?

The phrase "average speed of 60 km/h between two cities" typically means for the journey from A to B.

But in that case, for the round trip, if the speed is the same in both directions, then the average speed for round trip would be total distance 400 km, total time 20/3 hours, so average speed is 400 / (20/3) = 400 * 3 / 20 = 1200 / 20 = 60 km/h. Same as one-way.

Is that right? If one-way average speed is 60 km/h, and distance is same, and if speed is constant, then round trip average speed is also 60 km/h, since time is proportional.

But if speed is not constant, but average is given, it might be different, but probably we assume constant speed or same average.

In this case, since the average speed is given for the one-way, and we're to find round trips, but the average speed for round trip might not be specified.

But in the calculation above, if one-way time is 200/60 hours, then round trip time is 400/60 hours? No.

Average speed is distance over time.

If average speed for one-way is 60 km/h, distance 200 km, then time for one-way is 200 / 60 hours.

Then for round trip, distance is 400 km, but if the speed is the same in both directions, then time for round trip is 2 * (200 / 60) = 400 / 60 hours.

Then average speed for round trip is total distance / total time = 400 / (400/60) = 60 km/h. Same.

But the question is not asking for average speed, it's asking for how many round trips it can make in 24 hours.

So, regardless of whether the average speed is for one-way or round trip, as long as the speed is constant, the time for round trip is distance/speed = 400 / 60 hours.

But is the speed constant? The question doesn't specify, but probably we assume that.

Perhaps the average speed is given for the entire round trip.

But in that case, if average speed for round trip is 60 km/h, distance 400 km, then time is 400 / 60 hours, same thing.

So, in both interpretations, the time for one round trip is 400 / 60 hours.

Is that correct?

If average speed for one-way is 60 km/h, then time one-way is 200/60, round trip time is 2*200/60 = 400/60.

If average speed for round trip is 60 km/h, then time round trip is 400/60.

Same.

But is the average speed necessarily the same for both directions? Probably assumed.

Moreover, the time stationed is negligible, so no issue there.

So, time for one round trip: 400 km / 60 km/h = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 hours.

Full day: 24 hours.

Number of round trips: 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Since it can't make a fraction of a trip, it can make 3 full round trips.

But 3.6 means it can start a fourth trip but not complete it.

The question is "how many round trips can it make", which might imply complete round trips.

So, probably 3.

But let me confirm the units. Speed is in km/h, distance in km, time in hours, day is 24 hours, so yes.

Perhaps I need to consider if the trip can be interrupted, but the question says "can it make", probably meaning complete trips.

Another thing: is the average speed given for the trip including stops or not? But it says time stationed is negligible, so probably the speed is for the moving part.

But in any case, for the journey, the average speed is given, so time is distance/average speed.

So, I think 3 is the answer.

But let me calculate exactly.

20/3 hours per round trip.

24 hours.

24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Yes.

To be thorough, let's see the time for one-way: 200 / 60 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 hours.

Round trip: 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 hours.

In 24 hours, number of round trips: floor(24 / (20/3)) = floor(3.6) = 3.

Since 3 * 20/3 = 20 hours, and 24 - 20 = 4 hours, which is less than 20/3 ≈ 6.6667, so not enough for a fourth trip.

So, answer is 3.

But is there any trick here? The question says "average speed of 60 km/h between two cities", and for round trip, if the speed is different in each direction, but the average is given, it might be complicated, but probably not.

Perhaps "between two cities" means the speed is 60 km/h for the distance, but direction might matter, but I think it's standard to assume the average speed is for the entire trip or per direction as specified.

But in this case, it doesn't specify direction, so likely for one-way.

But as calculated, it doesn't matter.

Another interpretation: sometimes "average speed between A and B" means the speed when going from A to B, but for round trip, we need to consider both ways.

But if the average speed is the same for both ways, then it's fine.

I think it's safe to assume that.

So, for Q3, answer is 3.

Now, to summarize:

Q1: 120 is significant as it is 5! (120), the binomial coefficient C(10,3) = 120, and the 15th triangular number (sum from 1 to 15 is 120). It is highly composite with 16 divisors.

Q2: Solutions are x=9 and x=-2.

Q3: 3 round trips.

But for Q1, I should provide more properties if possible.

120 is also the least common multiple of many numbers, but not sure.

In combinatorics, it's the number of ways to choose 3 out of 10.

In algebra, it's a factorial.

In number theory, it's a factorial number.

Also, it's divisible by all integers up to 5, since 120/1=120, /2=60, /3=40, /4=30, /5=24, all integers.

But that's a property.

I think I've covered it.

Now, for the answer, I need to box it.

The user said "Give the answer for all these questions", so probably provide answers separately.

But in the end, box the final answer, but since there are three questions, perhaps box each or something.

I think I'll provide the answers clearly.

Also, for Q2, it's straightforward.

For Q3, I think 3 is correct.

But let me double-check the time.

Distance one-way: 200 km.

Speed: 60 km/h.

Time one-way: 200/60 = 10/3 hours.

Round trip: 2 * 10/3 = 20/3 hours.

24 hours.

24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Yes, 3 complete trips.

Perhaps the day includes 24 hours, but the train might start at a certain time, but no, it's a full day, so probably from midnight to midnight.

But still, 3.6 means it can't complete 4 trips.

Unless the average speed is defined differently, but I think not.

Another thing: is the average speed for the entire round trip or per leg?

But as I thought earlier, if average speed is given for one-way, and we assume same for return, then it's fine.

If the average speed is for the round trip, same calculation.

But suppose the average speed is for the round trip, then time is 400/60 = 20/3 hours, same.

But if the average speed is different for each direction, but the question doesn't specify, so probably not.

I think it's correct.

So, answers:

Q1: 120 is the factorial of 5, the binomial coefficient C(10,3), and the 15th triangular number. It is highly composite.

Q2: x = 9 or x = -2

Q3: 3

Now, to present it.
</think>
**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 is significant in mathematics for several reasons. It is the factorial of 5, denoted as 5! = 120. It is also the binomial coefficient C(10,3) = 120, which represents the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 10. Additionally, 120 is the 15th triangular number, as it is the sum of the first 15 positive integers: 1 + 2 + ... + 15 = 120.

Other interesting properties include:
- 120 is highly composite, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 (16 divisors in total).
- It is divisible by all integers from 1 to 5, as 120 / 1 = 120, 120 / 2 = 60, 120 / 3 = 40, 120 / 4 = 30, and 120 / 5 = 24.
- In geometry, 120 degrees is a common angle, such as in a regular hexagon where each internal angle is 120 degrees.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

This is a quadratic equation. To solve it, I use factoring. I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. The numbers 2 and -9 satisfy this condition because 2 * (-9) = -18 and 2 + (-9) = -7.

Thus, the equation factors as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:
- x - 9 = 0 ⇒ x = 9
- x + 2 = 0 ⇒ x = -2

I can verify this using the quadratic formula: x = [7 ± √(7² - 4*1*(-18))] / 2 = [7 ± √(49 + 72)] / 2 = [7 ± √121] / 2 = [7 ± 11] / 2.

This gives x = (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 = 9 and x = (7 - 11)/2 = -4/2 = -2, confirming the solutions.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

A round trip consists of traveling from one city to the other and back, so the total distance for one round trip is 2 * 200 km = 400 km.

The average speed is 60 km/h, and the time stationed is negligible, so the time for one round trip is calculated as total distance divided by average speed: 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.6667 hours.

A full day is 24 hours. The number of complete round trips that can be made is found by dividing the total time by the time per round trip: 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3 / 20 = 72 / 20 = 3.6.

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 complete round trips. After 3 trips, 3 * (20/3) = 20 hours have passed, leaving 4 hours. This is insufficient for a fourth round trip, as 4 < 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 hours. [end of text]
