"Theeasiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

So they want an explanation of the statement: "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted." They want examples. They also say "You may start over with your answer if you think you may have made a mistake when answering." So they want a thorough explanation, maybe with examples, and they are okay with me starting over if I think I made a mistake.

Thus I need to explain the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit, the conversion formula, and the pattern that for every 12°C, the digits are inverted. I need to explain that the conversion formula is F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Then show that for C = 12, F = (12 * 9/5) + 32 = (108/5) + 32 = 21.6 + 32 = 53.6. The digits of 12 are 1 and 2, and the digits of 53.6 are 5 and 3 (if you ignore decimal). Not exactly inverted. But maybe they mean something else: For each 12°C increase, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed? Let's test: C=0 => F=32. Digits of 0? Not sure. C=12 => F=53.6 (approx 54). Digits of 12 reversed is 21, not 53. So maybe they refer to the pattern that for each 12°C, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed relative to the Celsius reading? That doesn't hold. Or maybe they refer to the pattern that for each 12°C, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed relative to the Celsius reading's digits? That also doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe they refer to the pattern that for each 12°C, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed relative to the Celsius reading's digits? Let's test: C=12 => F=53.6 (approx 54). Digits of 12 reversed is 21, not 53. So no.

Maybe they refer to the pattern that for each 12°C, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed relative to the Celsius reading's digits plus 32? That seems weird.

Alternatively, maybe they refer to the pattern that for each 12°C, the Fahrenheit reading's digits are reversed relative to the Celsius reading's digits plus 32? That also seems weird.
