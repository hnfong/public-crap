◁think▷Okay, let's tackle each question one by one.

First, Q1: What's the significance of the number 120? I need to recall some interesting properties. Hmm, 120 is a factorial number, right? Because 5! is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. That's a key point. Also, it's a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Let me check the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. That's a lot. So it's a practical number for various divisions. Another thing, in geometry, a regular icosahedron has 120 edges. Also, in time, there are 120 minutes in two hours. But maybe the most significant is being 5 factorial, which is fundamental in permutations and combinations.

Next, Q2: Solve the equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0. I need to factor this quadratic equation. Let's find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. Let's see: possible pairs are (1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6). Wait, 2 and -9 multiply to -18, and 2 + (-9) is -7. So the factors would be (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0. Setting each factor to zero gives x = -2 or x = 9. So the solutions are x = -2 and x = 9.

Now, Q3: A train travels at 60 km/h between two cities 200 km apart. How many round trips can it make in a full day (24 hours)? First, calculate the time for one way. Distance is 200 km, speed is 60 km/h. Time = distance/speed = 200/60 ≈ 3.33 hours. A round trip is twice that, so 6.66 hours. Now, in 24 hours, how many round trips can fit? 24 divided by 6.66 is about 3.6. Since you can't have a fraction of a trip, the train can make 3 full round trips. Wait, but maybe the last trip starts within the 24 hours. Let me check: 3 round trips would take 3 * 6.66 = 19.98 hours. Then there's about 4 hours left. But a single one-way trip takes 3.33 hours. So after 3 round trips (6.66 * 3 = 19.98), the train could start another trip. Let's see: 24 - 19.98 = 4.02 hours. That's enough for another one-way trip (3.33 hours) and maybe part of the return. But since the question asks for complete round trips, 3 is correct. Wait, but maybe the train can do 4 round trips if it's timed right. Wait, 4 round trips would be 4 * 6.66 = 26.64 hours, which is more than 24. So definitely 3 round trips. So the answer is 3.

Wait, but maybe the train can start a fourth trip and return within 24 hours. Let me think: If the train starts at time 0, does a round trip in 6.66 hours (ends at 6.66), then another (ends at 13.32), then another (ends at 19.98). Then, with 4.02 hours left, it can do another one-way (3.33 hours), reaching the other city at 23.31, but then can't return. So only 3 round trips. So the answer is 3.

So putting it all together:

For Q1: The number 120 is significant because it's 5 factorial (5!), a highly composite number with many divisors, and appears in geometry like the icosahedron's edges.

For Q2: The solutions are x = -2 and x = 9.

For Q3: The train can make 3 round trips in a full day.

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
- It is 5 factorial (5!), which is fundamental in combinatorics
- It's a highly composite number with 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120)
- It's the number of edges in a regular icosahedron
- It represents 2 hours in minutes (60 * 2 = 120)

Q2: The solutions to the equation x² - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = -2 and x = 9. This can be found by factoring the quadratic into (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0.

Q3: The train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. Each round trip takes 200km * 2 / 60km/h = 6.67 hours, and 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.6, which rounds down to 3 complete trips. [end of text]
