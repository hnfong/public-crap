### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics, science, and culture. Here are some of its notable properties:

1. **Factorial:** 120 is the factorial of 5, i.e., \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

2. **Triangular Number:** 120 is a triangular number, which means it can form an equilateral triangle. The formula for the \(n\)-th triangular number is \(T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 15\), \(T_{15} = \frac{15 \times 16}{2} = 120\).

3. **Highly Composite Number:** 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

4. **Age in Ancient Texts:** In the Bible, the age of 120 is mentioned as the maximum age for humans (Genesis 6:3).

5. **Geometry:** The icosahedron, one of the Platonic solids, has 20 triangular faces and 120 edges if considering its dual (dodecahedron).

6. **Time Measurement:** The number 120 is used in some time measurements, such as the 120-second (2-minute) rule in some sports.

7. **Decimal System:** 120 is a Harshad number in base 10, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 ÷ 3 = 40).

### Q2: Solve the equation: \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Answer:**

To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -18\). Plugging these values into the formula:

1. Calculate the discriminant (\(D\)):
   \[ D = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
   \[ \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Apply the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Solve for the two possible values of \(x\):
   \[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
   \[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

**Final Answer:** The solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -2\).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**

To determine how many round trips the train can make in a full day (24 hours), follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time for one round trip:**
   - Distance between the two cities: 200 km.
   - Round trip distance: \(2 \times 200 = 400\) km.
   - Speed of the train: 60 km/h.
   - Time for one round trip: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400}{60} = \frac{20}{3}\) hours ≈ 6.666... hours.

2. **Calculate the number of round trips in 24 hours:**
   - Number of round trips = \(\frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per round trip}} = \frac{24}{\frac{20}{3}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6\).

Since the train cannot complete a fraction of a round trip, it can make **3 full round trips** in a day.

**Final Answer:** The train can make 3 round trips in a full day. [end of text]
