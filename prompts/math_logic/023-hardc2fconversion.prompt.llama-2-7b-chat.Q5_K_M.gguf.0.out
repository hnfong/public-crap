"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."
 [/INST]  No mistake! This statement is correct. When converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use the following formula:
°F = (°C × 1.8) + 32
And here's the important part: every 12°C, the digits are inverted.
Let me illustrate this with some examples:
* 0°C = 32°F (no digits are inverted)
* 12°C = 50°F (the digits are inverted)
* 24°C = 75°F (the digits are inverted)
* 36°C = 97°F (the digits are inverted)
As you can see, every 12°C, the digits are inverted in the Fahrenheit temperature reading. This makes it easier to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, as you only need to remember that every 12°C, the digits are inverted.
