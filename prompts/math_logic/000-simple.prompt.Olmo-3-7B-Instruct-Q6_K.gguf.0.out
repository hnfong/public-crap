Here are my answers to each question, following your instruction to say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..." if uncertain.

---

**Q1: 1+1=?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is 2.

---

**Q2: 6*7=?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is 42.

---

**Q3: 83*59=?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is 4897 (because 80*60=4800, so close to that).

---

**Q4: 349*683=?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is 238, 417 (but I might have miscalculated; let me estimate: 350*680=238,000, so probably around there).

---

**Q5: 6043*7489=?**  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is a large number, possibly around 45 million (since 6000*7500=45,000,000, so close).

---

**Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.**  
I think the answer is x = 5.  
(Explanation: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15 → x = 15/3 = 5)

---

**Q7: What is 25% of 80?**  
I think the answer is 20 (because 25% is 1/4, and 80/4 = 20).

**Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?**  
I think the total given is $20 + $20 + $5 = $45. The cost is $15, so change should be $45 - $15 = $30. But since the shopkeeper probably gives change from the $20s and $5, maybe she gives $20 in smaller bills and keeps the rest? But the question asks for the final change I should get, so I think it's $30.  
(I am not sure, but I think the answer is $30.)

**Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.**  
I think the answer is 20 (because perimeter = 4 × side = 4 × 5 = 20).

---

**Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?**  
I think the answer is 4.  
(Explanation: Two brothers + Katherine + sister = 4 children)

---

**Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1**  
I think the answer is 8.  
(Explanation: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 → 3 + 3 - 1 = 5? Wait, order of operations: 3 + (12/4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me recalculate: 12 ÷ 4 = 3; 3 + 3 = 6; 6 - 1 = 5. So the answer should be 5. I was wrong above.  
I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5.)

**Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?**  
I think the answer depends on how many slices each guest wants, but usually one slice per guest, so 5 slices.  
(I am not sure, but I think the answer is 5.)

---

**Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?**  
I think the answer is $20.  
(Explanation: 20% of 25 is 5, so 25 - 5 = 20)

---

**Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?**  
I think the answer is 105 minutes.  
(Explanation: From 3:45 to 6:00 is 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes. From 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes. Total = 135 + 30 = 165? Wait, no, that's wrong. Let's do it step by step:  
From 3:45 to 6:30 is 2 hours and 45 minutes. 2 hours = 120 minutes, 45 minutes = 45, so 120 + 45 = 165 minutes? Wait, but from 3:45 to 6:00 is 1 hour 15 minutes = 75 minutes. Then 6:00 to 6:30 is 30 minutes. So total is 75 + 30 = 105 minutes. Yes.)

---

**Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?**  
I think the answer is 6 taxis (because 22 ÷ 4 = 5.5, so you need 6 taxis).

---

**Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?**  
I think the answer is 87 degrees (because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180; 180 - 31 - 62 = 87).
