Okay, let’s tackle these questions one by one.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

*   **Mathematical Significance:** 120 is a particularly interesting number in mathematics. It’s the product of two prime numbers: 3 x 40 = 120.
*   **Fibonacci Sequence:** It’s the 120th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
*   **Golden Ratio:** It’s approximately equal to the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618). This is a fundamental concept in geometry and art.
*   **Cube Root of 240:** It’s the cube root of 240.
*   **Other Uses:** It appears in various formulas and has been used in cryptography and other fields.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring:

1.  **Factor the quadratic expression:**
    (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

2.  **Solve for x:**
    *   x - 9 = 0  =>  x = 9
    *   x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2

Therefore, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Here's how to calculate this:

1.  **Calculate the total travel time:**
    *   Distance = 200 km
    *   Speed = 60 km/h
    *   Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

2.  **Determine the number of round trips:**
    *   A round trip consists of two journeys.
    *   Number of round trips = Total time / Time per round trip = 3.33 hours / 2 = 1.665 round trips.

3.  **Round down to the nearest whole number:** Since you can't make a fraction of a round trip, we round down to 1.

**Answer:** The train can make 1 round trip between the two cities within a full day.
