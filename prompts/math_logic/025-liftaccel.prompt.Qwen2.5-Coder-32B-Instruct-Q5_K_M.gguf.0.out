Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Sure, let's solve these problems step by step.

### Problem 1: Time to get from the ground floor to the top floor

**Given:**
- Building height: 40 floors
- Height per floor: 5 meters
- Total height: \(40 \times 5 = 200\) meters
- Acceleration/deceleration: \(1 \, \text{m/s}^2\)
- Maximum speed: \(5 \, \text{m/s}\)

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time to accelerate to maximum speed:**
   \[
   v = u + at \implies 5 = 0 + 1 \cdot t \implies t = 5 \, \text{seconds}
   \]
   Distance covered during acceleration:
   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 \cdot 5 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 5^2 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to decelerate from maximum speed:**
   \[
   v = u + at \implies 0 = 5 + (-1) \cdot t \implies t = 5 \, \text{seconds}
   \]
   Distance covered during deceleration:
   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 5 \cdot 5 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-1) \cdot 5^2 = 25 - 12.5 = 12.5 \, \text{meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance covered at maximum speed:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 200 \, \text{meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance covered at max speed} = 200 - 12.5 - 12.5 = 175 \, \text{meters}
   \]
   Time to cover this distance at max speed:
   \[
   t = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

4. **Total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 5 \, \text{seconds (acceleration)} + 35 \, \text{seconds (constant speed)} + 5 \, \text{seconds (deceleration)} = 45 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

### Problem 2: Time for two people to reach 10/F and 30/F

**Given:**
- First person goes to 10/F (height: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) meters)
- Second person goes to 30/F (height: \(30 \times 5 = 150\) meters)

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the time for the lift to reach 10/F:**
   - Acceleration to max speed: \(5 \, \text{seconds}\)
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \(12.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Remaining distance to 10/F: \(50 - 12.5 = 37.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Time to cover remaining distance at max speed:
     \[
     t = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{37.5}{5} = 7.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
   - Total time to reach 10/F:
     \[
     5 + 7.5 = 12.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time for the lift to reach 30/F from 10/F:**
   - Distance from 10/F to 30/F: \(150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Acceleration to max speed: \(5 \, \text{seconds}\)
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \(12.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Remaining distance to 30/F: \(100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Time to cover remaining distance at max speed:
     \[
     t = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
   - Total time to reach 30/F from 10/F:
     \[
     5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

3. **Total time for both people:**
   - First person reaches 10/F in \(12.5 \, \text{seconds}\)
   - Second person reaches 30/F in \(12.5 + 22.5 = 35 \, \text{seconds}\)

### Problem 3: Minimum time to reach 40/F with a stop

**Given:**
- First person goes to 40/F
- Second person goes to some floor between 1/F and 40/F

**Steps:**

1. **Optimal strategy:**
   - The lift should stop at a floor where the second person can get off, and then continue to 40/F.
   - The optimal floor to stop at is the one that minimizes the total travel time.

2. **Consider stopping at the midpoint (20/F):**
   - Distance to 20/F: \(20 \times 5 = 100 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Acceleration to max speed: \(5 \, \text{seconds}\)
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \(12.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Remaining distance to 20/F: \(100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Time to cover remaining distance at max speed:
     \[
     t = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
   - Total time to reach 20/F:
     \[
     5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

3. **Time to reach 40/F from 20/F:**
   - Distance from 20/F to 40/F: \(200 - 100 = 100 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Acceleration to max speed: \(5 \, \text{seconds}\)
   - Distance covered during acceleration: \(12.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Remaining distance to 40/F: \(100 - 12.5 = 87.5 \, \text{meters}\)
   - Time to cover remaining distance at max speed:
     \[
     t = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{87.5}{5} = 17.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
   - Total time to reach 40/F from 20/F:
     \[
     5 + 17.5 = 22.5 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

4. **Total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 22.5 \, \text{seconds (to 20/F)} + 22.5 \, \text{seconds (to 40/F)} = 45 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

Thus, the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F, with a stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F, is **45 seconds**. [end of text]
