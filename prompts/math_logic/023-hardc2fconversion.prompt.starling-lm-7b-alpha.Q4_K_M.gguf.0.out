This means that for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits in the temperature value will switch places when converting to Fahrenheit. Here are some examples to illustrate this:

1. If the temperature is 12°C, it will be 53.6°F in Fahrenheit. Here, the digits 1 and 2 are inverted.
2. If the temperature is 24°C, it will be 75.2°F in Fahrenheit. Again, the digits 2 and 4 are inverted.
3. If the temperature is 36°C, it will be 96.8°F in Fahrenheit. The digits 3 and 6 are inverted.
4. If the temperature is 48°C, it will be 118.4°F in Fahrenheit. The digits 4 and 8 are inverted.
5. If the temperature is 60°C, it will be 140°F in Fahrenheit. The digits 6 and 0 are inverted.

As you can see, for every 12 degrees Celsius, the digits in the temperature value will switch places when converting to Fahrenheit. This can be a helpful mnemonic for remembering the conversion formula between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures.
