I'd be happy to help with the questions!

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in various fields:

1. **Divisibility**: 120 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, and 60.
2. **Geometry**: 120 is the number of degrees in a semicircle and the number of sides of a regular icosagon (a polygon with 120 sides).
3. **Music**: 120 is the number of beats in a minute, and it's also the number of seconds in 2 minutes.
4. **Astronomy**: 120 is the number of seconds in 2 minutes, which is also the number of seconds in 1 minute and 20 seconds.
5. **Mathematics**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, and 60) than any smaller number.

These are just a few examples of the many interesting properties and significance of the number 120.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

Solving for x, we get two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 9
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To find the number of round trips, we need to calculate the time it takes for the train to make one round trip and then divide the total number of hours in a day by that time.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at 60 km/h. The time it takes to travel from one city to the other is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since the train makes a round trip, we need to double the time:

Total time for one round trip = 2 x 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours

There are 24 hours in a full day, so we can divide the total number of hours in a day by the time it takes for one round trip:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.67 hours
Number of round trips ≈ 3.6

Since we can't make a fraction of a round trip, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of round trips ≈ 3

Therefore, the train can make approximately 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
