**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

120 is a significant number with several interesting properties:

1. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. It has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

2. **Factorial**: 120 is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).

3. **Sum of Divisors**: The sum of the proper divisors of 120 (excluding itself) is 240, which is a perfect number.

4. **Hexagonal Number**: 120 is a hexagonal number, meaning it can form a regular hexagon.

5. **Common Usage**: 120 is commonly used in various contexts, such as:
   - 120 degrees is the angle of a regular pentagon.
   - 120 volts is a common voltage for electrical outlets in the United States.
   - 120 beats per minute is a common target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

where a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

1. Calculate the discriminant (Δ):

Δ = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:

√Δ = √121 = 11

3. Plug the values into the quadratic formula:

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

4. Calculate the two possible solutions:

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

1. Calculate the time taken for one one-way trip:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 20/6 hours = 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours

2. Calculate the time taken for a round trip (two one-way trips):

Round Trip Time = 2 × (10/3) hours = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666 hours

3. Calculate the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours):

Number of Round Trips = Total Time / Round Trip Time = 24 hours / (20/3) hours = 24 × (3/20) = 72/20 = 18/5 = 3.6

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a day.

However, let's check the remaining time after 3 round trips:

Time for 3 round trips = 3 × (20/3) hours = 20 hours

Remaining time = 24 hours - 20 hours = 4 hours

In the remaining 4 hours, the train can make another one-way trip (which takes 10/3 hours ≈ 3.333 hours), but it won't have enough time to return before the day ends.

Therefore, the train can make 3 full round trips and an additional one-way trip, totaling 7 one-way trips or 3.5 round trips. But since we typically count full round trips, the answer is 3 round trips.

I am not sure, but I think the answer is 3 round trips. [end of text]
