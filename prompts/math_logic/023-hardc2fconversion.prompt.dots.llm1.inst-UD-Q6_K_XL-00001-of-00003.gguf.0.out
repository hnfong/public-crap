The statement suggests a simple mnemonic or pattern to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. Specifically, it claims that for every 12°C increase, the digits of the temperature in Celsius are "inverted" when converted to Fahrenheit. 

### What does "inverted" mean here?
"Inverted" means that the digits of the Celsius temperature are reversed to form the Fahrenheit temperature. For example:
- 12°C → 54°F (digits "1" and "2" become "2" and "1" → "21" is part of 54°F).
- 24°C → 75°F (digits "2" and "4" become "4" and "2" → "42" is part of 75°F).
- 36°C → 97°F (digits "3" and "6" become "6" and "3" → "63" is part of 97°F).

### How accurate is this pattern?
The pattern holds for multiples of 12°C, but it's not exact for all temperatures. Here's why:
- The actual conversion formula is:  
  \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
- For \( C = 12 \):  
  \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 12 + 32 = 53.6 \approx 54 \).
- For \( C = 24 \):  
  \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 24 + 32 = 75.2 \approx 75 \).
- For \( C = 36 \):  
  \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times 36 + 32 = 96.8 \approx 97 \).

The pattern works because the \( \frac{9}{5} \) multiplier and the +32 adjustment create a sequence where the digits are inverted for every 12°C increment. However, it's not a general rule for all temperatures, just a helpful mnemonic for multiples of 12°C.

### Examples:
1. **12°C → 54°F**  
   - Digits "1" and "2" in Celsius become "2" and "1" in Fahrenheit (54°F).

2. **24°C → 75°F**  
   - Digits "2" and "4" in Celsius become "4" and "2" in Fahrenheit (75°F).

3. **36°C → 97°F**  
   - Digits "3" and "6" in Celsius become "6" and "3" in Fahrenheit (97°F).

### Limitations:
- The pattern breaks down for non-multiples of 12°C. For example:
  - 0°C → 32°F (not digit inversion).
  - 100°C → 212°F (not digit inversion).

### Conclusion:
This is a fun and memorable pattern for converting multiples of 12°C to Fahrenheit, but it’s not a universal rule. It’s most useful for quick approximations or remembering key temperature conversions. For precise conversions, use the formula \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \). [end of text]
