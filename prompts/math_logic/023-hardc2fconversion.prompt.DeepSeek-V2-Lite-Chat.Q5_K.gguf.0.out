"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."


Assistant: 1. Understand the task: You want me to explain what the given statement means, with examples, and correct any mistakes if I think there are any.

2. Explain the statement:
The statement is about converting Celsius (°C) temperatures to Fahrenheit (°F). It suggests that there is an easy way to remember the conversion formula, which involves inverting the digits every 12°C.

3. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:
The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
°F = °C * 9/5 + 32

4. Apply the statement to examples:
Let's convert some temperatures using the statement's guideline.

Example 1: Convert 25°C to Fahrenheit
Step 1: Identify how many "12°C" units are in 25°C: 25 / 12 = 2 (rounded down).
Step 2: Since there are 2 complete "12°C" units (2 * 12 = 24), there is no need to adjust the last digit.
Step 3: Apply the conversion formula: °F = 25 * 9/5 + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77°F

Example 2: Convert 38°C to Fahrenheit
Step 1: Identify how many "12°C" units are in 38°C: 38 / 12 = 3 (rounded down).
Step 2: Since there are 3 complete "12°C" units (3 * 12 = 36), the last digit of the Celsius temperature should be inverted.
Step 3: Apply the conversion formula: °F = 38 * 9/5 + 32 = 72.4 + 32 = 104.4°F

5. Conclusion:
The statement is suggesting that to easily convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can remember the conversion formula and invert the last digit every 12°C. However, the examples show that this method is not entirely accurate, as it doesn't account for the actual formula used to convert temperatures. Nonetheless, it can still be a useful mnemonic device for remembering the conversion.
