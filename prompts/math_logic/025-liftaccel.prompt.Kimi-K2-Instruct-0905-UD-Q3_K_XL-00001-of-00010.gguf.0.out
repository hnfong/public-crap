We are given:

- 40-story building  
- Each floor is 5 meters tall  
- Lift acceleration/deceleration = 1 m/s²  
- Maximum speed = 5 m/s  

We will solve **all three questions** step by step.

---

### **Question 1: How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F)?**

#### Step 1: Total vertical distance
From 1/F to 40/F is 39 floors (since 1/F is ground level).  
Each floor is 5 meters, so:

\[
\text{Distance} = 39 \times 5 = 195 \text{ meters}
\]

#### Step 2: Motion profile
The lift accelerates at 1 m/s² until it reaches 5 m/s, then cruises at 5 m/s, then decelerates at 1 m/s² to stop.

We need to check if the lift reaches max speed before needing to decelerate.

#### Step 3: Time to accelerate to 5 m/s
\[
v = at \Rightarrow t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \text{ seconds}
\]

Distance during acceleration:
\[
s = \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1)(5^2) = 12.5 \text{ meters}
\]

Same for deceleration: 12.5 meters and 5 seconds.

So total distance for acceleration + deceleration = 25 meters  
Remaining distance at constant speed:
\[
195 - 25 = 170 \text{ meters}
\]

Time at constant speed:
\[
t = \frac{170}{5} = 34 \text{ seconds}
\]

#### Step 4: Total time
\[
\text{Total time} = 5 + 34 + 5 = \boxed{44 \text{ seconds}}
\]

### **Question 2: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?**

This is a **shared ride**: the lift stops at 10/F and then continues to 30/F.

We need to compute **total time** from 1/F → 10/F → 30/F.

#### Step 1: 1/F → 10/F
This is 9 floors = 45 meters

Check if 45 meters is enough to reach 5 m/s and decelerate.

We already know:
- Acceleration phase: 12.5 m in 5 s
- Deceleration phase: 12.5 m in 5 s  
Total = 25 m < 45 m → so lift **does** reach 5 m/s

So:
- Accelerate 12.5 m in 5 s
- Decelerate 12.5 m in 5 s  
Remaining = 45 - 25 = 20 m at 5 m/s → 4 s

\[
\text{Time 1/F → 10/F} = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \text{ seconds}
\]

#### Step 2: 10/F → 30/F
This is 20 floors = 100 meters

Same logic:
- Accelerate 12.5 m in 5 s
- Decelerate 12.5 m in 5 s  
Remaining = 100 - 25 = 75 m at 5 m/s → 15 s

\[
\text{Time 10/F → 30/F} = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 \text{ seconds}
\]

#### Step 3: Total time
\[
\boxed{14 + 25 = 39 \text{ seconds}}
\]

### **Question 3: Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?**

We want the **minimum possible time** to reach 40/F **with exactly one intermediate stop**.

So we need to **choose the optimal floor** to stop at between 1/F and 40/F to **minimize total time**.

Let’s denote the intermediate stop floor as **x/F**, where 2 ≤ x ≤ 39.

We want to **minimize**:
\[
T(x) = \text{time from 1/F → x/F} + \text{time from x/F → 40/F}
\]

We already know from Q1 that **nonstop 1/F → 40/F** takes 44 seconds.

So we want to **minimize the extra time** caused by the intermediate stop.

#### Key insight:
The **fastest** intermediate stop is the one that **minimizes the total time**, and since the lift must **fully stop and restart**, the **best** stop is the one that **minimizes the total distance traveled at less than 5 m/s**.

But here's the key: **the lift must decelerate to 0 m/s at x/F**, and then **accelerate again from 0 m/s**, so **each segment** (1/F → x/F and x/F → 40/F) is a **full acceleration-cruise-deceleration profile**.

So we can **compute the time for each segment** as a function of x.

Let’s define:

- Distance from 1/F to x/F = (x - 1) × 5 meters  
- Distance from x/F to 40/F = (40 - x) × 5 meters  

We now compute the time for each segment using the same method as in Q1.

Let’s write a small formula for time to travel distance **d** under acceleration 1 m/s², max speed 5 m/s:

#### Time to travel distance d:
Let:
- \( t_{\text{acc}} = 5 \text{ s} \)
- \( d_{\text{acc}} = 12.5 \text{ m} \)

If \( d \leq 25 \text{ m} \), the lift **never reaches 5 m/s**, so we use:
\[
t = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{d}{a}} = 2 \times \sqrt{d}
\]

If \( d > 25 \text{ m} \), then:
\[
t = 5 + \frac{d - 25}{5} + 5 = \frac{d}{5} + 10
\]

So we can write:

\[
T(x) = 
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{5(x - 1)} + 2\sqrt{5(40 - x)}, & \text{if } 5(x - 1) \leq 25 \text{ and } 5(40 - x) \leq 25 \\
\frac{5(x - 1)}{5} + 10 + 2\sqrt{5(40 - x)}, & \text{if } 5(x - 1) > 25 \text{ and } 5(40 - x) \leq 25 \\
2\sqrt{5(x - 1)} + \frac{5(40 - x)}{5} + 10, & \text{if } 5(x - 1) \leq 25 \text{ and } 5(40 - x) > 25 \\
\frac{5(x - 1)}{5} + 10 + \frac{5(40 - x)}{5} + 10, & \text{if both } > 25
\end{cases}
\]

Simplify:

\[
T(x) = 
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{5(x - 1)} + 2\sqrt{5(40 - x)}, & x \leq 6 \text{ and } x \geq 35 \\
(x - 1) + 10 + 2\sqrt{5(40 - x)}, & x > 6 \text{ and } x \geq 35 \\
2\sqrt{5(x - 1)} + (40 - x) + 10, & x \leq 6 \text{ and } x < 35 \\
(x - 1) + 10 + (40 - x) + 10 = 59, & 6 < x < 35
\end{cases}
\]

So for **6 < x < 35**, the total
