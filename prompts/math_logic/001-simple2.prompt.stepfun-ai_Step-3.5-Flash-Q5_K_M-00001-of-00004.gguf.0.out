Okay, let's go through each question one by one.

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

First, I need to recall properties of 120. It's a composite number. Let me factor it: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. So it's highly composite? Actually, highly composite numbers have more divisors than any smaller number. Let's check divisors: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120. That's 16 divisors. Is that the most for numbers less than 120? For example, 60 has 12 divisors, 84 has 12, 90 has 12, 96 has 12, 108 has 12, so yes, 120 has 16, which is more than any smaller number, so it is highly composite. Also, it's the smallest number with 16 divisors? Not sure, but it's known as a highly composite number.

120 is also a factorial: 5! = 120. So it's the factorial of 5.

It's also a triangular number? Triangular numbers are n(n+1)/2. For n=15, 15*16/2=120, so yes, 120 is triangular.

It's also a tetrahedral number? Tetrahedral numbers are n(n+1)(n+2)/6. For n=8, 8*9*10/6=720/6=120, so yes, tetrahedral.

It's the sum of the first 15 positive integers? That's the triangular number part.

It's also the smallest number that can be expressed as a product of three consecutive primes? 2*3*5=30, not 120. 3*5*7=105, 5*7*11=385, so no. But 120=2^3*3*5, so not three distinct primes.

It's also the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors? Let's see: numbers with 16 divisors can be of form p^15, p^7*q, p^3*q^3, p^3*q*r, p*q*r*s. The smallest for p^15 is 2^15=32768, too big. For p^7*q: 2^7*3=128*3=384. For p^3*q^3: 2^3*3^3=8*27=216. For p^3*q*r: 2^3*3*5=8*3*5=120. For p*q*r*s: 2*3*5*7=210. So indeed, 120 is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors.

Also, in geometry, 120 degrees is the interior angle of a regular hexagon? Actually, each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees. Also, in a triangle, if one angle is 120 degrees, it's obtuse.

In time, 120 minutes is 2 hours.

In sports, in basketball, the hoop is 120 inches? No, that's 10 feet, which is 120 inches? 10 feet = 120 inches, yes.

But I think the mathematical properties are more relevant.

So I'll list: factorial (5!), triangular number, tetrahedral number, highly composite number, smallest with 16 divisors, etc.

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

This is a quadratic equation. I can factor it or use quadratic formula.

Factoring: I need two numbers that multiply to -18 and add to -7. So factors of -18: pairs like (1,-18), (2,-9), (3,-6), and negatives. 2 and -9: 2 + (-9) = -7, and 2*(-9) = -18. So yes, (x+2)(x-9)=0? Check: (x+2)(x-9)= x^2 -9x +2x -18 = x^2 -7x -18. Correct.

So solutions: x+2=0 => x=-2, and x-9=0 => x=9.

Alternatively, quadratic formula: x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)]/2 = [7 ± sqrt(121)]/2 = [7 ± 11]/2. So x = (7+11)/2=18/2=9, or x=(7-11)/2=-4/2=-2.

So answers: x = -2 or x = 9.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

First, a full day is 24 hours.

One round trip means going from city A to city B and back to city A. So distance for one round trip is 200 km + 200 km = 400 km.

Speed is 60 km/h, so time for one round trip is distance/speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 400/60 = 40/6 = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.666... hours.

Now, number of round trips in 24 hours: 24 hours divided by time per round trip.

So 24 / (20/3) = 24 * 3/20 = 72/20 = 3.6.

But since it can't make a fraction of a round trip, we need to see how many full round trips it can complete. So it can make 3 full round trips, and then have some time left.

Let's calculate exactly: time for 3 round trips: 3 * 20/3 = 20 hours. Then time left: 24 - 20 = 4 hours. In 4 hours, it can travel 4 * 60 = 240 km. But for a round trip, it needs 400 km, so it can't complete another round trip. So only 3 full round trips.

But wait, the question says "how many round trips can it make", implying complete round trips. So answer should be 3.

But let's confirm: if it starts at city A, after one round trip it's back at A, after two back at A, after three back at A. Then in the remaining 4 hours, it can go from A to B (200 km) in 200/60 ≈ 3.333 hours, so it can reach B, but then it needs to return to A to complete the round trip, which would take another 200/60 ≈ 3.333 hours, but only 4 - 3.333 = 0.667 hours left, not enough. So it can't complete the fourth round trip. So indeed, only 3.

But sometimes people might think about one-way trips. But the question says "round trips", so from A to B and back to A.

So answer: 3 round trips.

Now, I need to provide steps for each.

For Q1, I'll list properties.

For Q2, show factoring or quadratic formula.

For Q3, calculate time per round trip and divide.

I think I'm sure about all.

### Q1: Significance and Properties of 120

**Answer:**  
120 is a notable number with several interesting mathematical properties:

1. **Factorial**: \(5! = 120\) (product of the first five positive integers).
2. **Highly Composite Number**: It has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120), more than any smaller number.
3. **Smallest with 16 Divisors**: It is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors, due to its prime factorization \(2^3 \times 3 \times 5\).
4. **Triangular Number**: \(120 = \frac{15 \times 16}{2}\), the sum of the first 15 integers.
5. **Tetrahedral Number**: \(120 = \frac{8 \times 9 \times 10}{6}\), representing a pyramid with a triangular base.
6. **Geometric Relevance**: Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is \(120^\circ\).
7. **Time Conversion**: 120 minutes equals 2 hours.

### Q2: Solve \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\)

**Answer:**  
The solutions are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 9\).

**Steps:**  
1. **Factor the quadratic**: Find two numbers that multiply to \(-18\) and add to \(-7\). These are \(2\) and \(-9\).  
   \[
   x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x + 2)(x - 9) = 0
   \]
2. **Set each factor to zero**:  
   \[
   x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
   \]
   \[
   x - 9 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 9
   \]
3. **Verify with quadratic formula** (optional):  
   \[
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]
   This gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -2\), confirming the factorization.

### Q3: Round Trips in a Full Day

**Answer:**  
The train can make **3 full round trips** in 24 hours.

**Steps:**  
1. **Distance per round trip**:  
   One round trip covers \(200 \, \text{km} + 200 \, \text{km} = 400 \, \text{km}\).
2. **Time per round trip**:  
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{400 \, \text{km}}{60 \, \text{km/h}} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours} \approx 6.667 \, \text{hours}
   \]
3. **Number of round trips in 24 hours**:  
   \[
   \frac{24 \, \text{hours}}{20/3 \, \text{hours}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
   \]
   Since only complete round trips count, the train can finish **3 full round trips**.
4. **Check remaining time**:  
   Time for 3 round trips: \(3 \times \frac{20}{3} = 20 \, \text{hours}\).  
   Remaining time: \(24 - 20 = 4 \, \text{hours}\).  
   In 4 hours, the train travels \(4 \times 60 = 240 \, \text{km}\), which is insufficient for another 400 km round trip. Thus, no fourth round trip is completed. [end of text]
