### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Significance and Interesting Properties of 120:**

1. **Factorial Number:**
   - 120 is the factorial of 5 (5!). This means 120 is the product of all positive integers up to 5: \( 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \).

2. **Triangular Number:**
   - 120 is a triangular number. A triangular number is a number that can be arranged in a triangular grid. The 15th triangular number is 120.

3. **Harshad Number:**
   - 120 is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3). 120 is divisible by 3.

4. **Highly Composite Number:**
   - 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller number. Its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

5. **In Binary and Hexadecimal:**
   - In binary, 120 is represented as 1111000.
   - In hexadecimal, it is represented as 78.

6. **In Geometry:**
   - 120 is the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon (120 degrees per angle).

### Q2: Solve the equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
   \]

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
   \]

4. **Calculate the roots:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
   \]

5. **Find the two solutions:**
   \[
   x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

6. **Final solution:**
   \[
   x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Calculate the time for one trip:**
   - Distance between the cities = 200 km
   - Speed = 60 km/h
   - Time for one trip (one way) = \( \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the time for a round trip:**
   - Time for round trip = \( 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Calculate the number of round trips in a day:**
   - Total hours in a day = 24 hours
   - Number of round trips = \( \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{6.67 \text{ hours/trip}} \approx 3.6 \)

4. **Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, round down to the nearest whole number:**
   - Number of round trips = 3

**Final Answer:**
The train can make **3 round trips** between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
