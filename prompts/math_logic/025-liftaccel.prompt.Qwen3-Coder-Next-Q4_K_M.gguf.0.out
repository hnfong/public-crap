We are given:

- Building has 40 floors.
- Each floor is 5 meters tall → total height = 40 × 5 = **200 meters**.
- Lift acceleration/deceleration = **1 m/s²**.
- Maximum speed = **5 m/s**.

We assume:
- Lift starts from rest at ground floor (floor 1), and stops at destination floor (velocity = 0).
- Motion profile: accelerate at 1 m/s² until reaching max speed (5 m/s), possibly cruise at constant speed, then decelerate at 1 m/s² to stop.

Let’s first analyze the motion profile of the lift.

---

### **Motion Profile Analysis**

Given:
- Acceleration $ a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 $
- Max speed $ v_{\max} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $

Time to reach max speed from rest:
$$
t_{\text{acc}} = \frac{v_{\max}}{a} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \, \text{s}
$$

Distance covered during acceleration:
$$
d_{\text{acc}} = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{acc}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 25 = 12.5 \, \text{m}
$$

Similarly, deceleration from $ v_{\max} $ to 0 takes same time and distance:
- $ t_{\text{dec}} = 5 \, \text{s} $
- $ d_{\text{dec}} = 12.5 \, \text{m} $

So, minimum distance needed to accelerate then decelerate (no cruising) = $ 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 \, \text{m} $

If the distance to travel is **≥ 25 m**, the lift will reach max speed and possibly cruise.

If distance < 25 m, the lift cannot reach max speed — it will accelerate partway, then immediately decelerate (triangular velocity profile).

Let’s define:
- For distance $ d $:
  - If $ d \le 25 $: no cruising; motion is symmetric accelerate-decelerate with peak speed $ v_{\text{peak}} < v_{\max} $
  - If $ d > 25 $: accelerate to $ v_{\max} $, cruise, then decelerate.

Let’s derive general formulas.

---

#### **Case 1: $ d \le 25 $ m (no cruising)**

Let $ t $ be total time. Since acceleration and deceleration are symmetric, time up to peak speed = $ t/2 $, and peak speed $ v_p = a \cdot (t/2) = (t/2) $ (since $ a = 1 $).

Distance:
$$
d = \frac{1}{2} a (t/2)^2 + \frac{1}{2} a (t/2)^2 = a \cdot \frac{t^2}{8} = \frac{t^2}{8}
\Rightarrow t = \sqrt{8d}
$$

Check: for $ d = 25 $, $ t = \sqrt{200} \approx 14.142 $ s  
But earlier, for full accelerate-decelerate to 5 m/s: $ t = 10 $ s, $ d = 25 $ m. Contradiction! Wait — mistake.

Let’s recalculate.

If accelerate for $ t_1 $, then decelerate for $ t_2 $, with $ a = 1 $, $ -a $.

Assume start and end at rest: $ v_{\text{peak}} = a t_1 = a t_2 \Rightarrow t_1 = t_2 = t/2 $

Distance:
$$
d = \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 + \left(v_{\text{peak}} t_2 - \frac{1}{2} a t_2^2\right)
= \frac{1}{2} a t_1^2 + \left(a t_1 \cdot t_2 - \frac{1}{2} a t_2^2\right)
$$

But $ t_1 = t_2 = t/2 $, so:
$$
d = \frac{1}{2} a (t/2)^2 + \left(a (t/2) (t/2) - \frac{1}{2} a (t/2)^2\right)
= \frac{1}{2} a \frac{t^2}{4} + \left(a \frac{t^2}{4} - \frac{1}{2} a \frac{t^2}{4}\right)
= \frac{a t^2}{8} + \left(\frac{a t^2}{4} - \frac{a t^2}{8}\right)
= \frac{a t^2}{8} + \frac{a t^2}{8} = \frac{a t^2}{4}
$$

Since $ a = 1 $, $ d = t^2 / 4 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{4d} = 2\sqrt{d} $

Check: for $ d = 25 $, $ t = 2 \cdot 5 = 10 $ s ✅ matches earlier.

Peak speed: $ v_p = a t_1 = 1 \cdot (t/2) = \sqrt{d} $

So for $ d = 25 $, $ v_p = 5 $ m/s — correct.

Thus:

- If $ d \le 25 $: $ t = 2\sqrt{d} $, $ v_{\text{peak}} = \sqrt{d} \le 5 $
- If $ d > 25 $: accelerate to 5 m/s (12.5 m), cruise at 5 m/s for distance $ d - 25 $, then decelerate (12.5 m)

Time:
- $ t_{\text{acc}} = 5 $ s
- $ t_{\text{dec}} = 5 $ s
- $ t_{\text{cruise}} = \frac{d - 25}{5} $
- Total: $ t = 10 + \frac{d - 25}{5} = \frac{d}{5} + 5 $

Check: for $ d = 25 $, $ t = 25/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 $ s ✅ matches.

So summary:

$$
t(d) =
\begin{cases}
2\sqrt{d}, & d \le 25 \\
\frac{d}{5} + 5, & d > 25
\end{cases}
$$

Now compute for various distances.

### **Question 1: Ground floor (1/F) to top floor (40/F)**

Height: $ d = 40 \times 5 = 200 $ m

Since $ 200 > 25 $, use second case:

$$
t = \frac{200}{5} + 5 = 40 + 5 = \boxed{45} \text{ seconds}
$$

✅ Answer 1: **45 s**

### **Question 2: Two people: 10/F and 30/F**

Assumptions:
- Lift starts at ground (1/F), picks up both.
- Goes to 10/F first? Or does it go to 30/F first? Usually, elevators stop in order — but question doesn’t specify. Since both get on at ground, and no other info, we assume **the lift stops at 10/F first**, then continues to 30/F.

But wait — does the lift stop at 10/F, let first person out, then continue? Yes.

So total motion:
1. Ground (0 m) → 10/F: height = 9 floors × 5 m = **45 m**  
   (Note: floor 1 is ground → floor 10 is 9 intervals up: 9 × 5 = 45 m)
2. Then 10/F → 30/F: 20 floors up = 20 × 5 = **100 m**

But careful: after stopping at 10/F, the lift starts from rest again (assumed), so each leg is independent.

Let’s compute time for each leg.

#### Leg 1: 0 → 45 m

$ d = 45 > 25 $, so:
$$
t_1 = \frac{45}{5} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \, \text{s}
$$

#### Leg 2: 45 m → 145 m (i.e., 100 m up)

$ d = 100 > 25 $, so:
$$
t_2 = \frac{100}{5} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \, \text{s}
$$

Total time = $ 14 + 25 = \boxed{39} $ seconds.

But wait — is stopping at 10/F required? Could the lift go directly to 30/F and drop off both? But question says: *first person goes to 10/F and second to 30/F* — implies both need to be delivered, so lift must stop at 10/F.

Unless the lift can skip stopping (e.g., just pass floor 10 without stopping), but that wouldn’t deliver person 1.

So yes, must stop at 10/F.

But does stopping add extra time? In our model, stopping means decelerating to 0 and re-accelerating — which we already accounted for by treating each leg separately (starting from rest each time). So no extra time.

✅ Answer 2: **39 seconds**

Wait — double-check floor counting.

- Floor 1 = ground (0 m)
- Floor 2 = 5 m above floor 1
- So floor $ n $ is at height $ (n-1) \times 5 $ m.

Thus:
- Floor 10: $ (10-1) \times 5 = 45 $ m ✅
- Floor 3
