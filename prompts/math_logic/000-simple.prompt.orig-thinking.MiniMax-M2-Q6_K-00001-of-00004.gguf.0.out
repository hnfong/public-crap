I need to answer these math questions. If I'm not sure, I should say so, but I think I can handle most of them. Let's go through them one by one.

Q1: 1+1=?

That's straightforward. 1 plus 1 is 2. So, answer should be 2.

Q2: 6*7=?

6 times 7 is 42. I know that from the multiplication table.

Q3: 83*59=?

This one might need some calculation. Let me compute it step by step.

First, 80 times 59. 80*60 = 4800, but since it's 59, which is 60 minus 1, so 80*59 = 80*60 - 80*1 = 4800 - 80 = 4720.

Then, 3 times 59 is 177.

Now, add them together: 4720 + 177.

4720 + 100 = 4820, plus 77 is 4820 + 77 = 4897.

Let me do it properly: 4720 + 177.

0 + 7 = 7

2 + 7 = 9

7 + 1 = 8

4 + 0 = 4, but 4720 has 4 in thousands, so 4720 + 177.

Better to align:

  4720

+  177

------

Start from right: 0 + 7 = 7

2 + 7 = 9

7 + 1 = 8

4 + 0 = 4, so 4897.

Yes, 83*59 = 4897.

I can also do 83*60 - 83*1 = 4980 - 83 = 4897. Same thing.

So, 4897.

Q4: 349*683=?

This is bigger. I need to multiply these two numbers.

Let me break it down.

First, 349 * 600 = 349 * 6 * 100 = (350*6 - 1*6)*100 = (2100 - 6)*100 = 2094*100 = 209,400.

349 * 6 = 2094, then *100 = 209,400.

Then, 349 * 80 = 349 * 8 * 10 = (350*8 - 1*8)*10 = (2800 - 8)*10 = 2792*10 = 27,920.

349 * 8 = 2792, yes, then *10 = 27,920.

Then, 349 * 3 = 1047.

Now, add them all: 209,400 + 27,920 + 1047.

First, 209,400 + 27,920.

209,400 + 27,000 = 236,400

236,400 + 920 = 237,320

Now, add 1047: 237,320 + 1047.

237,320 + 1000 = 238,320

238,320 + 47 = 238,367

So, 349 * 683 = 238,367.

I should double-check.

I can do it as (350 - 1) * 683 = 350*683 - 1*683.

350*683: 350*600=210,000; 350*80=28,000; 350*3=1,050; total 210,000 + 28,000 = 238,000 + 1,050 = 239,050.

Then minus 683: 239,050 - 683 = 238,367.

Same as before. Good.

Q5: 6043*7489=?

This is even bigger. I might need a calculator, but since this is a text, I'll do it manually.

Let me compute 6043 * 7489.

First, I can do 6043 * 7000 = 6043 * 7 * 1000 = (6000*7 + 43*7)*1000 = (42,000 + 301)*1000 = 42,301 * 1000 = 42,301,000.

6043 * 7 = 42,301, yes, then *1000 = 42,301,000.

Then, 6043 * 400 = 6043 * 4 * 100 = (6000*4 + 43*4)*100 = (24,000 + 172)*100 = 24,172 * 100 = 2,417,200.

6043 * 4 = 24,172, yes.

Then, 6043 * 80 = 6043 * 8 * 10 = (6000*8 + 43*8)*10 = (48,000 + 344)*10 = 48,344 * 10 = 483,440.

6043 * 8 = 48,344, yes.

Then, 6043 * 9 = 54,387.

Now, add them all: 42,301,000 + 2,417,200 + 483,440 + 54,387.

First, add 42,301,000 and 2,417,200.

42,301,000 + 2,417,200 = 44,718,200.

Then, add 483,440: 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640.

44,718,200 + 483,440.

200 + 440 = 640

718,200 + 483,440? Better to align:

  44,718,200

+    483,440

------------

Start from right: 0 + 0 = 0

0 + 4 = 4

2 + 4 = 6

8 + 3 = 11, write 1, carry 1

1 + 8 + 4 = 13, plus carry 1 = 14, write 4, carry 1? Let's write it properly.

Actually, 44,718,200 has digits: millions, etc.

44,718,200

+  483,440

So, align by place:

  44,718,200

+    483,440

------------

From right:

0 + 0 = 0

0 + 4 = 4

2 + 4 = 6

8 + 3 = 11, write 1, carry 1

1 + 8 + 4 = 13, plus carry 1 = 14, write 4, carry 1? The digits:

Positions: hundred thousands, ten thousands, etc.

44,718,200 is 44 million, 718 thousand, 200.

483,440 is 483 thousand, 440.

So, adding:

Millions: 44

Thousands: 718 + 483 = 1201, so 1,201 thousand, which is 1 million and 201 thousand.

Better:

44,718,200

+   483,440

= 44,718,200 + 483,440 = 45,201,640

Because 718,200 + 483,440 = 1,201,640, then 44,000,000 + 1,201,640 = 45,201,640.

44,718,200 + 483,440:

200 + 440 = 640

718,000 + 483,000 = 1,201,000, but 718,200 is 718,000 + 200, so 718,000 + 483,000 = 1,201,000, plus 200 + 440 = 640, so 1,201,640.

Then
