 This statement is a mnemonic or memory aid for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It suggests that a simple way to remember the conversion is by associating the relationship between the change in temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

To understand this better, let's first review the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit:

F = C × 9/5 + 32

Where:
F = temperature in Fahrenheit
C = temperature in Celsius

Now, let's analyze the mnemonic:

"The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted."

This means that for every 12°C increase in temperature, the last two digits of the Fahrenheit equivalent are inverted.

Examples:

1. 0°C to 32°F:
   The first 12°C increase is from 0°C to 12°C, and the Fahrenheit equivalent is 54°F (12 × 9/5 + 32). The last two digits, 54, are not inverted.

2. 10°C to 50°F:
   The second 12°C increase is from 0°C to 24°C, and the Fahrenheit equivalent is 75°F (24 × 9/5 + 32). The last two digits, 75, are inverted from the previous example (54).

3. 20°C to 68°F:
   The third 12°C increase is from 12°C to 24°C, and the Fahrenheit equivalent is 68°F (24 × 9/5 + 32). The last two digits, 68, are inverted from the previous example (75).

This mnemonic can help you remember the conversion pattern, but it's important to note that it won't always result in accurate conversions since it's based on a specific interval. To convert temperatures accurately, you should still use the formula provided earlier. [end of text]
