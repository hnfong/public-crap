**Q5: 6043*7489=?**
* **Answer:** 45,301,267

**Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.**
* **Answer:** Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15, then divide by 3: **x = 5**

**Q7: What is 25% of 80?**
* **Answer:** 0.25 * 80 = **20**

**Q8: Change from a $15 purchase with two $20 bills and an additional $5 bill.**
* **Calculation:** 2*$20 + $5 = $45, minus $15 (cost) = **$30 (change)**
* **Answer:** $30

**Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.**
* **Answer:** Since all sides are equal, 5 units * 4 sides = **20 units**

**Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?**
* **Answer:** This includes Katherine, so 2 brothers + 1 sister + Katherine = **4 children**

**Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1**
* **Calculation:** Follow order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): 12 รท 4 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6, finally 6 - 1 = **5**
* **Answer:** 5

**Q12: How many slices of birthday cake do 5 guests need?**
* **Answer:** This question lacks context on cake size or slices per guest. Assuming 1 slice per guest, **5 slices**. (Note: This answer assumes a specific interpretation due to the question's ambiguity.)

**Q13: Sale price of a $25 shirt with 20% off.**
* **Calculation:** 20% of $25 = 0.20 * $25 = $5, then $25 - $5 = **$20**
* **Answer:** $20

**Q14: Minutes from 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM.**
* **Calculation:** From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 2 hours 15 minutes, then add the 30 minutes to 6:00 PM, totaling **2 hours 45 minutes** or **165 minutes**.
* **Answer:** 165 minutes

**Q15: Taxis needed for 22 people if each taxi can carry 4 passengers.**
* **Calculation:** Divide total people by passengers per taxi: 22 / 4 = 5.5, since you can't have half a taxi, round up to **6 taxis**.
* **Answer:** 6 taxis

**Q16: Measure of the third angle in a triangle with angles 31 degrees and 62 degrees.**
* **Calculation:** Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees: 180 - (31 + 62) = 180 - 93 = **87 degrees**
* **Answer:** 87 degrees [end of text]
