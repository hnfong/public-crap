Please answer ALL the following math questions. Show your steps. Do not stop until you have attempted to answer ALL the questions (even if it may be hard).

There is a 40 story building. Each floor is 5 meters tall.

The lift/elevator goes from the ground floor (1/F) to the top floor (40/F). Its acceleration/deceleration is 1m/s^2. Its maximum speed is 5m/s.

Questions:

1. How long does it take for a person to get from the ground floor to the top floor?

2. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 10/F and second person goes to 30/F. How long does it take?

3. Two people get on the same lift on the ground floor. First person goes to 40/F. Assuming the second person does not go to the same (40/F) floor, what is the minimum time it will take for the lift to get to 40/F if it has to stop at another floor between 1/F and 40/F?

Sure, let's break down each question:

1. **Time to reach the top floor (40/F):**

   The lift starts from rest, so we'll use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion: `s = ut + (1/2)at^2`, where `s` is the distance, `u` is the initial velocity (0 m/s), `a` is the acceleration (1 m/s²), and `t` is the time.

   The total distance to the top floor is 40 floors * 5 meters/floor = 200 meters.

   Rearranging the equation to solve for time (`t`):
   ```
   200 = 0 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t^2
   200 = (1/2) * t^2
   t^2 = 400
   t = 20 seconds
   ```

2. **Time for two people to reach different floors:**

   The lift will first go to 10/F (50 meters) and then to 30/F (150 meters). We'll use the same kinematic equation, but we'll need to consider the time it takes to decelerate and accelerate between floors.

   Let's assume the lift reaches its maximum speed (5 m/s) before it needs to decelerate. The time to reach 5 m/s is `t = v/a = 5/1 = 5 seconds`.

   - Time to reach 10/F:
     ```
     50 = 5 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t^2
     50 = 5t + 0.5t^2
     0.5t^2 + 5t - 50 = 0
     t ≈ 9.5 seconds
     ```
   - Time to reach 30/F after stopping at 10/F:
     ```
     100 = 5 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t^2
     100 = 5t + 0.5t^2
     0.5t^2 + 5t - 100 = 0
     t ≈ 18.9 seconds
     ```
   Total time = 5 (acceleration) + 9.5 (to 10/F) + 5 (deceleration) + 18.9 (to 30/F) = 38.4 seconds.

3. **Minimum time to reach 40/F with one stop:**

   To minimize the time, the lift should stop at the middle floor (20/F) to reduce the distance it needs to travel at full speed.

   - Time to reach 20/F:
     ```
     100 = 5 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t^2
     100 = 5t + 0.5t^2
     0.5t^2 + 5t - 100 = 0
     t ≈ 18.9 seconds
     ```
   - Time to reach 40/F after stopping at 20/F:
     ```
     100 = 5 * t + (1/2) * 1 * t^2
     100 = 5t + 0.5t^2
     0.5t^2 + 5t - 100 = 0
     t ≈ 18.9 seconds
     ```
   Total time = 5 (acceleration) + 18.9 (to 20/F) + 5 (deceleration) + 18.9 (to 40/F) = 48.7 seconds.
