The statement "The easiest way to remember Celsius to Fahrenheit: every 12°C, the digits are inverted" is a mnemonic device to help remember the approximate conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. Here's what it means and how to use it:

1. **Every 12°C**: This refers to specific Celsius temperatures that are multiples of 12, such as 0°C, 12°C, 24°C, 36°C, etc.

2. **Digits are inverted**: This means that you take the Celsius temperature, and if it's a multiple of 12, you can invert (reverse) its digits to get an approximate Fahrenheit temperature.

Here are some examples:

- **0°C**: Invert the digits to get 0°F. However, the actual conversion is 32°F. This is not a perfect match, but it's close.
- **12°C**: Invert the digits to get 21°F. The actual conversion is 53.6°F. This is not a close match, so this mnemonic may not be reliable for this temperature.
- **24°C**: Invert the digits to get 42°F. The actual conversion is 75.2°F. This is not a close match either.
- **36°C**: Invert the digits to get 63°F. The actual conversion is 96.8°F. Again, not a close match.

As you can see, this mnemonic is not very accurate for most temperatures. It might be more helpful to use the exact conversion formula:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Or to remember some key points:

- 0°C = 32°F
- 10°C ≈ 50°F
- 20°C ≈ 68°F
- 30°C ≈ 86°F
- 40°C ≈ 104°F

These key points can help you estimate other temperatures by interpolation. For example, if you want to estimate 25°C, you can see that it's halfway between 20°C (68°F) and 30°C (86°F), so you might estimate 25°C as approximately 77°F. The actual conversion is 77°F, so this estimation method works well in this case. [end of text]
