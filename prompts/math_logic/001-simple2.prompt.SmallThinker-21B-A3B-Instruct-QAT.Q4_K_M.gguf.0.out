### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

**Answer:**  
The number 120 has several interesting properties and historical significance:  
1. **Highly Composite Number**: It has more divisors (16) than any smaller number, making it highly composite.  
2. **Factorial**: 120 is equal to $5!$ (5 factorial), which is $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.  
3. **Triangular Number**: It is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers ($1 + 2 + \dots + 15 = 120$).  
4. **Harshad Number**: It is divisible by the sum of its digits ($1 + 2 + 0 = 3$; $120 \div 3 = 40$).  
5. **Religious Significance**: In some traditions, 120 is associated with the age of Moses (Deuteronomy 34:7) or the number of tribes in ancient Israel.  
6. **Mathematical Curiosities**: It is the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to 10.

### Q2: Solve the equation: $x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0$

**Answer:**  
**Step 1:** Identify coefficients:  
- $a = 1$, $b = -7$, $c = -18$.  

**Step 2:** Use the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
$$  

**Step 3:** Calculate solutions:  
- $x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9$  
- $x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$  

**Final Answer:**  
$$
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
$$

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

**Answer:**  
**Step 1:** Calculate time for one one-way trip:  
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \, \text{km}}{60 \, \text{km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \, \text{hours} \approx 3.333 \, \text{hours}
$$  

**Step 2:** Calculate time for a round trip (to and from):  
$$
\text{Round trip time} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours} \approx 6.666 \, \text{hours}
$$  

**Step 3:** Calculate number of round trips in 24 hours:  
$$
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{24 \, \text{hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \, \text{hours/trip}} = 24 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
$$  

**Final Answer:**  
The train can make **3.6 round trips** in a day. Since partial trips are not practical, the answer is **3 full round trips** (with 12 hours remaining).

**Note:** If the question expects a fractional answer (e.g., 3.6), that is acceptable. If only whole trips are allowed, the answer is **3**. [end of text]
