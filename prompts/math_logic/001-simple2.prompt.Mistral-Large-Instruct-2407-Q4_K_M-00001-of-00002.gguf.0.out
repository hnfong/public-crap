 Sure, let's go through each question step by step.

### Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

1. **Factorization**: 120 can be factored into prime numbers as \( 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \).
2. **Divisors**: It has a large number of divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
3. **Highly Composite Number**: 120 is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
4. **Abundant Number**: It is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 240) is greater than 120.
5. **Geometric Significance**: In geometry, 120 degrees is the measure of an interior angle of an equilateral triangle.
6. **Historical Significance**: In ancient cultures, 120 was often associated with time and cycles, such as the 120-year cycle in the Mayan calendar.

### Q2: Solve the equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).

1. Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121 \]

2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
\[ \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

3. Substitute into the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm 11}{2 \times 1} = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]
\[ x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. Calculate the time for one trip:
\[ \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \]

2. Calculate the time for a round trip:
\[ \text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours} \]

3. Calculate the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours):
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \]

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day.

So, the train can make 3 round trips between the two cities within a full day. [end of text]
