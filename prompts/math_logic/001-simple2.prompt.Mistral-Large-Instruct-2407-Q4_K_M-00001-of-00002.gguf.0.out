Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

[/INST] 1. **Significance and Properties of the Number 120:**

   - **Factorization:** \( 120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \)
   - **Divisors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120
   - **Sum of Divisors:** The sum of the divisors of 120 is 360.
   - **Abundant Number:** 120 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (360) is greater than 120.
   - **Highly Composite Number:** 120 has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
   - **Factorial:** \( 120 = 5! \) (5 factorial, which is \( 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \))
   - **Geometric Properties:** 120 degrees is the interior angle of an equilateral triangle.

2. **Solve the Equation: \( x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 \)**

   - **Step 1:** Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -18 \).
   - **Step 2:** Calculate the discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \):
     \[
     (-7)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
     \]
   - **Step 3:** Take the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{121} = 11
     \]
   - **Step 4:** Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2}
     \]
   - **Step 5:** Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -2
     \]
   - **Answer:** The solutions are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -2 \).

3. **Number of Round Trips a Train Can Make:**

   - **Step 1:** Calculate the time for one trip:
     \[
     \text{Time for one trip} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Step 2:** Calculate the time for a round trip:
     \[
     \text{Time for a round trip} = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Step 3:** Determine the number of round trips in a full day (24 hours):
     \[
     \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{\frac{20}{3} \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \times 3}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6
     \]
   - **Answer:** The train can make 3 full round trips within a full day.
