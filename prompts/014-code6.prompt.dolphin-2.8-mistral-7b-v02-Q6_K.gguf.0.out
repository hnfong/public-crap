Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The program will run indefinitely until an input is provided that makes `x` greater than or equal to `math.inf` (infinity). This will happen when the increment (`inc`) is a negative number and the input is less than the absolute value of the increment.

Here are two examples:
1. Input: 10, Output: "Done"
   Explanation: If the increment is negative (e.g., `inc = -10`), and the input is less than the absolute value of the increment (e.g., input = 10), then the `while` loop will continue until `x` is greater than or equal to `math.inf`, leading to the output "Done".

2. Input: -1000, Output: "Done"
   Explanation: If the increment is positive (e.g., `inc = 1000`), and the input is less than the increment (e.g., input = -1000), then the `while` loop will continue until `x` is greater than or equal to `math.inf`, leading to the output "Done".<|im_end|>
