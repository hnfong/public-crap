Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element in a sorted list. The binary search algorithm works by dividing the search space into two halves, and recursively searching each half until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.
Here's how to perform a binary search directly on the text file we discussed earlier:

1. Read the file line by line using `with open(file_path, 'r') as f:`.
2. Iterate over each line in the file, building a sorted list of strings containing all the names.
3. Find the smallest element in this list (the one that has the smallest lexicographical index). This is the target value to search for.
4. Loop through the sorted list and increment a counter `index`.
5. Repeat until we find the target value or reach the end of the file:
   - If we found it, return its position (the index) as the insertion point.
   - Otherwise, decrease the counter `index` by 1, and continue to the next line in the file.
6. After finding the target value, decrement `index`. This means that if we reach the end of the file and haven't found the target yet, we still have one more iteration left (to search for the insertion point).

Here's a Python function to perform binary search on a text file:

```python
def binary_search_file(filename, target):
    """Perform a binary search on a sorted file"""
    # Read the file line by line and sort it in lexicographical order.
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
        lines.sort()
    
    # Find the smallest element in the sorted list (the one that has the smallest index).
    target_index = 0
    min_index = len(lines) - 1
    while min_index >= 0:
        if lines[min_index] == target:
            break
        if lines[min_index] < target:
            target_index = min_index
            min_index -= 1
    
    # If we found the target, return its index position as an insertion point.
    if target_index < len(lines) and target == lines[target_index]:
        return target_index
    
    # Otherwise, decrease the counter and continue to search for the insertion point.
    return -1 if target_index == 0 else binary_search_file(filename, lines[target_index - 1])
```

This function first reads the file line by line and sorts it in lexicographical order. It then finds the smallest element in this sorted list (the one that has the smallest index). This is the target value to search for. The `binary_search_file` function returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left") depending on whether it found the target or not.

You can call this function with your text file path as argument and pass in any valid target value, such as `"John"` or `"Doe"`.
