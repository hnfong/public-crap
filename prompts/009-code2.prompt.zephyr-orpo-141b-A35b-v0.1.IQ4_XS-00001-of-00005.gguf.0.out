Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Performing a binary search on a text file directly can be challenging, as files are sequential access structures, and random access is not efficient. However, we can utilize the fact that the file is already sorted to make an efficient search.

The idea is to use the size of the file and the size of each line to calculate the position of the midpoint in the file, read that line, and then decide whether to search in the first half or the second half. This way, we can perform a binary search with O(log(n)) file operations.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the size of the file and each line
        file_size = os.stat(file_path).st_size
        line_size = 0
        for line in file:
            line_size = len(line)
            break

        # Perform binary search
        low = 0
        high = file_size // line_size - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # Calculate the byte position of the midpoint
            file.seek(mid * line_size)
            next_line = file.readline()

            if not next_line:
                # Reached end of file, no more lines to read
                break

            comparison = compare_line(next_line.strip(), target)
            if comparison == 0:
                return mid
            elif comparison < 0:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        # Not found, return the insertion point
        return low

def compare_line(line, target):
    return (line > target) - (line < target)
```

In this implementation, we first get the size of the file and the size of each line. Then, we perform a binary search using the `seek` method to jump to the midpoint of the file and read the line at that position. We compare the read line with the target and decide which half to search next. If the target is not found, we return the insertion point.

This approach assumes that all lines have the same length, which might not be the case in all text files. If lines have variable lengths, a more complex approach would be needed, possibly involving preprocessing the file to store line offsets.</s>
