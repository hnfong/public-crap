Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. x = 5
Q7: What is 25% of 80? Answer: 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. The final change she should give me is $5.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. Perimeter = 4*side = 4*5=20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Answer: 1 (Katherine's mother is not mentioned to have any other children).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Answer: It depends on the number of slices each person will eat, but generally, if everyone eats 2 slices each, then they would need 10 slices in total (5 people * 2 slices per person).
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? Answer: The discount is 20% of $25, which is 0.20*25 = $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? Answer: There are 1 hour and 45 minutes from 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM, and another 30 minutes from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM. So there are 60 + 45 + 30 = 135 minutes left.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? Answer: Since each taxi can carry 4 passengers, you would need to divide the total number of people by the capacity of each taxi. 22 รท 4 = 5.5, so you would need 6 taxis (since you cannot have half a taxi).
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? Answer: The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So, to find the third angle, subtract the sum of the other two angles from 180 degrees: 180 - (31 + 62) = 67 degrees.
