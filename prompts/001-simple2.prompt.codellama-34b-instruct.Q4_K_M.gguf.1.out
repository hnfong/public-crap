Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 has interesting properties such as being a factorial and a sum of factorials. It is also known to be a Harshad number, a palindromic prime, a Pell number, and other interesting numbers. It is the number of spokes in a wheel with 720 degrees.

Q2: x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 3)(x + 6) = 0, therefore x = 3 or x = -6.

Q3: The train travels for two hours to reach the destination and returns back at the same speed. Therefore it makes one round trip in a day.
