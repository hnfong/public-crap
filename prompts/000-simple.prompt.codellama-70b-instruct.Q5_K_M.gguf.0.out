 Sure! Here are the answers to the given questions:

Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4907
Q4: 349*683=234197
Q5: 6043*7489=457196977
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. x=(22-7)/3 = 8 (since there are no fractions in the original equation, the answer is also an integer)
Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% of 80 is 20 (since 25% means that you multiply the number by 1/4 and simplify the fraction.)
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The shopkeeper gives you back one 15-dollar bill and two 5-dollar bills.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. Perimeter = (4 x 5) = 20 units
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Her mother has three children, including Katherine herself.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 Ã· 4 - 1 (Note that division and subtraction have higher precedence than addition, so they should be evaluated first). Therefore, ((3+12)Ã·4)-1 = 15Ã·4-1 = 3.75-1 = 2.75
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? If each guest gets one slice, then the answer is 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The sale price would be 80% of $25 = $20 (since 20% is being taken off).
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? There are 90 minutes between 3:45 PM and 6:30 PM.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? The answer is (22/4) = 5.5, which means that 5 taxis are required to carry all the passengers, with 2 passengers sharing a taxi in the last one.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of the three angles in any triangle must be 180Â°, so (31+62)+x = 180Â°. Therefore, x = 87Â°.
