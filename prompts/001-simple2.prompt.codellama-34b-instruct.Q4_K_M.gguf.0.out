Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 is special because it is the result of multiplying all numbers from 1 to 5. It has several interesting properties which make it an important number in mathematics and other fields such as philosophy, numerology, etc. For example, it is a triangle number, hexagonal number, pentagonal number, and a cuban number (a number that can be expressed in the form of $a^3 + b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers).

Q2: The solutions to this equation are x=9 and x=-18.

Q3: There are 6 round trips.
