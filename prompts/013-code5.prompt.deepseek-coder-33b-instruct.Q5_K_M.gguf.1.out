### Instruction:

What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)


### Response:

The output will be "Infinity". The while loop is set to run indefinitely as the condition `x < math.inf` is always true because `math.inf` represents positive infinity, which is greater than any finite number including 1.0. Therefore, when x gets close to infinity, it keeps getting multiplied by 1.001 and never reaches a point where it stops being less than infinity.
