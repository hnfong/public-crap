If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself can be considered both "consistent" and "tautological" to some extent, depending on the context and how the self-proof is interpreted. Let's clarify these terms:

1. **Consistent**: A theory is consistent if it does not lead to a contradiction, i.e., there is no statement and its negation that can both be derived within the theory. A consistent theory that proves itself is demonstrating that it does not contain contradictory statements.

2. **Tautological**: This term typically refers to a logical statement that is true by virtue of its structure alone, without regard to the specific truth values of its components. In the context of a theory, if it can be shown that the theory is true purely based on its logical structure, we might say it is tautological or logically equivalent to a tautology.

Examples of such theories include:

1. **Peano Axioms for Arithmetic**: The Peano Axioms, when stated in second-order logic, are consistent and can be shown to be consistent within a stronger logical system. While they don't strictly prove themselves, Gödel's Completeness Theorem indicates that a consistent set of axioms can be formalized in a way that proves all its theorems, including its own consistency (assuming the stronger system is consistent).

2. **Hilbert's System**: David Hilbert's system for propositional calculus is an example of a logical framework that can prove its own consistency. By constructing a proof of consistency within the system, we can show that it does not lead to contradictions.

3. **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that, in any sufficiently powerful formal system (like Peano arithmetic), there will be statements that cannot be proven or disproven within the system. However, it is possible to construct a sentence that effectively says, "I am unprovable," which would be a self-referential tautology if it could be proven within the system.

It is important to note that self-proof of consistency can be problematic due to Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, which states that no consistent, sufficiently powerful system can prove its own consistency without being inconsistent. This means that while a theory may be consistent, it cannot prove its consistency within itself.
