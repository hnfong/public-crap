Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.
 [/INST]  Sure! The program will output "Done" when `x` exceeds `math.inf`. This can happen when the input `inc` is a large positive number. Here are two examples:

1. Input: 1e300
In this case, `inc` is 1e300, which is a large positive number. When added to `x`, it will quickly exceed `math.inf`, and the program will output "Done".
2. Input: 1e600
Similarly, if the input is 1e600, `inc` will be 1e600, which is also a large positive number. When added to `x`, it will exceed `math.inf`, and the program will output "Done".

Note that the program will not output "Done" for any finite input, as `x` will never reach `math.inf` in that case.
