 [/INST]  Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, was born in 259 BC to King Zhao of Qin and Queen Xia. He had several family members, including his parents, wives, concubines, and children.

King Zhao of Qin was a powerful ruler who united various tribes and expanded the Qin state. He was known for his military prowess and strategic thinking. Queen Xia was from the royal family of the State of Chu and was known for her beauty and intelligence.

Qin Shi Huang had several wives and concubines throughout his life, but his main wife was Empress Wang Zhi, who was also known as Empress Dowager Bo. She was a powerful figure in her own right and played a significant role in Qin Shi Huang's rise to power.

As for his childhood, it is said that Qin Shi Huang had a difficult and lonely upbringing. His father was often away at war, and he was raised by his mother and tutors. He was known to be intelligent and ambitious from an early age and was appointed as the crown prince at the age of 13.

It is unclear whether Qin Shi Huang's childhood was happy or not, but it is known that he was under a lot of pressure to succeed his father and unite China. He was tutored by the famous philosopher Confucius, who instilled in him a sense of duty and morality.

Overall, Qin Shi Huang's family life and upbringing played a significant role in shaping his character and ambitions, which ultimately led to his success in unifying China and becoming its first emperor.
