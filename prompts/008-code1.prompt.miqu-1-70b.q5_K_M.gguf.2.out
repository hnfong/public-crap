Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Here is an implementation of bubble sort in Python:
```
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Here is an implementation of merge sort in Python:
```
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr)//2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)
        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in sorted order. Merge sort is a stable sort, which means that equal elements maintain their relative order during sorting.

Comparing bubble sort and merge sort:

* Bubble sort has a worst case time complexity of O(n^2), while merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n).
* Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it only requires a constant amount of additional space. Merge sort, on the other hand, is not an in-place algorithm and it requires O(n) additional space for merging the subarrays.
* Merge sort is more efficient than bubble sort for large data sets, but the constant factors involved in merge sort's operations make it slower than bubble sort for small arrays.
* Bubble sort is easier to understand and implement than merge sort.
* Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, while bubble sort can be made stable by making a simple modification, but still not as efficient as merge sort in terms of time complexity.
