Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The given Python code is supposed to perform an in-place version of quick sort on a list `a`. The function works by taking the first element as a pivot and then partitioning the rest of the array into two lists, one with elements less than or equal to the pivot, and another with elements greater than the pivot.

Here are some issues I see:
- It's not actually sorting in place because it creates new lists `l` and `r`, which may cause memory inefficiencies for large arrays. 
- The function does not return anything that would indicate an error occurred (e.g., if the input is empty or contains non-numeric elements).
- There's no base case to stop recursion, which could lead to a stack overflow with very long lists.

Here is how I might re-implement this in Rust:

```rust
fn quick_sort(mut arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    match arr.len() {
        0 => vec![],
        _ => {
            let pivot = &arr[0];
            let (mut lt, mut gt): (Vec<&mut i32>, Vec<&mut i32>) = ([], []);
            
            for val in &mut arr.iter_mut().skip(1) { 
                if *val <= *pivot {
                    lt.push(val);
                } else {
                    gt.push(val);
                }
            }
            
            let mut sorted = quick_sort(lt.to_vec());
            sorted.push(*pivot);
            sorted.extend(quick_sort(gt.to_vec()));
            
            return sorted;
        },
    };
}
```
This Rust function does an in-place version of the quicksort algorithm. It uses two mutable vectors to hold values less than or equal to the pivot and greater than the pivot, respectively. The base case is handled by returning an empty vector when given an input array of size 0. After partitioning around a pivot value, it recursively sorts each half before combining them back together with the pivot in between.

Please note that the provided Rust code still isn't truly "in-place" because `lt` and `gt` vectors are created to store less than or greater than elements respectively which might not be efficient for large lists. A true in-place quick sort would require more complex rearrangement of elements within array itself. This is a simplified version that should illustrate the basic idea.
