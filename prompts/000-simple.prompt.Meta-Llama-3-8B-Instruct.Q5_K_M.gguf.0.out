I'll do my best to answer each question accurately. Here are the answers:

Q1: 1+1=? Answer: 2

Q2: 6*7=? Answer: 42

Q3: 83*59=? Answer: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 4917.

Q4: 349*683=? Answer: I am not sure, but I think the answer is 238,111.

Q5: 60,043*7,489=? Answer: I am not sure, but I think the answer is a very large number that is difficult to calculate manually.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. Answer: Subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.

Q7: What is 25% of 80? Answer: 25% is the same as 1/4, so 1/4 of 80 is 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? Answer: The shopkeeper should give you $30 in total, so the change would be $15.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. Answer: Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter is 4 times the side length, which is 4 x 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Answer: Since Katherine is one of the children, the mother has 3 children in total (2 brothers and 1 sister).

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. Answer: First, divide 12 by 4 to get 3, then add 3 to get 6, and finally subtract 1 to get 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Answer: Since there are 5 guests, they will likely need 5 slices of cake.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? Answer: 20% of $25 is $5, so the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? Answer: First, subtract the current time from the target time: 6:30 - 3:45 = 1 hour 45 minutes. Then, convert the hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1 hour x 60 = 60 minutes, and add the remaining 45 minutes to get a total of 105 minutes.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? Answer: Divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi to get 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you can't take a fraction of a taxi, you would need 6 taxis to accommodate 22 people.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? Answer: Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, subtract the known angles from 180 to get 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
