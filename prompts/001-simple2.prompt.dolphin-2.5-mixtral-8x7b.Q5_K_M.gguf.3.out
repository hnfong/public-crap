 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is the smallest abundant number (a positive integer that is less than its proper divisors' sum). 

2. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as a product of two different numbers in three distinct ways: 3 * 4 * 5, 2 * 60, and 120 itself.

3. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.

4. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct cubes in six different ways: 5^3 + (-3)^3 = 120 and so on.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-18))] / (2 * 1)

x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2

x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

There are two possible solutions: x = (7 + 11) / 2 and x = (7 - 11) / 2. So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between the two cities within a full day, we first need to find out how long it takes for the train to travel between the cities at 60 km/h.

Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance between the two cities is 200 km and the speed of the train is 60 km/h:

Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours

Assuming a full day consists of 24 hours, we can now determine how many round trips the train can make within that time:

Number of round trips = (24 hours) / (3.33 hours per trip)

Number of round trips ≈ 7.19

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a trip, it can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
