### Instruction:

Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

No, there are no inputs that can make this program reach "Done". The reason is because it's a floating-point comparison and incrementing by `inc` over and over again will never be equal to or greater than `math.inf` (which is positive infinity). 

Therefore, the condition in the while loop will always be True, leading to an infinite loop. Hence, "Done" will never be printed as output. 

In Python, `float('inf')` represents positive infinity and `float('-inf')` represents negative infinity. If you were to use these values directly (like `while x < float('inf')`), the result would be the same - an infinite loop.
