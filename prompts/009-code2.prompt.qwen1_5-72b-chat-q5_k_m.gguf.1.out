Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted list. However, applying it to a file directly can be tricky since we can't keep the entire contents of a large file in memory. We can overcome this by reading the file line by line while maintaining the lexicographical order.

The key idea is that during each step of binary search, we read only the necessary middle lines from the file and compare them with the target value. If the middle line is less than the target, we know the target should be in the upper half of the remaining part of the file (lines with higher lexicographical order). Similarly, if the middle line is greater or equal to the target, it should be in the lower half.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    lower = 0
    upper = -1

    # Open the file for reading
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        while True:
            # Check if we have reached the end of the file
            if upper == -1:
                line = f.readline()
                if not line:
                    return lower  # Target is not in the file, return the insertion point

                upper += 1  # Increment the count of lines read so far

            mid = (lower + upper) // 2

            # Jump directly to the middle line
            f.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                if not f.readline():
                    break

            middle_line = f.readline().strip()

            # Compare the middle line with the target
            if middle_line == target:
                return mid
            elif middle_line < target:
                lower = mid + 1
            else:
                upper = mid - 1

    assert False, "This point should not be reached"
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize `lower` and `upper` as the boundaries of our search space. Initially, `upper` is set to `-1`, which means we haven't read any lines yet.
- In each iteration, we calculate the middle index `mid`.
- We seek back to the beginning of the file and skip lines until we reach the middle line. If there are no more lines, it means the target is not in the file and we return the insertion point (`lower`).
- After reading the middle line, we compare it with the target: if they match, we return the index; if the middle line is less than the target, we update `lower` to search in the upper half; otherwise, we update `upper` to search in the lower half.
- The loop continues until we find the target or determine that it's not in the file.

Note: This implementation assumes the file is sorted lexicographically and each line contains a single name. It doesn't handle cases where multiple names may appear on the same line, nor does it account for names with different lengths. Also, since files cannot be randomly accessed like arrays, there might be some performance overhead due to seeking and reading lines. However, in terms of the number of operations, it's still O(log(n)).
