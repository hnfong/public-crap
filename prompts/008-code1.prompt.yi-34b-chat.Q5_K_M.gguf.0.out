Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Certainly! Below are implementations of bubble sort and merge sort in Python, followed by a discussion of the two algorithms and a comparison.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The "bubbling" effect happens because the largest (or smallest) element "bubbles" to the top of the list.

```python
def bubble_sort(array):
    n = len(array)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(n - 1 - i):
            if array[j] > array[j + 1]:
                array[j], array[j + 1] = array[j + 1], array[j]
    return array

# Example usage:
array = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
sorted_array = bubble_sort(array)
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. The merge step is the key operation, and it is done by comparing the first element of each sub-array and putting the smaller one at the front of the merged array, then repeating this process for the remaining elements.

```python
def merge(left, right):
    i, j = 0, 0
    merged = []
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            merged.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    merged += left[i:]
    merged += right[j:]
    return merged


def merge_sort(array):
    if len(array) > 1:
        mid = len(array) // 2
        left = array[:mid]
        right = array[mid:]
        left = merge_sort(left)
        right = merge_sort(right)
        array = merge(left, right)
    return array

# Example usage:
array = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
sorted_array = merge_sort(array)
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Discussion and Comparison

#### Time Complexity
- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it makes n passes through the array in the worst case.
- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). This is due to its divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is divided into two halves, and the merge step takes O(n) time.

#### Space Complexity
- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of extra space.
- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort has a space complexity of O(n), as it uses temporary space to merge sub-arrays back together.

#### Stability
- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is a stable sort, meaning that it maintains the order of elements with equal keys.
- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is also a stable sort.

#### Practicality
- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is not practical for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity. It's easy to implement and understand, but it's not efficient.
- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is more practical for large datasets because of its O(n log n) time complexity. It's also efficient on large, sorted, or nearly sorted arrays because it avoids unnecessary comparisons.

#### Comparison
- Bubble sort is simple and can be used in educational contexts to teach sorting concepts. However, it is not recommended for sorting large arrays due to its poor performance.
- Merge sort is a more sophisticated algorithm that offers a significant improvement in performance over bubble sort for large datasets. It is a popular choice for sorting large amounts of data efficiently.

In summary, bubble sort is simple and stable but has poor performance, while merge sort is more complex but offers a better time complexity and is suitable for large datasets.<|im_end|>
