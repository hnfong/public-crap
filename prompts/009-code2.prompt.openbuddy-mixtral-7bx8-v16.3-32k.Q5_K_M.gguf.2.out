Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, you can follow these steps:
1. Open the file and read its contents into memory or load it in chunks if needed (for large files). You should end up with an array of strings representing names.
2. Implement the binary search algorithm on this array to find the target name or its insertion point (bisect_left behavior).
3. Return the position where the target was found, or the insertion point in case it's not present in the file.

Here's a Python function that implements these steps:
```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    try:
        with open(file_path) as f:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in f]  # Remove newlines and convert to list of names
        position = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
        return position if position < len(lines) else None
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
        return None
```
In this function, we first open the file and read its contents into a list of strings called `lines`. We then use Python's built-in `bisect_left` method from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the target name in the sorted list. If the target is found in the list, we return its position; otherwise, we return None or an appropriate error message if necessary.
