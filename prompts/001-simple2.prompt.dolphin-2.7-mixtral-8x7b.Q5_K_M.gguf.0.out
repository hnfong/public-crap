 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance. Some of them include:

1. It is a highly composite number with more divisors than any other number with fewer digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120).

2. It is a triangular number (sum of the first 12 numbers: 1+2+3+...+12 = 78) and also a hexagonal number.

3. It is a sublime number, meaning it is a product of consecutive primes: 5x4x3x2=120 (sublime numbers are the product of first four prime numbers).

4. In ancient Greek architecture, it was used as the ideal ratio for harmony and balance in design (e.g., the Parthenon).

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

Here, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / 2*1

x = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2

x = (7 ± sqrt(121)) / 2

x = (7 ± 11) / 2

The two possible solutions are:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 9

x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -2

So, the solutions for x in the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities 200 km apart while traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h, we need to calculate the total time taken for one round trip and then compare it with the total number of hours in a full day.

First, let's find out how long it takes to travel between the two cities:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time (one way) = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 h

Since there are two legs in a round trip, the total time for one round trip is:

Total time (one round trip) = 2 * Time (one way) = 2 * 3.33 h = 6.67 h

Now we need to find out how many full days' worth of hours there are in a day:

Total hours in a day = 24 h

Finally, divide the total number of hours needed for one round trip by the total number of hours in a full day:

Number of round trips = Total time (one round trip) / Total hours in a day

Number of round trips = 6.67 h / 24 h ≈ 0.28

Since you can't have a fraction of a round trip, we can say that the train could make approximately 1 round trip within a full day.
