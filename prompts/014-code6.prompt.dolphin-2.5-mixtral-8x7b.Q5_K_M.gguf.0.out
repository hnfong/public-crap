Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are some inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. Enter a number: 1 (positive integer)
In this case, the while loop keeps adding 1 to x each time until it becomes greater than or equal to infinity. However, since infinity is not attainable as a floating-point value in Python, the loop will continue infinitely, and "Done" will never be printed.

2. Enter a number: -1 (negative integer)
In this case, the while loop keeps subtracting 1 from x each time until it becomes greater than or equal to infinity. This is possible because when subtracting from a negative value, the result gets closer and closer to zero. However, once x reaches zero, the program will encounter an error due to trying to divide by zero:

```
x += inc
print("Done")
```

This is because `inc` is still -1 at this point, so the line `x += inc` effectively tries to set x to 0 + (-1), which results in a ZeroDivisionError. So, the output will be an error message instead of "Done".
