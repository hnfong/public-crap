Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file containing sorted names, we can read the file line by line, comparing the target name to the names read. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n) as we need to read the entire file. Instead, we can use a modified binary search algorithm to search the file directly.

The modified binary search algorithm can be implemented as follows:

1. Read the first two lines of the file to get the first and second names.
2. Compare the target name to the first and second names. If the target is between the first and second names, then the target must be in the middle of the range defined by these names. If the target is less than the first name, the target must be in the first half of the file. If the target is greater than the second name, the target must be in the second half of the file.
3. Repeat steps 2 until the target is found or the range of names is empty.

Here is the Python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that implements this algorithm:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Check if the target is in the first two lines
    if target in lines[0].strip() or target in lines[1].strip():
        return lines.index(lines[0].strip() if target in lines[0].strip() else lines[1].strip())

    # Define the range of names to search
    left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        name = lines[mid].strip()

        # Check if the target is found
        if target == name:
            return mid

        # Update the range of names to search
        if target < name:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    # Target not found
    return -1
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(n)) because it reduces the search space by half at each iteration. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to read the entire file into memory.<|im_end|>
