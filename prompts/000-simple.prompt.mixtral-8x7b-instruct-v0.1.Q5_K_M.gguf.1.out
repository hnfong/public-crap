 [/INST] Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4877
Q4: 349*683=238057
Q5: 6043*7489=45168007
Q6: x = 5 (to solve for x, first subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide both sides by 3)
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20 (calculated as .25 \* 80)
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you $5 in change.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units (perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side).
Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children (Katherine and her two brothers).
Q11: The expression evaluates to 10. According to the order of operations, we first divide 12 by 4 to get 3, then subtract 1 from it to get 2, and finally add 3 to it to get 5.
Q12: Each guest needs one slice, so five slices are needed in total.
Q13: The sale price is $20 (to find this, multiply the original price by the complement of the discount, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8).
Q14: There are 145 minutes left until 6:30 PM (this can be calculated as 180 - 35).
Q15: You would need 6 taxis for a group of 22 people, because each taxi carries 4 passengers and 4 doesn't divide evenly into 22.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the measure of the third angle is 87 degrees (calculated as 180 - 31 - 62).
