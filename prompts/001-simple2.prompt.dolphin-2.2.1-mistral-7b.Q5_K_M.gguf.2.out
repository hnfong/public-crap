 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and connections to various fields of mathematics. Here are some of its noteworthy properties:

1. It is divisible by every integer from 1 to 6 (excluding itself): 120 = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6
2. It has the greatest number of divisors among all numbers less than 100. Specifically, it has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.
3. It is the smallest perfect number in decimal form (i.e., a number whose divisors, excluding itself, sum up to the number). Its aliquot sum is 91 + 46 + 18 + 12 = 177, and 120 + 177 = 397.
4. In geometry, it is an octahedron's edge length (an octahedron has eight faces).
5. It appears in the Pythagorean triplet (120, 60, 84), which satisfies the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a = 120, b = 60, and c = 84.

Q2: To solve the given quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula method. I will provide both solutions:

Factoring method:
First, let's look for two numbers whose product is -18 and sum is -7. These numbers are -9 and 2. So, the equation can be factored as (x + 9)(x - 2) = 0. Now, we need to solve for x:
x + 9 = 0 => x = -9
x - 2 = 0 => x = 2

The solutions are x1 = -9 and x2 = 2.

Quadratic formula method:
Given the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, we can find the solutions using the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In our case, a=1, b=-7, and c=-18. So,
x = (-(-7) ± √((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x1 = (-7 + √121) / 2 or x2 = (-7 - √121) / 2
x1 ≈ -2.684 or x2 ≈ 3.684

The solutions are approximately x1 = -2.684 and x2 = 3.684.

Q3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between the two cities, which are 200 km apart. To find out how many round trips it can make within a full day (i.e., 24 hours), we need to divide the total distance by the travel time for one trip and multiply it by 24:

Travel time = Distance / Speed
Time per trip = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hrs (approximately)
Number of trips within a day = (24 hours) / (10/3 hours) = 7.2 trips (approximately)

Since it is not possible to make a fraction of a trip, the train can make 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.<|im_end|>
