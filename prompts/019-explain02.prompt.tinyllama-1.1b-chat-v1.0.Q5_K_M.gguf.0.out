China's National People's Congress (NPC) is the highest decision-making body of the Chinese government. It meets annually and is responsible for making policy decisions regarding the country's development, economy, and social welfare. The NPC is composed of elected representatives from all 10,142 counties in China and serves as a platform for the People's Republic of China to engage with its citizens on various issues.
Chinese politicians attend the NPC to discuss pressing national and international issues, make decisions on important policies, and approve budgets for the government. The NPC also plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political and economic future by determining which policies will be implemented and how they will impact different sectors of society.
For a young child who lives in London, attending the NPC might seem like a far-off event that takes place at the end of long days, but for Chinese politicians, it's an exciting opportunity to engage with their elected representatives and influence national and international policies. This experience can help build a sense of civic responsibility in young children and encourage them to become active members of society as they grow older.
