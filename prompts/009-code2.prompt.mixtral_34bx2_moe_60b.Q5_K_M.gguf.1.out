Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a sorted text file directly using O(log n) operations, we need to read and compare each line with the given target only once. We can achieve this by reading the file in chunks of size 2^n (i.e., doubling the chunk size at each step until reaching the end of the file or finding the target).

Here is a Python function that implements binary search on a sorted text file:
```python
import os
def read_lines(filepath):
    """Read all lines from a file and return them as a list."""
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f]

def binary_search_file(filepath, target):
    lines = read_lines(filepath)
    left, right = 0, len(lines)-1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lines[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif lines[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    # If the target was not found, return the insertion point.
    return left
```
The `read_lines` function reads all lines from a file and returns them as a list. The `binary_search_file` function takes the file path and the target string as input parameters and returns the position of the target in the file or the insertion point (i.e., where the target would be inserted if it were not present).

To perform the binary search, we iterate over a range from `left` to `right` using while loop. At each iteration, we compute the midpoint index (`mid`) and check whether the line at this position is equal to the target string. If they match, we return the midpoint index as the result.
If the line at the midpoint index is less than the target string, we know that the target must be in the right half of the remaining range (since all elements are sorted in lexicographical order) and update the left pointer accordingly. Similarly, if the line at the midpoint index is greater than the target string, we update the right pointer to exclude the left half of the remaining range.
If the loop terminates without finding a match, it means that the target was not present in the file. In this case, we return the left pointer as the insertion point (i.e., where the target would be inserted if it were not present).
