What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)


### Response:

The given Python code will never terminate because it enters an infinite loop where `x` is continuously multiplied by 1.001, and the condition for exiting the loop (`x < math.inf`) is never met as `math.inf` represents positive infinity in Python. Therefore, there won't be any output from this program.
