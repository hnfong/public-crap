Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Sure, here are two examples:

1. Enter a number: 0.0
```
Enter a number: 0.0
Done
```

2. Enter a negative number: -0.5
```
Enter a number: -0.5
Error: Invalid input. Please enter a positive number
```

Both of these examples show that the program will only accept numbers greater than or equal to 0 and will output "Done" once it reaches a limit of infinite precision (i.e., inf).
