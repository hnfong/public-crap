Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

The Federal Reserve is a big bank that helps keep money and the economy safe. It makes sure there's enough money in the world and keeps interest rates low, so people and businesses can borrow money to buy things. It's like a big babysitter for money!<|im_end|>
