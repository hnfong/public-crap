Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4897
Q4: 349*683=239367
Q5: 6043*7489=45181187 (This is a very large number, so it might not be the correct answer. I suggest checking again.)
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. The solution is x = 5.
Q7: What is 25% of 80? The result is 20.
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. The final change the shopkeeper should give me is $13 (if the total amount paid was $45).
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The result is 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? The answer is 4 (Katherine, two brothers, and one sister).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. The result is 4 (3+3-1=5, but since there's a division sign before addition, you need to follow the order of operations, which means doing the division first, so it becomes 3+3-1=5, then subtract 1 from the result: 5-1=4).
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? The answer depends on how many slices each guest should get. If everyone gets one slice, you would need 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The result is $20 (calculate 20% of $25 to be $5 off; then subtract that from the original cost).
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? There are 87 minutes left.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? The result is 6 (if all the taxis are fully occupied with four passengers, then you would need 6 taxis).
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? Since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, you subtract the two given angles from 180 to get the third angle (180-31-62=87). The answer is 87 degrees.
