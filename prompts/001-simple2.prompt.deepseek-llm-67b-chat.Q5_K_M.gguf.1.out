Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics and other fields. Here are some of them:

1. It is an abundant number, meaning that the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) is greater than 120. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, and 60, which sum up to 220.
   
2. It is the smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 5 (120 = 1 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5).

3. In base-10 positional notation, it is a Harshad number, as it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 / 3 equals to 40).
   
4. It is twice the triangular number 60. In fact, it forms a Ruth-Aaron pair with 60 since their prime factors are in reverse order: 2^3 * 3 * 5 for 120 and 2 * 3 ^2 * 5 for 60.
   
Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, first factorize it if possible or use the quadratic formula. The factors of this equation are not evident, so we will use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

In our case, a=1, b=-7, and c=-18. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

x = (7 ± √((-7)² - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2

So, the two possible solutions for x are:

x₁ = (7 + √121) / 2 and x₂ = (7 - √121) / 2

Q3: The train travels between cities at an average speed of 60 km/h. So, it takes 200km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours to complete one round trip. In a full day (24 hours), the train can make:

round trips per day = total time available for travel / time taken per round trip
= 24 h / 3.33 h = ~7.19

Since we cannot have a fraction of a round trip, it means that the train can complete approximately 7 full round trips between the two cities within a full day (ignoring any breaks or maintenance time).
