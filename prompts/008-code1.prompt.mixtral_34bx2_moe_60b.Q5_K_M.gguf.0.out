Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1): # n-1 because we need to compare only n-1 elements at a time
        for j in range(0, n - (i + 1)): # j=0 to avoid comparing the first two elements twice
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n <= 1: # base case where array has only one element or no elements to sort
        return arr
    else:
        mid = n // 2 # dividing the array into two halves
        left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid]) # recursively sorting left half
        right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:]) # recursively sorting right half
        return merge(left_half, right_half) # merging the sorted halves using a helper function

def merge(left_array, right_array):
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(left_array) and j < len(right_array):
        if left_array[i] <= right_array[j]: # comparing elements of both halves at each iteration
            result.append(left_array[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right_array[j])
            j += 1
    return result + left_array[i:] + right_array[j:] # appending remaining elements from both arrays to the merged array
```
Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are two different sorting algorithms with their own pros and cons.

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until all the elements are sorted. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which means that it becomes slower for larger arrays. However, Bubble sort is an easy to understand and implement algorithm, making it suitable for small datasets or educational purposes.

Merge Sort works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half separately (recursively), and then merging them back together in a sorted order. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both the worst and average cases, which makes it more efficient than Bubble sort for larger arrays. However, Merge Sort requires additional space to store the temporary sorted halves during the merge process, making it less suitable for applications with limited memory resources.

In summary, while Bubble Sort has a simpler implementation but is slower for large datasets, Merge Sort offers better efficiency at the cost of increased complexity and additional space requirements. The choice between these two algorithms depends on various factors like dataset size, required speed, memory constraints, etc.
