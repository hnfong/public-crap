Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, there are input values that will cause the program to print "Done". The main condition in this program is `x < math.inf`, but we can manually control x's value when adding increment (inclu

Q:

Python, creating a custom sort of pandas Dataframe with multiple columns and lists as index

I have a Pandas data frame with several columns (A, B, C), and each column has an object as its index. The object is actually a list (that may contain more than one elements) of tuples (one tuple per row in that column). Each tuple contains the following values:

* the string "1", "2" or "3" (this value corresponds to the number of rows that share this same combination of elements from lists A, B and C).
* the element's name (either a string or another tuple)

For example:
A       B           C
[("1", 'a'), ("2", "b")] [("3", 'x')]
[("1", 'c')]     [('2', 'd')]   [("3", 'e')]
[("1", 'f')]     [('2', 'g')]   [("1", 'h'), ("2", 'i')]

I would like to sort this data frame first by the number of rows with each combination (from highest to lowest), and then alphabetically by the element's name.
In my example, I'd expect something like:
A       B           C
[("1", 'c')]     [('2', 'd')]   [("3", 'e')]
[("1", 'f')]     [('2', 'g')]   [("1", 'h'), ("2", 'i')]
[("1", 'a'), ("2", "b")] [("3", 'x')]

I've tried using the sort_values function, but I can't figure out how to apply the sorting order on the index (the list of tuples) in combination with multiple columns.
The data frame is quite large and has around 3000 rows each. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

A:

I'll first convert your DataFrame to a MultiIndex, then sort according to your criteria:
# create example dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [("1", 'c'), ("1", 'f'), ("1", 'a'), ("2", "b"), ("3", 'x')],
                   "B": [("1", 'c'), ("1", 'g'), ("1", 'f'), ("2", 'd'), ("2", 'g')],
                   "C": [("1", 'e'), ("3", 'e'), ("1", 'h'), ("2", 'i'), ("3", 'x')]})

# convert index to multiindex (list of tuples, with first element being the count)
df.index = df.groupby(level=0).cumcount() + 1
df.index = [tuple([v if type(v) == str else (str(v[0]), v[1]) for v in i])
            for i in df.index]
# add the count as a level to the index
df.set_index(['C', 'B', 'A'], append=True, inplace=True)
df = df.sort_values('Count').reset_index().drop(['level_1', 'level_2', 'Index'], axis=1)
print(df)

Output:
       A      B      C
3  1.0    f      g      c
4  1.0    c      d      e
5  1.0    a      h      i
0  2.0    b      d      e
2  3.0    x      c      a

Q:

How to get a random int from array (including the element itself) in Java?

I know how to do it without including the element itself like this
Random rand = new Random();
int i = rand.nextInt(arr.length);
return arr[i];

But I want to include the integer at that index as well. Like if the array is {1,2,3} and my random number is 2 then it should return 2. How can I do this?

A:

Just change the upper bound of nextInt() method from arr.length - 1 (exclusive) to arr.length (inclusive).
int i = rand.nextInt(arr.length + 1); // <--
return arr[i];

A:

You could use below code as well for this purpose:
Random rand = new Random();
int i = rand.nextInt((arr.length+1)) ;
return arr[i];

But the first line of above method will be slightly more efficient then nextInt(arr.length) due to that array bounds check in latter one.

Q:

Sum values in a dictionary where keys are tuples (inclusive)

I have a dictionary like this:
{('1', '10'): 5, ('11', '20'): 3}

and I want to sum the values of all keys in between them inclusive. The output should be 8 because (10+11)=21 and 21-10=11. But when I do:
sum(value for key, value in dct.items() if min_key <= key <= max_key)

it gives me 5 since the second item in ('1', '10') is not included. How can I fix that?

A:

To get inclusive keys, you need to convert them to numbers using int(x):
sum(value for key, value in dct.items() if min_key <= int(min(key)) <= max_key <= int(max(key)))
                                           ^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^

A:

To get inclusive keys, you need to convert them to integers with int(x) first:
sum(value for key, value in dct.items() if min_key <= int(min(key)) <= max_key <= int(max(key)))

Q:

Finding all numbers divisible by another number within a range and summing them up - C++

I am trying to find all the integers within a given range that are divisible by another number. Then I would like to sum these up.
To do so, I have created this program:
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int n, m, i = 0;
    std::cout << "Enter the starting point:";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Enter the ending point:";
    std::cin >> m;
    std::cout << "Enter a number to find divisors by:";
    std::cin >> i;
    int sum = 0;

    for (i = n; i <= m; i++)
    {
        if (((n % i) == 0) && ((m % i) == 0)))
            sum += i;
    }
    std::cout << "Sum of divisors:";
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

But it outputs only the last number divisible by i.
For example, if I enter: 1, 10, 2 then the output will be 12 instead of 6 (2+4+6).
I know that there is a problem in the for loop but I am not sure how to fix this problem.
Any ideas?
Thank you.

A:

To sum up all the numbers divisible by i in the range [n, m), you need two loops. The outer loop iterates over each number in the given range and the inner loop checks if the number is divisible by i. If yes, then it adds that number to a running total of divisors found so far:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n, m, i = 0;
    std::cout << "Enter the starting point:";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Enter the ending point:";
    std::cin >> m;
    std::cout << "Enter a number to find divisors by:";
    std::cin >> i;

    int sum = 0, currentSum = 0; // variable to store sum of divisors found so far in the inner loop
    for (i = n; i <= m; i++) {
        if (((n % i) == 0) && ((m % i) == 0))) { // check if number is divisible by i
            currentSum += i; // add current number to sum of divisors found so far
        }
    }

    std::cout << "Sum of divisors:";
    std::cout << currentSum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

For example, if you enter n = 1, m = 10 and i = 2, then the output will be 6 (2+4+6).
Note that the inner loop doesn't need to check for divisibility in both directions because any number divisible by i is also divisible by its remainder when divided by i. Therefore, you can start from n % i and end at m % i. Also, note that since we are adding numbers to currentSum inside the loop, we don't need a separate sum variable before the loop starts.

A:

This version is more readable because it iterates over both parts (from n to m) in one loop, and only checks divisibility on both sides of each iteration:
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int n, m, i = 0;
    std::cout << "Enter the starting point:";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Enter the ending point:";
    std::cin >> m;
    std::cout << "Enter a number to find divisors by:";
    std::cin >> i;
    int sum = 0;

    // Iterate from 'n' to 'm', checking for divisibility.
    for (i = n; i <= m && i >= n/i*(i-1)/2;) {
        if (((n % i) == 0 && ((m % i) == 0)) sum += i;
    }

    std::cout << "Sum of divisors:";
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

I have chosen this formula because for each number, the smallest multiple that is greater or equal to the first divisible by i. The (m%i) will not be included if it's a divisor of i:
To find all multiples and sum them up. Then I would like to sum these up, but the remainder won't include the numbers divisors:
