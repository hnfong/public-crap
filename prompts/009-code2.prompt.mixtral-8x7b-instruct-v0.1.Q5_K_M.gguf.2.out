Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
 [/INST] Performing a binary search on a text file directly can be achieved by using the built-in `seek()` method to efficiently move the file pointer to the middle of the file, and then reading a small portion of the file to determine whether the target value is in the left or right half. This process is repeated on the appropriate half until the target value is found or it is determined that it does not exist in the file.

Here's an implementation of `binary_search_file()` using this approach:
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file with 'rb' mode to perform binary search on bytes
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Get the size of the file and calculate the middle position
        file_size = f.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end of file and get its size
        half = file_size // 2

        # Perform binary search
        while half > 0:
            # Move the file pointer to the middle position
            f.seek(half)

            # Read a small portion of the file (1KB in this case)
            chunk = f.read(1024)

            # Determine if target is in the left or right half
            if len(chunk) == 0 or ord(chunk[-1]) < ord(target[0]):
                # Target is after the current position, search on the right half
                f.seek(half, 1)  # Move the file pointer half way into the right half
                half = file_size - half // 2  # Update half for the new search range
            else:
                # Target is before or at the current position, search on the left half
                file_size = half  # Limit the search range to [0, half]
                half = half // 2  # Update half for the new search range

        # If target is found or would be inserted at this position
        if file_size == 0 or f.read(1).decode() < target:
            return file_size

    # Target not found, return insertion point
    return 0
```
This implementation uses the `ord()` function to convert characters to their corresponding ASCII values for comparison purposes, and the `decode()` method to convert bytes back into a string. The binary search is performed using the file's size to determine the search range, with the file pointer being adjusted accordingly.

Keep in mind that this implementation assumes that lines are shorter than 1KB and that the target character exists in the input file. If these assumptions don't hold for your use case, you may need to adjust the chunk size or handle special cases differently.
