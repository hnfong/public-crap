Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Sure, here are some inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. Input: "Enter a number: "
Output: "Enter a number"

2. Input: "Enter a number: 5"
Output: "Done"

3. Input: "Enter a number: 12.5"
Output: "Done"

4. Input: "Enter a number: inf"
Output: "Done"

5. Input: "Enter a number: -5"
Output: "Done"

6. Input: "Enter a number: 0.1"
Output: "Done"

7. Input: "Enter a number: 1e10"
Output: "Done"

Note that even though the program only increments the variable `x`, it will loop infinitely if the user enters an invalid input. Therefore, any input that does not satisfy the condition `x < math.inf` will lead to the output "Done".
