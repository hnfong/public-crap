What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>

The Python interpreter will raise a "RuntimeError" with message: 'math range error'. This is because the number of iterations in the loop exceeds the maximum limit for an int, which results in an overflow condition. In this case, the value of x becomes too large to represent as a float or double precision floating point number and hence Python raises a Runtime Error indicating "Math Range Error".
