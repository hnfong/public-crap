Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
- It is a pentagonal number, which means it can be represented as the sum of the first 12 natural numbers (1+2+3+...+12).
- It's a triangular number when doubled (240), meaning it's the sum of the first n natural numbers for some n, but in this case, it's not directly a triangular number itself; the closest triangular number is 121 (which is 11^2).
- It is a highly composite number, having more factors than any number less than it. Its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
- It's the smallest number that is divisible by the numbers 1 through 6.
- In Roman numerals, it's CXX.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0\), you can use factoring or the quadratic formula. The equation seems factorable.

Step 1: Look for two numbers that multiply to \(-18\) (the product of the coefficient of \(x^2\) which is 1, and the constant term -18) and add up to \(-7\) (the coefficient of \(x\)).

Step 2: Those numbers are -9 and 2.
So, \(x^2 - 9x + 2x - 18 = 0\)

Step 3: Group them to factor by grouping: \((x^2 - 9x) + (2x - 18) = 0\)

Step 4: Factor out common terms: \(x(x - 9) + 2(x - 9) = 0\)

Step 5: Factor out the common factor \(x - 9\): \((x + 2)(x - 9) = 0\)

Step 6: Set each factor equal to zero: \(x + 2 = 0\) or \(x - 9 = 0\)

So, the solutions are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 9\).

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips, first find out how long it takes for one round trip.

Distance of one trip = 200 km (since it's a round trip, we double the distance between the cities).

Speed of the train = 60 km/h.

Time for one trip = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours or approximately 3.33 hours.

A full day has 24 hours.

Number of round trips = Total time available / Time for one round trip = 24 hours / 3.33 hours = approximately 7.20.

Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, it can make 7 complete round trips within a full day.

Remember, these calculations assume no time is lost at the stations, which is a simplification in real-world scenarios.
