Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The purpose of this Python function is to sort an array in ascending order. The function takes an input list, and returns a sorted version of it by placing all elements less than or equal to the first element at the beginning of the list, followed by the first element, and then all other elements greater than the first one.

The given code has several issues:

1. It's not clear what 's' function is supposed to do. The comment does not clearly explain its purpose. The function name itself (which is a bit unusual for Python) could be improved. In Python, it would be more common to use descriptive variable names such as 'sort_array' or 'ascending_sort'.
2. There's no return statement after the first if condition in the function. This means that even if the function is called with an argument that can be sorted, it will still just return the input list without doing anything with it.
3. The variable names are not meaningful. It would be better to use more meaningful variable names like 'first', 'less_than', and 'greater_than' instead of 'p', 'l', and 'r'. 
4. The function uses a lot of list comprehensions which can make the code harder to read and understand, especially if the list is long. In this case, it would be better to use traditional loops and conditionals for simplicity.
5. There are no type annotations in the function signature. Adding type annotations can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's a possible implementation in Rust:

```rust
fn sort_array(a: &mut Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    if a.len() <= 1 {
        return a;
    }
    let first = a[0];
    let less_than = a[1..].iter().filter(|&x| x <= first).cloned().collect();
    let greater_than = &mut a[1..].iter().filter(|&x| x > first).cloned().collect();
    return mutable_concat(&less_than, vec![first], &greater_than);
}
```

In this Rust implementation:

- The function takes the input array by reference instead of value. This allows us to modify the original array in-place without creating a new one.
- We use `iter()` and `filter()` to create `less_than` and `greater_than` vectors, which are then cloned and converted back into `Vec<i32>` to avoid changing the input vector.
- We use `cloned()` to get a copy of the original list or vector to prevent changes to the original object from affecting other parts of the code.
- We use `mutable_concat()` to concatenate two vectors, which is more efficient than using the `+` operator in this case because it avoids creating unnecessary new vectors.
- We also add type annotations to make the function signature clearer and easier to understand.
