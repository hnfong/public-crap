 The National People's Congress is like a very big group of people who make important decisions for the country of China. They are kind of like the leaders and helpers who come together to talk about how to make things better for everyone living there. Just like your mommy and daddy make choices for your family, these people help decide what's best for all the people in China.<|im_end|>
