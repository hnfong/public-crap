Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:

- It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more factors than any number less than itself. Its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
- It is the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to 5 (120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5).
- In base 10, it is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits.
- It is also a practical number because all smaller positive numbers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of 120 (for example, 7 = 3 + 4).
- In geometry, 120 is related to regular polyhedra, as it's the number of vertices in a dodecahedron or the number of faces in an icosahedron (in both cases, the solid has 60 edges).

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it:

(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions for x:

x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To calculate how many round trips a train can make within a full day (24 hours), we first determine how long it takes to travel from one city to the other and back once:

Single trip distance: 200 km
Average speed: 60 km/h

Time for a single trip = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours or approximately 3.33 hours.

Since a round trip includes going to one city and returning, the total time for a round trip is:

Total round trip time = 2 * (10/3) hours ≈ 6.67 hours

Now we can calculate the number of full round trips in 24 hours:

Number of round trips = Total hours in a day / Time per round trip
= 24 hours / 6.67 hours ≈ 3.59

Since we cannot make a fraction of a round trip, the train can make 3 complete round trips within a full day.
