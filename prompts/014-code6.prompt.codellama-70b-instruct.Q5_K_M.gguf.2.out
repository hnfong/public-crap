  Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Ah, nice try! ðŸ˜„ While this program seems innocuous at first glance, it's actually a common example in computer science called an infinite loop or "trapdoor" function. This program will never terminate (i.e., reach the print statement), regardless of what number is entered as input.

The reason for this is that the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, because no matter how large a floating-point number you add to `x`, it will still be finite, and thus less than infinity (`math.inf`). Therefore, the loop will continue indefinitely, and never reach the "Done" output.

So, to answer your question: No, there is no input that will lead to the program printing "Done". ðŸ˜‰ Source: assistant
