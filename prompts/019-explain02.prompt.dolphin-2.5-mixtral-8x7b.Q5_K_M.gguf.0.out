 The Chinese National People's Congress is like a big meeting where important people from all parts of China come together to make decisions for their country, just like how your parents or teachers make decisions for you at home and school. These people discuss things like laws, rules, and plans to help the country grow and be better for everyone who lives there, kind of like how we decide on rules in games so everyone can have fun playing together. This big meeting happens once a year, and everyone in China knows that their leaders are working hard to make good choices for them.
