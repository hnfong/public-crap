 Sure kiddo, imagine that there is an important group of people in China, like your school class, but much bigger! Their job is to help make decisions for the whole country, like how we choose what games to play in class. They're called the "National People Congress". They talk about important things like how to keep everyone healthy and happy. When they all agree on something, it's like when you and your friends decide together what snack to have at break time. So this group helps keep China running smoothly, just like our teachers help us learn in school.
