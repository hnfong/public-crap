Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

 Yo, listen up, I got somethin' to say about this big bank called the Fed,
It's like the boss of all banks, but don't think they'll ever run outta bread.

They control the money supply, so cash stays in line,
Help businesses borrow, and keep prices on track - that's their design.

When things are lookin' tough, or economy is down,
The Fed steps up, and makes sure the whole country won't drown.

Lower interest rates mean more dough to spend,
And when it comes to inflation, they make sure prices don't ascend.

They might not wear bling-blings or have a gold chain,
But they're still in control of the game.

So remember, when you see that dollar bill, and wonder where it all begins,
Just know the Federal Reserve is runnin' things - so everybody wins.
