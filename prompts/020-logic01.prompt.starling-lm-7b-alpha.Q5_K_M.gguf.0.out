If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, it can be called "consistent" in the sense that it does not lead to contradictions within its own framework. However, it may still be considered "tautological" in the sense that its conclusions can be derived in a trivial or obvious manner.

For example, consider the following axiomatic system:

1. A ≡ B (A is equivalent to B)
2. B ≡ C (B is equivalent to C)
3. A ≡ C (From 1 and 2, since A ≡ B and B ≡ C, we can conclude that A ≡ C)

In this system, the conclusion (A ≡ C) is tautological because it is derived in an obvious manner from the given axioms. However, the system is also consistent because it does not lead to any contradictions within its own framework.

On the other hand, consider the following logic framework:

P ≡ P (The proposition P is equivalent to itself)
¬P ≡ P (The negation of P is equivalent to P)

In this framework, we can derive the contradictory conclusion that "P and ¬P are both true at the same time," which is a clear sign of inconsistency. However, it is not tautological because the conclusion is not derived in an obvious or trivial manner.

In summary, a consistent theory is one that does not lead to contradictions within its own framework, while a tautological theory is one where its conclusions can be derived in a trivial or obvious manner. The two concepts are related but distinct.

Here are some additional examples of consistent and tautological theories:

Consistent but not tautological:
Peano Arithmetic: This is a logical framework for the natural numbers that includes axioms for addition and multiplication. While it is consistent (we have not found any contradictions within the framework), it is not tautological because the proofs of its theorems are not always trivial or obvious.

Tautological but not consistent:
Propositional logic with self-reference: This is a logical framework that includes axioms and rules of inference for propositions that refer to themselves. While it is tautological (since many conclusions can be derived in an obvious manner), it is not consistent (since self-referential statements can lead to contradictions).

In general, determining the consistency and tautology of a theory is an important part of mathematical practice, and understanding the distinction between the two concepts is essential for developing rigorous and reliable mathematical proofs.

These resources will provide you with a deeper understanding of consistency and tautology in mathematics, as well as the broader context in which these concepts have evolved.

Additionally, it's worth noting that consistency and tautology are not necessarily mutually exclusive concepts. A theory can be consistent without being tautological, and vice versa. Consistency refers to the absence of contradictions within a theory, while tautology refers to the triviality or obviousness of a theory's conclusions. Understanding the nuances between these concepts is crucial for developing rigorous mathematical proofs and understanding the fundamental principles of mathematics.

In conclusion, while consistency and tautology are related concepts, they are not synonymous. Consistency refers to the absence of contradictions within a theory, while tautology refers to the trivial or obvious nature of a theory's conclusions. Understanding the distinction between these concepts is essential for developing sound mathematical practices and theories.
