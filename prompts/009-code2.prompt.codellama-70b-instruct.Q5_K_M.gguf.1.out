  Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 This code defines a function `binary_search_file` that takes a file path and a target name as input. It uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the target name in the sorted file. The position is then used to check if an exact match for the target exists at that location, and both the position and whether an exact match was found are returned as a dictionary.

Note that this implementation assumes each line of the text file contains one name only (without any additional characters), and that there are no duplicates in the file. If your actual data may have different formats or duplicate names, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Source: assistant
