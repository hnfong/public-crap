Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

 Python Implementation of Bubble Sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

    return arr
```

Python Implementation of Merge Sort:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                arr[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left):
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right):
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```

Comparison:

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). Bubble sort is not suitable for large data sets as its performance deteriorates quadratically as the input size increases.

Merge sort, on the other hand, is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a sorted list), then repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. Merge sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). It is more efficient than bubble sort for large data sets since its performance scales logarithmically with the input size.

In summary, bubble sort is a simple but inefficient algorithm, while merge sort is more complex but much faster for large data sets.
