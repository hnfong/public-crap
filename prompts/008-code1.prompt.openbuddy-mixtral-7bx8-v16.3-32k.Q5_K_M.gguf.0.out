Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Here is an example implementation of Bubble Sort in Python:
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```
And here is an example implementation of Merge Sort in Python:
```python
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]

        mergeSort(L)
        mergeSort(R)

        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```
Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are two different sorting algorithms that have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements in the array, swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, but it has a time complexity of O(n^2) which makes it inefficient for large arrays.

Merge Sort, on the other hand, uses a divide and conquer approach to sort the elements in an array. It splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray recursively using merge sort, and then merges those sorted subarrays back together to produce the final sorted array. The advantage of this method is its time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it much faster than bubble sort for large arrays. However, Merge Sort requires more memory because it needs an extra space to store the temporary merged subarrays.

In summary, Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are two different algorithms with their own trade-offs. Bubble Sort is simple but slow, while Merge Sort is faster but complex. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application.
