Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Katherine has 4 children, and each child has 3 siblings (their parents). So, Katherine's mother has 4 x 3 = 12 children.

The result of this expression is 81/8 - 1.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
To determine how many slices of cake Tom needs for the birthday party, we can calculate the number of guests who still need to be served:
S = # of guests - # of guests left to be served
S = 5 - 5
S = 0
Tom will need 0 slices of cake for his birthday party.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
The sale price of a shirt originally costing $25 on sale for 20% off is $25 - $25 * 0.2 = $75.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
To find the remaining minutes until 6:30 PM, we can subtract the current time from 6:30:
T = 6:30 - T
T = 2 hours
Remaining minutes = (6:30 - 2) * 60 = 120 minutes
So, there are 120 minutes left until 6:30 PM.<|im_end|>
