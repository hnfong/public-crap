Here are the instructions for using a Bai Hua (standard Mandarin) and a standard Chinese (Pinyin) word list for writing in Mandarin Chinese:

1. Choose a Bai Hua word from the word list.
2. Translate the word into standard Chinese (Pinyin) using the Pinyin pronunciation guide.
3. Write the Pinyin in the correct position (i.e., without the Chinese characters) on the sheet.
4. Write the Bai Hua word in Chinese characters using the Pinyin pronunciation guide.

Here's an example of writing a standard Chinese word:

```
# 詞: 廣東話

1. 佢咁細個就可以代表香港參加羽毛球比賽，認真威水。

2. ...
...
10. ...

完成10個例句
```

Note: The Bai Hua word list contains both standard Chinese characters and simplified Chinese characters. Use the simplified characters for words that are commonly used in everyday language, such as "廣東話" or "威水".

For example, the word "廣東話" can be written using simplified Chinese characters as "广东话", while "威水" can be written using both simplified and traditional characters as "威賓".

I hope this helps!</s>
