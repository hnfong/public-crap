Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log n) operations, we can use the `os.stat()` function to get the size of the file and then read the required lines from the file in chunks, rather than loading the entire file into memory. This way, we reduce memory usage and only perform necessary I/O operations.

Here's a Python function that implements binary search on a text file using this approach:
```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Get the size of the file in bytes
    file_size = os.stat(file_path).st_size
    
    # Calculate the number of lines in the file (assuming avg line length is 100)
    num_lines = file_size // 100
    
    # Initialize variables for binary search
    low, high = 0, num_lines - 1
    insertion_point = -1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Read the chunk of lines containing the middle line
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            file.seek(mid * 100)  # Move to the start of the required block
            
            for i in range(max(mid - 5, 0), min(mid + 6, num_lines)):
                line = file.readline().strip()
                
                if insertion_point == -1 and target < line:
                    # Update the insertion point if it hasn't been set yet or
                    # if the current line is larger than the target
                    insertion_point = i
                    
                elif not line:  # If we reached EOF before finding the target
                    break
                
        if line == target:
            return mid  # Found the target, return its position
        
        elif insertion_point != -1 and (mid < insertion_point or high <= insertion_point):
            # We've found the correct insertion point; stop searching
            break
        
        elif line < target:
            low = mid + 1
            
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return insertion_point
```
This function takes a file path and a target name as input, and returns the position of the target in the sorted list if found. If the target is not present, it returns the correct insertion point (as per "bisect\_left"). Note that this implementation assumes an average line length of 100 characters; you may need to adjust this value depending on your file's actual contents.
