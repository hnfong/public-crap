Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we need to read the file line by line and maintain the position of each line in memory while performing the search.

Here's an implementation in Python:
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file for reading
    with open(file_path) as f:
        # Read all lines and store their positions
        line_positions = [f.tell() for line in f]

        # Find the insertion point using binary search
        left, right = 0, len(line_positions) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            # Compare the target with the mid-point line
            f.seek(line_positions[mid])
            if f.readline().strip() == target:
                return mid
            elif f.readline().strip() < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return right
```
This function first reads all lines of the file and stores their positions in memory. Then it performs a binary search on these positions to find the position where the target should be inserted or if the target already exists in the file. Note that this approach requires reading the entire file into memory, which may not be feasible for large files.
