Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. Here's an implementation of bubble sort in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        # If no swap has been performed in this pass, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```

Merge Sort:

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer strategy. It divides an unsorted list into smaller sub-lists until each sub-list contains only one element. Then it repeatedly merges these sorted sublists together to form larger and larger sorted lists until there's one big sorted list left, which is the original list. Here's an implementation of merge sort in Python:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            merged.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    merged.extend(left[i:])
    merged.extend(right[j:])
    return merged
```

Comparison:

- Time Complexity: Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, but it can be improved to O(n) in the best case if the list is already sorted. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.
- Space Complexity: Bubble sort doesn't require any extra space, while merge sort requires additional storage for merging sub-lists. The space requirement is O(n) in the worst case.
- Stability: Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it will not change the relative order of elements that compare as equal. Merge sort is also a stable sorting algorithm.
- In-place Sorting: Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm because it doesn't require any additional memory to store intermediate results. Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, as it requires additional space for merging sub-lists.
