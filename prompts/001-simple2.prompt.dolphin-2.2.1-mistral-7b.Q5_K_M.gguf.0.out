Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
- It's a cube of 10 (i.e., 10^3).
- It is divisible by all integers from 1 to 6.
- Its square, 14400, has an even number of digits.
- The sum of its digits is 9 (1+2+0 = 3), which is a perfect square (3^2=9).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring:
(x + 6)(x - 3) = 0.

Solving for x: x = -6 or x = 3

So, there are two solutions to this equation: x = -6 and x = 3.

Q3: In a full day, there are 24 hours. Assuming the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, we can calculate how many round trips it can make in one day by using the formula time = distance/speed.

Distance between cities = 200km (one way).
Time taken for one trip = 200km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours.

Now, to determine the number of round trips:
24 hours / 3.33 hours per trip = 7.19 rounded down to 7 trips.

So, the train can make 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.<|im_end|>
