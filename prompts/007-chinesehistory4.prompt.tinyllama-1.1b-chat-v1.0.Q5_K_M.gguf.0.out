Song dynasty political failures can be evaluated from an academic perspective. The following analysis uses a critical and historical lens to assess the shortcomings of Song government.

Firstly, the Song's political system was characterized by a one-party state. There was no constitutional protection for individual freedoms or opposition voices in the government. This resulted in an absolute monarchy that lacked checks and balances, which led to excessive power concentrated in the emperor's hands, resulting in autocracy.

Secondly, there were severe economic problems during Song dynasty. The country suffered from a shortage of resources such as food, goods, and labor, leading to high levels of poverty and deprivation among the people. This led to unrest and rebellions, which further weakened the Song government's authority.

Thirdly, the Song dynasty experienced several military campaigns, including the Qin–Han wars (31 BC-280 AD), the Jin–Southern Xiongnu wars (6th century AD-935 AD), and the Northern and Southern dynasties' invasions of China (476-589 AD). These military campaigns resulted in significant territorial losses, economic decline, and social unrest.

Finally, Song dynasty political failures were also due to a lack of centralized administrative apparatus, which hindered effective governance and control over the vast country. This resulted in corruption, lack of accountability, and a lack of efficient administration, leading to a deteriorating public welfare situation.

In summary, Song dynasty political failures were characterized by an absolute monarchy with autocratic power, military campaigns, economic problems, and administrative deficiencies. The emperor's power was excessive, resulting in autocracy and social unrest, which further weakened the Song government's authority.
