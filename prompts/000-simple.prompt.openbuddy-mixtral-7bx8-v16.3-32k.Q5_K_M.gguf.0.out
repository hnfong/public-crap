Q1: The answer is 2.
Q2: The answer is 42.
Q3: To calculate this multiplication, you can use a calculator or long multiplication method: (80+3)*59=4647. So the result is 4647.
Q4: Using a similar approach as in Q3, we get that 349*683 = 235127.
Q5: For this multiplication, you can use either a calculator or long multiplication method: (6043+0)*(7489-0) = 45272667. So the result is 45272667.
Q6: To solve for x in the equation, follow these steps: 1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side (3x = 15). Then divide by 3 to get the value of x (x = 5). So the answer is x=5.
Q7: To find 25% of 80, multiply 80 by 0.25 (which represents 25% as a decimal): 80 * 0.25 = 20. The result is 20.
Q8: If you gave the shopkeeper two $20 bills and an additional five dollar bill, she should give you back one ten-dollar bill and six one-dollar bills in change (30 + 6 = 36). So the final change the shopkeeper should give you is $15 - $36 = -$21.
Q9: The perimeter of a square can be found by multiplying its side length by four: Perimeter = 4 * Side Length = 4 * 5 = 20 units. So the result is 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has two sons (Katherine's brothers) and one daughter (Katherine), which adds up to three children in total. The answer is 3.
Q11: To evaluate this expression, follow these steps: Start with the division first (3 + (12 / 4)) = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4. So the result of the expression is 4.
Q12: If there are 5 guests and each guest needs one slice, then they need 5 slices in total. The answer is 5 slices.
Q13: To find the sale price, first calculate the discount amount (20% of $25) by multiplying the original cost ($25) by 0.20 (20% as a decimal): $25 * 0.20 = $5. Subtract this discount from the original cost: $25 - $5 = $20. So the sale price is $20.
Q14: To find how many minutes are left, first calculate the total number of hours and minutes between 3:45 PM and 6:30 PM (2 hours and 45 minutes). Subtract this from one hour to convert it into minutes: (6 * 60) + 30 = 390 minutes. Then subtract 15 minutes for the difference in time between 6:30 PM and 7:00 PM: 390 - 15 = 375 minutes. So there are 375 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
Q15: To find out how many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people, divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi (4 passengers): 22 / 4 = 5.5. Since you cannot have half a taxi, round up to get 6 taxis needed. The answer is 6 taxis.
Q16: To find the measure of the third angle in the triangle, first add the measures of the two given angles (31 + 62 = 93 degrees). Since the sum of all three angles in a triangle must be 180 degrees, subtract this from 180 to get the measure of the third angle: 180 - 93 = 87 degrees. So the measure of the third angle is 87 degrees.
