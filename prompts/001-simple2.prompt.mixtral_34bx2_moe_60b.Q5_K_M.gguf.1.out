Answers for all these questions:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:
  - It is the product of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60).
  - It is the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd integers in two different ways (9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 60 and 17 + 19 = 36).
  - In geometry, it is the order of the symmetric group on five elements (S5).
  - It is also a highly composite number, meaning that it has more factors than any smaller positive integer except for its prime factor multiples.

Q2: To solve x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Here, a=1, b=-7 and c=-18. 
  - First, calculate b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18) = 49 + 72 = 121
  - Next, find the discriminant by taking the square root of this result: sqrt(121) = 11.
  - Now, we can substitute these values back into the quadratic formula: x = (-(-7) ± 11) / (2*1) = 7 + 11/2 or 7 - 11/2. Simplifying, we get two possible solutions for x: 9 and -6/2 = -3.

Q3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart, it would take the following time to make one round trip (assuming the return journey is also 200km):
  - Time taken for one trip = Distance / Speed = 200km / 60km/h = 3.33 hours.
  - Since a full day is equal to 24 hours, the number of round trips that can be made within a full day is: Number of round trips = Time available / Time taken per trip = 24 hrs / 3.33 hrs per trip ≈ 7.21 round trips.
  - Since we cannot have a fraction of a round trip, it means the train can make exactly 7 full round trips between the two cities within one day.
