Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, and if necessary, suggest a better sentence. If the sentence does not need changes, just output "(Good translation!)"

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. (Good translation!)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output "(Good translation!)" if the existing translation does not need changes.
