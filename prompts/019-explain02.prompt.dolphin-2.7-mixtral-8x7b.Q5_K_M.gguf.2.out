Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

 The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big meeting that happens every year in China. It's like when all your classmates gather together at school, but this time it's for grown-ups and they make important decisions about the whole country! These people who come to the meeting are chosen from different parts of China, so everyone gets their voice heard. They talk about things that will help make life better for the people in China, like making new laws or fixing problems in the country. Just like your school principal helps you have a good day at school, the leaders in the NPC want to make sure that the people in China are happy and safe.
