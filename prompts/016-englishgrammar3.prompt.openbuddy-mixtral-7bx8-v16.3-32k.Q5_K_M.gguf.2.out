Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give the rating, optionally with comments (on the same line) in the format shown above.

A. Rating: 3 (The sentence structure is not clear and may be difficult for some native speakers to understand.)
B. Rating: 4 (No obvious flaws or problems in the translation, but it could have been written more naturally as "He's a magnanimous person who doesn't quibble over trivial matters with his children.")
C. Rating: 3 ("There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it" sounds better and flows more naturally in English.)
D. Rating: 4 (No obvious flaws or problems in the translation, but "praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender" could be rephrased as "compliments his girlfriend's tenderness in front of his colleagues.")
E. Rating: 5 ("I take the metro to school every day." is a clear and natural translation.)
