The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big group of people in China who help make important decisions for their country, just like how grown-ups sometimes talk about what's best for you and your family. They meet together to discuss problems, share ideas, and vote on solutions that they think will help everyone live better lives. Just like how your parents or teachers make rules for the classroom or playground, China's National People's Congress helps make sure their country runs smoothly so people in China can be happy and safe too!
