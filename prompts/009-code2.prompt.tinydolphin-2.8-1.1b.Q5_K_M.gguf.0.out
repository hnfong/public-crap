Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 Binary Search is an algorithm that works by dividing the search range into halves and iterating through both halves. If the current middle value matches the target value, we know that our search space has ended at that location. This saves us from having to sort the entire file.

The binary_search_file function takes a filename (file_path) and an integer target as arguments. It uses Python's built-in `bisect` library to perform the binary search on the file, which is guaranteed to have at most O(log(n)) operations.

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
import os
from bisect import bisect_left

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        for line in file:
            if line.strip() == str(target).lower():
                return bisect_left(file, int(line))
    print("Target not found")
    
# Test the function with your example text file
binary_search_file('example.txt', 5)  # Output: 1
