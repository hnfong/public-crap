Answers to your questions:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance. It's a composite number that is divisible by its factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120). It's also the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to 6. In mathematics, it is known as the triangular number (the sum of the first six positive integers), the hexagonal number (the count of points in a regular hexagon with side length six), and the number of ways to partition a set of four objects into two subsets. Additionally, 120 is the only number that can be divided by both 5 and 6 without having any remainder.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we need to factorize it. By trial and error or using a quadratic formula solver (if the coefficients are more complex), we find that the factors of the equation are (x-9)(x+2). Therefore, the solutions for x in this equation are 9 and -2.

Q3: Given that the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart and it's assumed that the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we can find how many round trips (there and back) it makes within a full day. There are 24 hours in a day, so we need to divide the total distance of one trip by the speed and then multiply by 2 (for both ways):

Number of round trips = Total distance / Speed x 2
= 200 km / 60 km/h x 2
= 4 round trips

So, if there are no breaks or delays during its travel time, the train can make 4 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
