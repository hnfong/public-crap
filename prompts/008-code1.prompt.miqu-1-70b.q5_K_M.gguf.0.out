Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Here are the Python implementations for Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

```python
# Bubble Sort Algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
  
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Last i elements are already sorted, so inner loop will go until n-i-1
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if current element is greater than next
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

```python
# Merge Sort Algorithm
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr)//2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]
    return merge(merge_sort(left_half), merge_sort(right_half))

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. This algorithm has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted.

Merge Sort, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by recursively breaking down a list into sublists until each sublist consists of a single element, and then merging those sublists in order to produce a new sorted list. The merge sort algorithm has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

In terms of efficiency, Merge Sort outperforms Bubble Sort as it has a lower time complexity. However, Merge Sort requires additional memory space for the merging process, whereas Bubble Sort only needs a constant amount of extra space. Therefore, if memory usage is a concern, Bubble Sort might be preferred over Merge Sort despite its slower speed.
