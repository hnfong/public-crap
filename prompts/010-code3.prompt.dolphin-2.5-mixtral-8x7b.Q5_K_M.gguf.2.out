Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

 The intended purpose of this code is to implement a sorting algorithm called "partition" or "quick-select" which is used as part of the quicksort algorithm. It takes an unsorted array "a" and sorts it by choosing a pivot element, dividing the list into two parts: elements smaller than the pivot (l) and elements greater than the pivot (r). Then, it combines these two lists with the pivot in the middle. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

The code has some mistakes and can be improved:
1. If "len(a)" is exactly 1, the function will not return anything because the condition "len(a) <= 1" is satisfied but there is no return statement inside the body of that if-block. We should add a return statement in that case (i.e., `if len(a) == 1: return a`).
2. The list comprehensions for creating the 'l' and 'r' lists are not efficient, especially for large arrays. In Python, using list comprehensions is generally faster than using standard for loops, but in this case, we can further optimize by only iterating through the array once (i.e., no need to iterate again when creating 'r').

Here's a revised version of the code:
```python
def s(a):
    if len(a) == 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l, r = [], []
    for x in a[1:]:
        if x <= p:
            l.append(x)
        else:
            r.append(x)
    return l + [p,] + r
```

Now, here's the implementation of this algorithm in Rust:
```rust
fn s(mut a: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let len = a.len();
    if len == 1 { return a; }
    
    let pivot = a[0];
    let (mut l, mut r) = (vec![], vec![]);
    
    for x in a[1..].iter() {
        if *x <= pivot {
            l.push(*x);
        } else {
            r.push(*x);
        }
    }
    
    return l + [pivot] + r;
}
```
Note that Rust's vector concatenation is slightly different than Python's, which is why we need to create a new vector with the pivot in the middle instead of simply appending it. This function takes a mutable reference to an array, sorts it using the same partition method as the original Python code, and returns the sorted array.
