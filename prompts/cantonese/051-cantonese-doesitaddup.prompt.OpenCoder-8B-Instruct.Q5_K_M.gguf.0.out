I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide an analysis based on the information given. 

The story seems to be about a former colleague who was fired due to disciplinary issues. The person who received the award is said to have been shadowed by this person for a week, and then they were involved in a confrontation with security. The security person reportedly threatened to report the person to the authorities if they didn't leave immediately. The person who received the award then had to confront the security person and ended up being taken away by the higher-ups. The person who received the award also had some issues and was unsure why they were hired in the first place. 

This could be a plausible scenario, but it's hard to say without more context or details. It's also possible that the person who received the award had a different experience or was involved in a different situation. 

In any case, it's important to take this kind of situation seriously and to address the issues that arise as soon as possible.
