I'm skeptical about this story for several reasons:

**Red flags in the narrative:**

1. **Convenient memory** - The commenter claims to remember this person specifically from years ago, which seems suspiciously convenient for someone who's just been awarded.

2. **Vague details** - Very little concrete information is provided (no specific bank names, dates, or verifiable details) making it impossible to fact-check.

3. **Contradictory timeline** - If this person was fired for "stealing from the till" and had such a serious integrity issue, it's questionable how they would pass police vetting, as the commenter themselves note.

4. **Dramatic storytelling** - The narrative reads like tabloid gossip with overly dramatic details (being escorted out by security, threats to call police).

5. **Motivation unclear** - Why would a former colleague who witnessed someone being fired for theft suddenly come forward publicly to质疑their character, especially anonymously?

**Possible explanations:**
- This could be fabricated entirely
- It might be a case of mistaken identity
- The commenter could have ulterior motives (personal grudge, jealousy)
- Or it could be partially true but greatly exaggerated

The story lacks credibility due to its anonymous nature, lack of verifiable details, and convenient timing. I'd need much more substantial evidence to believe it. [end of text]
