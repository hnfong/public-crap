Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Hah.
Yeah. Me too.
I really like to play games.
But I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I never gamble on Big 2 either. ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, huh? What happened?

## Bob:
Went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big 2.
I said, "Let's play."
He said, "1 cent per card..." (because he's very good at it).
I thought, "This guy is so confident." Besides, at most, I'd lose around $10.

## Alice:
That's quite risky.
:)
Hehe. You're really daring.
It's good, actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully.

## Bob:
But it's not good to "stand so hard" (be so stubborn).
Yeah, if gambling is involved, it's very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
What program?
I don't.
I guess I need to download it or something.
:)

## Bob:
Of course, to play online, you need a program to play.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... wait...

## Alice:
How awkward.
:)
No worries.
Hehe. [end of text]
