### Overview of the Situation
The person in the paragraph is a job seeker who is frustrated with the current job market. He is observing that many young and attractive job seekers are struggling to find employment. He mentions that companies are using cash incentives to attract job seekers, but he feels that these incentives are not enough to solve the underlying issues. He acknowledges that he lacks experience and education, which makes it difficult for him to find a job. He also notes that the job market is competitive and that even if he were to find a job, it would likely be low-paying and have poor working conditions. He concludes that the problem is not with the companies but with the job seekers themselves, who lack the necessary qualifications.

### Problems He Has Run Into
1. **Lack of Experience and Education**: The person acknowledges that he does not have the necessary experience or education to be competitive in the job market.
2. **Competitive Job Market**: There are many job seekers, making it difficult to stand out.
3. **Poor Job Conditions**: Even if he were to find a job, it would likely be low-paying and have poor working conditions.
4. **Cash Incentives**: He questions the effectiveness of cash incentives in attracting job seekers.

### Conclusion
The person concludes that the problem is not with the companies but with the job seekers themselves, who lack the necessary qualifications.

### Agreement with Conclusion
I partially agree with his conclusion. It is true that a lack of experience and education can be a significant barrier to employment. However, it is also important to consider the broader economic and social factors that contribute to the job market's competitiveness and the quality of available jobs. Companies and policymakers also have a role to play in creating a more inclusive and supportive job market. Therefore, while individual qualifications are important, they are not the only factor at play.

### Cantonese Translation
佢係一個搵工嘅人，佢覺得而家啲靚仔靚妹都搵唔到工，佢都覺得公司用現金糧去吸引求職者都唔夠。佢自己都冇經驗冇學歷，所以搵工好難。佢覺得即係搵到工，工作條件都唔好，人工都低。佢最終覺得問題唔係出於公司，而係求職者自己冇條件。

我部分同意佢嘅結論。確實，冇經驗冇學歷會影響搵工，但仲有其他經濟同社會因素影響工作市場同工作質素。公司同政策制定者都有責任去創造一個更包容同支持嘅工作市場。所以，個人條件雖然重要，但唔係唯一嘅因素。
