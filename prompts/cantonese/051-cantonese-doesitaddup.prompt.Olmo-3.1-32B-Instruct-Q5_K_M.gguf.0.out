Let me break down and analyze the comment and the story it tells, and then answer whether I "buy" the story.

### Translation and Summary

Here’s a rough translation and summary of the comment:

> I was a colleague of this outstanding police officer, Chen Dak-man, at a certain HSBC bank, where we worked together for a year. Why do I remember him so well? Because when he first joined, in his first week of shadowing me, he messed up by putting something in the wrong drawer at the bottom of the filing cabinet. My boss at the time even warned him, "If you don't leave soon, you'll get reported." But the next afternoon, after I finished lunch and returned to the upper floor, security came and detained him for trying to sneak away. After that, he went on to join the police and became an officer. I think he had some character issues—so I don't know why he passed the vetting process to become a police officer.

### Analysis

#### 1. **Content of the Story**
The commenter is sharing an anecdote from their time working together at a bank. According to the story:
- The future police officer made a mistake (putting something in the wrong place).
- The commenter’s boss warned him.
- Later, the future officer tried to leave work improperly and was caught by security.
- Despite this, he became a police officer after that.

#### 2. **Implication**
The implication is that this person had behavioral or integrity issues at the bank, yet still passed the vetting process to become a police officer.

#### 3. **Credibility of the Story**
- **Anecdotal Evidence:** The story is just that—an anecdote from one person’s perspective. We don’t have evidence to confirm or deny what actually happened.
- **Subjectivity:** The tone is somewhat negative and judgmental. The commenter seems to question how someone with these alleged issues could pass police vetting.
- **Possible Bias:** The commenter may have a personal grudge or bias against the award recipient.
- **Vetting Process:** Police vetting is supposed to be thorough, but no system is perfect. It’s possible for someone to have a youthful indiscretion or workplace issue and still pass vetting if the issue wasn’t reported or was deemed not serious enough.
- **Context Missing:** We don’t know the nature or severity of the “mistake,” nor do we know what the vetting process involved at the time.

#### 4. **Should We "Buy" the Story?**
- **As Fact:** No, we shouldn’t accept the story as definitive fact without more evidence. It’s one person’s account and may not reflect the full picture.
- **As a Cautionary Tale:** It could be a warning about the importance of integrity at every stage of one’s career, but it’s not proof of wrongdoing.
- **As Reflection of Vetting Flaws:** It raises a valid question about the robustness of vetting processes, but one anecdote is not enough to conclude systemic failure.

### Conclusion

**No, I don’t “buy” the story as a definitive judgment of the person’s character or the vetting process.** It’s a single anecdote with possible bias and lacks corroborating evidence. While it raises a reasonable question about how someone with alleged past issues became a police officer, it’s not enough on its own to conclude that there was a failure in the vetting process or that the person is unfit for duty. More context and evidence would be needed to make such a determination.

If you want to use this as a basis for further investigation, you’d need to look into the specifics of the alleged incidents, the police vetting process at the time, and possibly get statements from others involved. Otherwise, it’s best to treat it as just one person’s opinion. [end of text]
