This comment on the forum raises **serious red flags** and is **highly suspicious**, so **I do not buy the story** — and here’s why, with a detailed breakdown:

---

### 🔍 **1. Inconsistencies in the Narrative**
- **"優秀學警陳大文" (Outstanding Police Cadet Chen Dawen)** is being praised for excellence — yet the comment claims he was **fired from a bank job for "failing to meet the bottom of the cash drawer" (衰穿櫃桶底)**, which is a **very serious and unusual reason** for termination.
- **"衰穿櫃桶底"** literally means "failed to cover the cash drawer" — a major accounting discrepancy. This is **not a minor mistake**; it’s a **fraud or theft allegation**, which would normally trigger **immediate police involvement**, not just being escorted out by security.

> ✅ **Reality check**: If someone is caught with a cash shortage (especially if it’s significant), the employer would **not just fire them** — they’d **report it to the police immediately**, especially in a major international bank. The idea that the boss said “if you don’t leave today, I’ll call the police” is **not how real corporate HR works** — it’s a **dramatic exaggeration**.

---

### 🚩 **2. The Timeline is Implausible**
- The comment says:  
  > "佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow"  
  ("He shadowed me in his first week.")
- Then:  
  > "結果下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走"  
  ("After lunch, when I came back, senior management and security came down to escort him out.")

👉 This implies the person was **fired on the same day** — **within hours of starting**.  
But **shadowing** someone for a week is **not typical** for a new hire in a bank. New employees usually go through **training, onboarding, and probation** — not immediate shadowing and immediate firing.

> ❌ **Red flag**: If someone was fired on Day 1, they wouldn’t have had time to shadow anyone. The timeline is **logistically impossible**.

---

### 🧩 **3. The Motive is Suspicious**
- The comment is posted **after** the man received a prestigious police award.
- The tone is **sudden, dramatic, and personal** — claiming to be a former colleague, yet **no name, no company, no date, no evidence**.
- The author says:  
  > "佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關"  
  ("He has some character issues — I don’t know how he passed the vetting process.")

👉 This is **defamation** — a **direct attack on someone’s integrity** after they’ve been publicly honored.  
Why would someone **only now** come forward with such a damaging claim?

> 🔥 **This is classic "revenge" or "slander" behavior** — especially if the person is **jealous, bitter, or has a grudge**.

---

### 🛑 **4. Vetting Process for Police Officers is Rigorous**
- Police vetting in Hong Kong (or any reputable system) includes:
  - Background checks
  - Credit history
  - Criminal record
  - Employment history
  - Interviews with former colleagues
  - Psychological evaluation

> ✅ It’s **extremely unlikely** that someone with a **serious financial misconduct** (like cash drawer failure) would pass vetting — **especially if it involved fraud or theft**.

So the claim that “he passed vetting despite having character issues” is **itself suspicious** — because **if the story were true**, the vetting process would have **already caught it**.

---

### 🧠 Final Verdict: **This story is almost certainly fake or malicious.**

| Point | Why It’s Unbelievable |
|------|------------------------|
| Fired on Day 1 after shadowing | Impossible timeline |
| Cash drawer failure = immediate police report | Not how banks work |
| No evidence or details (name, company, date) | Anonymous, vague |
| Posted only after award | Likely revenge or smear |
| Contradicts vetting process | If true, he wouldn’t have passed |

---

### ✅ What Should You Do?
- **Do not believe this comment.**
- Treat it as **potentially defamatory** or **a troll post**.
- If you’re part of the forum, consider reporting it for **harassment or false information**.
- Remember: **People who are publicly honored are often targeted by jealous or spiteful individuals**.

---

### 📌 Bottom Line:
> ❌ **No, I don’t buy the story.**  
> It’s full of **logical flaws, timeline errors, and malicious intent**.  
> It’s far more likely to be **a smear campaign** than a genuine account.

Stay skeptical — especially when someone’s **reputation is being attacked after a public achievement**. [end of text]
