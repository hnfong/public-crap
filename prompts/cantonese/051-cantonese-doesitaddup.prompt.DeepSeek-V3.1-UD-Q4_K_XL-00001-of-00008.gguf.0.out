This is a comment on a forum about a person who recently received an award for being an outstanding policeman.

"I am a former colleague of this outstanding police officer, Chan Tai Man, from the bank. I worked with him for a year at a major British bank. Why do I remember him so well? Because he followed me during his first week on the job. He was fired for embezzlement (stealing from the till), and the boss at the time said that if he didn't leave immediately, they would call the police. In the afternoon, after I returned from lunch, senior management and security came down to escort him as he packed his things and left. Later, he went on to apply to become a police officer. His character is somewhat questionableâ€”I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

Do you buy the story? Explain.

**Analysis of the Story:**

1. **Source Credibility:** The comment is anonymous and posted on a forum, which lacks verifiable identity or evidence. Forums are prone to rumors, personal grievances, or false claims.

2. **Details Provided:** The story includes specific details (e.g., "Chan Tai Man," "major British bank," "first week shadowing," "embezzlement," "escorted by security"). These details might make it sound plausible, but they are not substantiated with proof (e.g., police report, employment records, or names of others involved).

3. **Motivation:** The poster claims to be a former colleague, but the tone suggests possible malice or jealousy (e.g., questioning how the person passed vetting). Alternatively, it could be a genuine warning, but without evidence, it remains hearsay.

4. **Vetting Process for Police:** Police vetting (background checks) typically includes criminal records, employment history, and character references. If the embezzlement incident occurred and was reported, it should have appeared in checks. However:
   - The employer might not have filed a police report (the boss threatened to but may not have followed through).
   - The incident might not have resulted in a criminal conviction (e.g., internal handling only).
   - Vetting might have missed it if it was not formally recorded.

5. **Plausibility:** It is possible for someone with a past misconduct issue to change or hide their history, but police vetting is designed to catch such issues. Conversely, false accusations or exaggerated stories are also common.

6. **Lack of Corroboration:** No other sources or evidence are provided to support the claim.

**Conclusion:**  
Without evidence, this story should be treated with skepticism. It could be true, but it could also be defamatory. The detailed account might be convincing, but anonymous forum posts are not reliable sources. Police vetting processes are generally rigorous, so if the incident did occur and was properly documented, it should have been detected. However, if it was handled internally without legal action, it might not have appeared in checks.

**Final Answer:**  
I do not fully "buy" the story without evidence. While it is possible that the police officer had a past employment issue, the anonymous and unverified nature of the forum comment makes it unreliable. The detailed account might be intended to damage the officer's reputation. Without proof (e.g., public records of the incident or confirmation from other sources), it should be considered alleged rather than factual. Police vetting processes are designed to screen for such issues, so if the story is true, it might indicate a failure in vetting, but it is equally likely that the story is exaggerated or false.
