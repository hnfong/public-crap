### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph is likely an older individual who has been working since a young age (13 years old) and has encountered difficulties in finding employment. He observes that many young people (referred to as "靚仔靚妹," which translates to "handsome guys and pretty girls") are also struggling to find jobs. He notes that companies are offering cash incentives to attract job seekers, implying a competitive job market. The person feels that his own lack of experience and education makes it difficult for him to secure a job, especially in a market where even those with better qualifications are struggling. He concludes that the problem lies not with the companies' offers but with the job seekers themselves, suggesting that many people lack the necessary qualifications or are unwilling to take on challenging or low-paying jobs.

### Problems Encountered

1. **Lack of Experience and Education**: The person feels that his lack of formal education and work experience makes him less attractive to employers.
2. **Competitive Job Market**: The job market is highly competitive, with many young people also struggling to find employment.
3. **Low Pay and Poor Conditions**: Even when jobs are available, they often come with low pay and poor working conditions, which may deter many job seekers.
4. **Cash Incentives**: Companies are offering cash incentives to attract workers, indicating a shortage of willing employees for certain roles.

### Conclusion

The person concludes that the difficulty in finding employees is not due to insufficient offers from companies but rather because many job seekers have issues such as lack of qualifications or unwillingness to take on challenging or low-paying jobs. He seems to blame the job seekers for the labor shortage rather than considering other systemic issues.

### Agreement with the Conclusion

I do not fully agree with his conclusion. While it is true that a lack of qualifications and unwillingness to take on certain jobs can be factors, the problem is likely more complex. Several other issues could be at play, such as:

1. **Economic Conditions**: The overall economic climate might be affecting job availability and wages.
2. **Industry-Specific Issues**: Certain industries might be facing unique challenges that make it difficult to attract workers.
3. **Skill Mismatch**: There might be a mismatch between the skills job seekers have and the skills employers need.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: Many people might be seeking better work-life balance, which low-paying and demanding jobs may not offer.

In summary, while individual qualifications and attitudes play a role, the problem of finding employees is likely influenced by a combination of economic, industry-specific, and societal factors. [end of text]
