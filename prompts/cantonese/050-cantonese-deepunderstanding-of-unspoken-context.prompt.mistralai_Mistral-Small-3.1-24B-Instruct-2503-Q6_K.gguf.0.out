### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph is an individual who is struggling to find employment. He observes that many young people (referred to as "靚仔靚妹," which translates to "handsome guys and pretty girls") are also having difficulty finding jobs. He notes that companies are offering cash incentives to attract job seekers, which suggests a competitive job market. The person acknowledges several personal challenges:
1. **Lack of Experience**: He has no work experience.
2. **Lack of Education**: He has no formal education or qualifications.
3. **Age**: He started working at the age of 13, indicating a long history of manual labor.

### Problems Encountered

1. **Competitive Job Market**: The job market is highly competitive, with many people vying for the same positions.
2. **Personal Limitations**: His lack of experience and education makes it difficult for him to secure employment.
3. **Company Offerings**: Companies are offering cash incentives to attract workers, which he cannot compete with due to his personal limitations.
4. **Perceived Lack of Choices**: He feels that because of his circumstances, he has no choice but to accept low-paying, undesirable jobs.

### Conclusion

The person concludes that the reason companies are struggling to find employees is not because their offers are insufficient but because there is a fundamental problem with the job seekers themselves. He implies that many people, including himself, have issues that make them unsuitable for employment.

### Agreement with the Conclusion

I do not fully agree with his conclusion. While it is true that personal limitations such as lack of experience and education can be barriers to employment, the problem is more complex. Several factors contribute to the difficulty in finding suitable employees:
1. **Economic Conditions**: The overall economic climate can affect job availability and the types of jobs available.
2. **Industry-Specific Issues**: Certain industries may have specific skill requirements that are in short supply.
3. **Company Policies**: Some companies may have rigid hiring policies that do not accommodate individuals with non-traditional backgrounds.
4. **Social and Educational Systems**: The education system and societal support structures play a significant role in preparing individuals for the job market.

The person's conclusion oversimplifies the issue by placing the blame solely on the job seekers. A more nuanced understanding would consider the interplay of multiple factors, including economic conditions, industry demands, and societal support systems. [end of text]
