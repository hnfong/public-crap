### Overview of the Situation

The person in this paragraph appears to be an older individual, likely someone with significant work experience, possibly from a generation where starting work at a young age (e.g., 13) was more common. The speaker is observing the current job market and expressing frustration with the younger generation's difficulties in finding employment. The main problem he identifies is that young job seekers (referred to as "靚仔靚妹") are struggling to find jobs, particularly those that offer "現金糧" (cash pay). He believes that these young people lack the necessary qualifications (experience and education) to meet the requirements of such jobs.

### Key Problems Identified

1. **Lack of Experience and Education**: The speaker argues that young job seekers lack the necessary experience and qualifications to secure jobs that offer cash pay.
2. **Unrealistic Expectations**: He suggests that these young people have unrealistic expectations about work conditions, such as not wanting jobs that are perceived as "辛苦" (hard work), "污糟" (dirty), or lacking "前景" (prospects).
3. **Market Competition**: The speaker believes that the job market is highly competitive, and without the right qualifications, young people have limited options.

### Conclusion and Agreement

The speaker concludes that the reason companies are having trouble hiring is not because of a lack of job offers, but because young job seekers have "自身條件唔好" (poor personal qualifications) and unrealistic expectations. He believes that if young people were more willing to accept lower-paying, less glamorous jobs, they would have more opportunities.

### My Opinion

While the speaker's perspective is understandable given his background and experience, I don't fully agree with his conclusion. Here's why:

1. **Generational Differences**: The speaker's experience of starting work at a young age and accepting any job may not be directly applicable to the current generation. Young people today face different economic and social realities, including higher education costs, changing job markets, and different expectations about work-life balance.

2. **Complex Job Market**: The job market is not just about qualifications; it also involves factors like economic conditions, industry trends, and the availability of suitable jobs. Blaming young people solely for their inability to find jobs oversimplifies the issue.

3. **Unrealistic Expectations**: While some young people may have unrealistic expectations, it's also important to recognize that many are simply seeking jobs that align with their skills, education, and personal values. The problem is not just about "自身條件唔好," but also about the mismatch between available jobs and the skills and expectations of young job seekers.

In summary, while the speaker's frustration is understandable, his conclusion that the problem lies solely with young job seekers is overly simplistic. The job market is complex, and both structural issues and individual factors contribute to the challenges young people face in finding employment. [end of text]
