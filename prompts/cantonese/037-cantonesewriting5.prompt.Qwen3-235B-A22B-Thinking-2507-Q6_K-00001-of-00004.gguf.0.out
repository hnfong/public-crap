Okay, the user wants me to act as a Cantonese-speaking AI model. They specified that I must use Cantonese grammar and vocabulary, not Mandarin. For example, "的" should be "嘅" and "是" should be "係". 

The main task is to create 10 example sentences using the Cantonese phrase "睇怕", each followed by an English translation. They provided an example with the word "威水" to illustrate the format. 

First, I need to confirm what "睇怕" means. In Cantonese, "睇怕" is a colloquial expression that combines "睇" (to look) and "怕" (to fear). It's often used to describe someone who looks intimidating or scary, or situations that seem daunting. It's not a standard phrase in formal Cantonese, but it's commonly used in informal contexts. 

I should make sure all sentences are natural Cantonese. Common structures might include:
- Subject + 睇怕 + [description]
- Using 睇怕 to describe appearance or situations

Let me brainstorm some scenarios where "睇怕" would be used:
1. Describing a person's scary appearance
2. Talking about a difficult task that looks intimidating
3. Referring to a situation that seems threatening
4. Describing something that looks dangerous
5. Talking about how something appears more difficult than it is

I need to create 10 distinct examples covering different contexts. Each should be a complete sentence in Cantonese with proper grammar, then an accurate English translation.

Important Cantonese elements to include:
- Use "嘅" instead of "的"
- Use "係" instead of "是"
- Use appropriate Cantonese particles like "喇", "㗎", "啫"
- Use Cantonese-specific vocabulary

Let me draft the sentences:

1. 佢塊面黑晒，睇怕到好似要打人咁。 (His face is dark, looking so scary like he's about to hit someone.)
Wait, "睇怕" should be the focus. Maybe: 佢成日板住塊面，睇怕死人。 (He always has a stern face, looks so scary.)

2. 呢份功課題目咁深，睇怕我做唔到。 (This homework is so difficult, I'm afraid I can't do it.)

3. 雨下到咁大，出街睇怕會遇溺。 (It's raining so heavily, going out looks dangerous, might drown.)

4. 個 boss 成日發脾氣，新同事睇怕唔敢同佢講嘢。 (The boss always gets angry, new colleagues are scared to talk to him.)

5. 呢間鬼屋裝修咁恐怖，睇怕到我腳都軟。 (This haunted house is so terrifyingly decorated, it scares me stiff.)

6. 佢揸車揸到咁快，睇怕隨時出車禍。 (He drives so fast, it looks like he might have an accident any moment.)

7. 個醫生面無表情，睇怕到病人唔敢問問題。 (The doctor has no expression, looks so intimidating that patients don't dare to ask questions.)

8. 呢個project dead line咁急，睇怕我哋做唔切。 (This project's deadline is so tight, I'm afraid we won't finish on time.)

9. 電梯壞咗，要行幾十層樓梯，睇怕我腳會斷。 (The elevator is broken, having to walk dozens of flights of stairs, I'm scared my legs will break.)

10. 佢哋班黑社會站喺度，睇怕到路人即刻走開。 (Those gangsters standing there look so scary that passersby immediately walk away.)

Now I need to refine these to make sure they're natural Cantonese and properly use "睇怕". Let me check each one:

1. 佢成日板住塊面，睇怕死人。 - Good, "睇怕死人" is a common phrase meaning "looks extremely scary"

2. 呢份功課題目咁深，睇怕我做唔到。 - This might be better as "睇怕做唔到" without "我", but including "我" is okay for personal fear

3. 雨下到咁大，出街睇怕會遇溺。 - Natural

4. 個 boss 成日發脾氣，新同事睇怕唔敢同佢講嘢。 - Good

5. 呢間鬼屋裝修咁恐怖，睇怕到我腳都軟。 - "睇怕到" is correct usage

6. 佢揸車揸到咁快，睇怕隨時出車禍。 - Good

7. 個醫生面無表情，睇怕到病人唔敢問問題。 - Good

8. 呢個project dead line咁急，睇怕我哋做唔切。 - Using "project" and "dead line" is common in Hong Kong Cantonese

9. 電梯壞咗，要行幾十層樓梯，睇怕我腳會斷。 - Good

10. 佢哋班黑社會站喺度，睇怕到路人即刻走開。 - Good

I should make sure all sentences properly use "睇怕" as the key phrase. In some sentences, it's "睇怕死人" or "睇怕到", which are natural extensions of the phrase.

Let me adjust sentence 2 to be more focused on "睇怕": 呢份功課題目咁深，睇怕做唔到啦。 (This homework is so difficult, looks impossible to complete.)

Also need to ensure translations accurately reflect the Cantonese meaning, not just word-for-word.

Final check for Cantonese authenticity:
- Using "咁" instead of "很"
- Using "佢" instead of "他"
- Using "嘅" for possessive
- Using appropriate sentence endings

Okay, these should work. Now I'll format them exactly as requested with numbering and translations.
