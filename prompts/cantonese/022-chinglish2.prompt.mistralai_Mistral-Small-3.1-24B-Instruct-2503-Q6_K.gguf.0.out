Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I like to play games a lot.
But I never gamble.

## Bob:
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either.
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago? What happened?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
I said okay, let's play.
He said it's 1 cent per card (because he plays very well).
I thought, "So what," and besides, at most I would lose something like $10.

## Alice:
Okay, fine.
Hehe. But if you have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
But it's not good to be too strict about it...
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
What program?
I don't have it.
You need to download it or something.

## Bob:
To play online, you need a program to play.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP. Wait...

## Alice:
Okay.
Hehe, no problem. [end of text]
