 [/INST] The paragraph describes a situation where the person is facing difficulties finding a job. The individual feels that companies require job seekers to have cash allowances, but they do not meet those requirements due to their lack of experience and education. They question why companies would use cash allowances to attract job seekers when they themselves are not qualified. They also mention their young age and willingness to work despite the difficulties they face. The person concludes that the reason they cannot find a job is not because of low company offers, but because of their own limitations and issues.

In summary, the person is a young job seeker facing difficulties finding employment due to their lack of experience and education. They question the use of cash allowances as a means of attracting job seekers and express frustration at their own limitations.

I agree with the person's conclusion that their own limitations are a significant factor in their difficulty finding a job. However, it is important to note that the job market is highly competitive, and experience and education are often important factors that employers consider. While the person's age and willingness to work are positive attributes, they may need to focus on gaining more experience and education to increase their chances of finding employment. Additionally, it may be helpful to explore alternative job search strategies and expand their network to increase their opportunities. [end of text]
