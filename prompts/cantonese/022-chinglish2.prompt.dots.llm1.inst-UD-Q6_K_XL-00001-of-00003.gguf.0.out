Here’s a simple English translation of the conversation:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play gah (a card game), but I never gamble, lol.  

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don’t gamble big either.  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, with Joe Mud?  

**Bob:**  
Went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play big2 (a card game).  
I said let’s play.  
Then he said 1 cent per card (because he’s good at it).  
So I thought, “Whatever, it’s just ‘so hing’ (a small bet).” Besides, at most, I’d lose like $10.  

**Alice:**  
Oh, that’s it.  
Haha. You’re quite the gambler, huh?  
It’s good actually, but if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game fully.  

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “stand so hard” (bet too much).  
Yeah, gambling is very stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
What program?  
No.  
Do I need to download something?  
(Lol)  

**Bob:**  
Of course you need a program to play online.  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... wait...  

**Alice:**  
Oh, okay.  
Thanks.  
Haha.

### Notes:  
- **"Gah" and "big2"** are likely card games (e.g., Big Two, a popular Asian game).  
- **"So hing"** and **"stand so hard"** are casual terms for betting or gambling.  
- **"Lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai"** ≈ "You’re quite the gambler, huh?" (playful tone).  
- **"Ngor juun hai yiu gamble"** ≈ "If I had to gamble."  
- **"Moe"** ≈ "No" (Cantonese slang).  
- **"Hoe ark"** ≈ "Oh, okay."  

The conversation is lighthearted, with Alice and Bob discussing gambling (or avoiding it) and a card game program. Let me know if you'd like further clarification! [end of text]
