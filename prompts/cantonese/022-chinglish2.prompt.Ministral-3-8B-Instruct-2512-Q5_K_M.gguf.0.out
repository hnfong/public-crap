Here’s a simplified and more natural translation of the conversation into English:

---

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like playing [Mahjong] a lot.
But I never gamble, okay? :)

**Bob:**
Oh... I don’t gamble on [Mahjong] either. ;-)
Except for that one time a few weeks ago...

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago, Joe invited you?

**Bob:**
Yeah, I went to a friend’s house.
He wanted to play [Mahjong].
I said, “Let’s play,” but he said it was 1 cent per card (because he’s really good).
I thought, “Okay, fine...” Besides, I’d lose at most like $10 anyway...

**Alice:**
Haha, you’re joking, right? :)
Hehe. Actually, it’s fun. But if you *really* gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**
But it’s not good to be so stubborn about it, you know?
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful...
Oh, by the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
The program?
Yeah, I do.
You can download it or something, okay? :)

**Bob:**
Oh, I can’t play online because I need a program to play.
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...

**Alice:**
Okay, I’ll figure it out.
Haha, no worries.
Hehe.
