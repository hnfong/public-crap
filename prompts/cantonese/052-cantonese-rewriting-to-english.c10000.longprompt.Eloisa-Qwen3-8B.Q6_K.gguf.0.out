Okay, the user wants me to rewrite a Chinese essay into English without translating individual words or phrases, and then comment on the essay's main point while disregarding the sarcastic tone. Let me start by understanding the essay's content.

The essay is about Yu Ying-shih, a professor who was mourned by Professor Wang Wei-xiong. The author initially knew little about Yu but researched him using Google, discovering his prominence and Wang's admiration. The author compares Yu to Yun Guo-ren, a respected figure, noting similarities in their traditional Chinese scholarship. However, the author criticizes the adaptation of Confucianism in the West, especially in American academia, where it's reinterpreted to fit democratic values. The essay sarcastically mocks how Confucian ideas are twisted to support Western ideologies, using historical examples like Confucius's failures and the evolution of Confucian thought in different regions.

Now, I need to rewrite this in English. I'll maintain the structure and flow, ensuring the sarcasm and critical tone are preserved. Then, for the commentary, I should identify the main argument: the author argues that Confucianism, when transplanted to the West, is distorted to align with Western democratic values, losing its original essence. The sarcastic tone is used to highlight this critique, but the core message is about the misappropriation of Confucian ideas in Western academia.

I should check if the rewrite accurately captures the nuances and sarcasm. Also, in the commentary, I need to clearly state the main point without getting bogged down by the sarcastic elements. The user might be interested in understanding the author's perspective on cultural adaptation and academic integrity, so emphasizing that would be key.

**Rewritten Essay:**

Three hours ago, after finishing work and returning home to browse the internet, I came across tributes to #Yu Ying-shih. At the time, I only knew he was a role model for Professor #Wang Wei-xiong, a blogger, and had no other knowledge of his life. However, in the 21st century, there's no need to constantly consult teachers; with Google, one can learn about anything in the world. After some research, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wang admired him so much. Yu had been a professor at three Ivy League universities! How impressive is that! Just the thought of it sends chills down my spine!  

I became like a stalker, digging up every bit of background information on Yu Ying-shih: how the Chinese Wikipedia described him, how the English Wikipedia described him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how today’s obituaries portrayed him. My mind conjured up the image of the most respected person I know—Master Yun Guo-ren. It was uncanny! Unfortunately, Master Yun didn’t hold a professorship at Harvard, but his #knowledgeable-in-all-eras and #loyalty-to-China traditional Chinese scholarship must have been of the same caliber. Master Yun loved Daoism and Buddhism, while Yu seemed to be a fan of Confucianism.  

But that’s a problem.  

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness, along with hierarchical order and the duties of rulers and subjects. However, if you’re studying for a PhD at a top American university during the era when hippies were at their peak, you probably won’t be told to #respect teachers and avoid #individualism. That would be a disaster.  

Speaking of scholars avoiding such pitfalls, it’s the bitter lesson that Confucius spent his lifetime to acquire. His students, followers of Confucianism, couldn’t possibly ignore it: During Confucius’s time, the world was on the brink of chaos. He traveled from state to state, hoping to secure a position to accomplish great deeds. But he could only recite the rites of King Wu and couldn’t adapt to the needs of his superiors, ultimately returning home without success. However, failure is the mother of success, and his students advanced much further. Sima Qian wrote: “The seventy disciples of Confucius wandered among the feudal lords, some becoming teachers, ministers, and high officials, while others became friends and mentors to scholars and officials.” Why was that?  

Because, after several generations of transmission, they began to understand the subtleties of the monarch’s expressions. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with the king were different—he spoke with wit and humor, knowing how to flatter his superiors. For example, he told King Qi: “I see that you don’t even kill a cow, so you must be a benevolent ruler! If you follow the Way of the King, you will succeed!”  

By the late Warring States period, the “Confucians” who served as advisors to the kings had mastered the art of “interviewing the monarch” to an extraordinary degree. To secure official positions, they abandoned “benevolence” and “propriety,” focusing instead on studying “legalism,” a new technology. Thus, Xunzi, a Confucian scholar, trained students who could hold high-ranking positions in the Qin dynasty. You can’t smell a single trace of Confucius’s spirit in Li Si.  

Today, with over a hundred countries in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than during the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian disciples, leaving their ancient land of etiquette, China, to settle in the barbaric, militaristic United States, would they really preach #filial piety and #mourning for three years? Confucius and his disciples were once turned away from doors, a story well-known to all. Therefore, in the United States, Confucian disciples must surely say that Confucius supported #democracy, that #democracy is great, and that the Communist Party is doomed, which is why Ivy League professors are so prominent!  

Some might ask: What’s the harm in that? There’s none! Confucius and Mencius died two thousand years ago, and the Confucian tradition was smashed during the #May Fourth Movement. As the sole superpower after WWII, the academic authorities of top American universities could, if they wanted, promote Johnny Kung as a drug user and womanizer, and people might still believe it. After all, America’s #theoretical nuclear weapons are solid, and the consequences of Japan’s disbelief are still fresh in our minds.  

So why could Yu Ying-shih, with just a few sentences from the *Book of Han*, earn a PhD and be invited to teach at several universities? #You know what I mean. Promote him to a godlike authority, and he’d boldly declare: “Everyone here is a duck, thinking that Confucius’s ideas are feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, he was a democratic fighter! If you don’t have a teaching post, just listen to the book!”  

As for whether Confucianism conflicts with democracy? Honestly, these matters, the “Sinologists” know better. Take the Republic of China as an example. Wait, sir, isn’t Taiwan’s political system “Confucian”? The Kuomintang, every day, mocks Tsai Ing-wen. Is that how Confucianism is played? Has Tsai Ing-wen performed the rites of heaven and earth? No, she hasn’t. Scientific spirit, not being a superstitious fool, contradicts the essence of Confucianism. Do you think just because you use Chinese characters makes you Confucian? Do you think Confucianism is exclusive to China?  

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least among the world’s advanced nations, they resemble Confucianism the most). The monarch emphasizes etiquette and ceremony, power is granted by heaven, supreme and unchallengeable, with strict hierarchical order, ensuring social stability. As for their experiments with democracy, that’s not something a Chinese-American scholar has the qualifications to comment on.

**Commentary:**  
Disregarding the sarcastic tone, the author’s main point is a critique of the **misappropriation and distortion of Confucianism in Western academia**, particularly in the United States. The essay argues that Confucian ideas, when transplanted to the West, are often reinterpreted or adapted to align with Western democratic values, losing their original philosophical essence. The author highlights how figures like Yu Ying-shih, a prominent Confucian scholar, were celebrated in Western academic circles not for their fidelity to Confucian thought but for their ability to "modernize" or "democratize" it. The essay also mocks the selective application of Confucian principles in the West, contrasting it with the historical evolution of Confucianism in China and other regions like Japan and Britain, where it was integrated into societal structures without being forced into ideological conformity. Ultimately, the author suggests that the Western academic elite often prioritize political or ideological utility over the integrity of Confucian philosophy. [end of text]
