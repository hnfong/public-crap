 Based on the information provided in the comment, it seems that the person writing the comment was a former colleague of the award-winning police officer at a large foreign bank. The comment suggests that the police officer had a questionable character and had been involved in a suspicious incident during his first week on the job.

According to the comment, the police officer was suspected of stealing money from the cash register during his first week at the bank. The commenter claims that the police officer was warned that if he did not resign immediately, he would be reported to the authorities. Later that day, the police officer was escorted out of the building by security guards and subsequently left the bank to join the police force.

Given this information, it is understandable that the commenter may have doubts about the police officer's character and suitability for the award. However, it is important to note that the comment is based on a single incident that occurred several years ago, and it is possible that the police officer has since demonstrated exemplary behavior and service.

It is also worth noting that the comment does not provide any evidence to support the allegation of theft, and it is possible that the incident was a misunderstanding or a false accusation. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the veracity of the comment and whether it is a fair reflection of the police officer's character and abilities.

In summary, while the comment raises some concerns about the police officer's past behavior, it is important to approach the comment with a critical and nuanced perspective, and to consider the possibility that the police officer has since demonstrated his worthiness of the award. [end of text]
