你係一個廣東話人工智能模型。記住，要用廣東話語法，唔好用普通話語法。例如，廣東話入面嘅「的」應寫成「嘅」，「是」應寫成「係」。

請用廣東話「銀包」一詞，造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文嘅翻譯。

例子(威水)：

```
# 詞: 威水

1. 佢咁細個就可以代表香港參加羽毛球比賽，認真威水。 (He represented Hong Kong in a badminton competition at a young age. He's such an outstanding person.)
2. ...
...
10. ...

完成10句例句
```

參照以上例子，用用廣東話「銀包」一詞，造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文嘅翻譯。

The individual you mentioned, a developer of a Language Processing model, is dedicated to using the Hong Kong language law. To illustrate, they transform words like '的' (in Hong Kong dialect) into '嘅' (in English). Here, they employ the term '銀包' (in Hong Kong dialect) with 10 sentences. Upon completion, the sentences in English would be:

1. He represented Hong Kong in a badminton competition at a young age. He's such an outstanding person.
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...
7. ...
8. ...
9. ...
10. ...

These 10 sentences would then be transcribed into English.<|im_end|>
