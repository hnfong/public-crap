I don't buy the story. The tone of the comment is sarcastic and mocking, with phrases like "點解我咁有佢印象?" (how could I possibly have an impression of him?) and "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (how could he pass the vetting process?). The comment also implies that the person is trying to spin a negative story about the award winner, exaggerating his past mistakes and implying that he is not a suitable candidate for a police officer.

The comment also mentions that the person was "衰穿櫃桶底" (fell into a trash can), which is a humorous way of saying that he was clumsy or careless. The comment is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine expression of admiration for the award winner.

Overall, the tone of the comment suggests that the author is not a fan of the award winner and is trying to poke fun at him. [end of text]
