The person in this situation is a young man named "Mei-yin" (麗賢) who is currently working at a company. He is facing a problem where he believes that the company needs to use "money money" (金金) to attract job seekers and help them get jobs. He thinks that his own skills and qualifications align with the company's needs. He also feels that he should be able to express his thoughts and concerns to the company's higher-ups.

Mei-yin is in a dilemma because he feels that the company's current situation is not favorable for job seekers, and he believes that the company should offer more support and opportunities for job seekers. He is also concerned about the company's reputation and wants to make sure that the company is doing the right thing.

In my opinion, I agree with Mei-yin's conclusion. It is essential for companies to support job seekers and create a positive work environment. Companies should not only focus on their own success but also consider the well-being of their employees and job seekers. By offering support and opportunities, companies can attract and retain talented individuals, which can ultimately benefit the company's success.

Moreover, companies should also be open to feedback and concerns from their employees and job seekers. This can help companies improve their policies and practices, which can lead to a more positive work environment and better job opportunities for job seekers.

In conclusion, Mei-yin's concerns and suggestions are valid, and companies should take them into consideration to create a more supportive and positive work environment for job seekers.
