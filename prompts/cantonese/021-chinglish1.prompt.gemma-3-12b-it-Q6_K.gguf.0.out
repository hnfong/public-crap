Okay, here are the translations of the Chinglish phrases into standard Cantonese, along with explanations to show the thought process.  I'll try to capture the original Chinglish flavor as much as possible while making it grammatically correct Cantonese.  Note that Cantonese has a lot of regional variations, so there might be slightly different ways to say these things depending on where in Hong Kong you are.

**1. gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah**
=> **個朵有冇been睇到啊？** (go3 dou6 jau5 mou5 been2 tai2 dou3 a3?)
*   **Explanation:** "Doe" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "door."  Here, it's used to mean "thing" or "item." "Bin" is a direct borrowing of the English word "been." "Tai lo" means "see/watch." The whole phrase is asking "Did you see that thing/item?"

**2. ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?**
=> **我呢個識用飛機，用去講啲我嘅嘢？** (ngor5 ni1 go3 sik1 jung6 fei1 gei1, jung6 heoi3 gong2 di1 ngor5 ge3 je5?)
*   **Explanation:** "Ngor" is "I/me." "Sik use" is a Chinglish way of saying "know how to use." "Fai zi gah" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "flying machine," referring to an airplane. "Chi gang duck ng duck" is a Chinglish way of saying "use to talk about my things." The whole phrase is asking "I know how to use airplanes, can I use it to talk about my things?" (likely a nonsensical or humorous statement).

**3. mud yeah lei ga?**
=> **乜嘢你講啊？** (mat1 je5 nei5 gong2 a3?)
*   **Explanation:** "Mud" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "what." "Yeah" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "you." "Lei ga" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "say." The whole phrase is asking "What are you saying?"

**4. but yuu yat chai yum cha lah**
=> **不過有啲點心啦** (bat1 gu2 jau5 di1 dim2 sam1 laa1)
*   **Explanation:** "But" is a direct borrowing of the English word. "Yuu yat chai" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "have some." "Yum cha" is the Cantonese term for "dim sum." "Lah" is a common Cantonese particle used for emphasis or softening a statement. The whole phrase is saying "But let's have some dim sum."

**5. gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu**
=> **個password send咗俾你個Yahoo email 囉** (go3 password send3 zo2 bei2 nei5 go3 Yahoo email lu1 lo1)
*   **Explanation:** "Gor" means "the." "Password" is a direct borrowing. "Send jor" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "sent to." "Hui" means "give." "Yahoo email" is a direct borrowing. "Lu" is a particle indicating certainty or assumption. The whole phrase is saying "The password has been sent to your Yahoo email."

**6. farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga**
=> **番學乎算數啦，幾時算放假㗎** (farn1 hok6 fu1 syun3 sou3 laa1, gei2 si4 syun3 fong3 ga3)
*   **Explanation:** "Farn hok" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "go back to school." "Ho sun fu" is a Chinglish pronunciation of "calculate." "Lor" is a particle used for emphasis. "Gei si" means "when." "Sin fong ga" means "holiday." The whole phrase is saying "Go back to school to calculate, when will it be a holiday?"

**7. yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok...**

The whole phrase is saying "Food, bad food, like that boy." (likely a nonsensical or humorous statement).
