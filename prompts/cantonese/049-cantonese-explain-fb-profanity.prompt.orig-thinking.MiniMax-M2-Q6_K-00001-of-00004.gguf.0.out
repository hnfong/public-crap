I need to read the text and answer the questions. The text is in Cantonese with profanity, so I’ll summarize it in a neutral way. The author seems to be a frustrated concertgoer who is upset about the audience's reaction and the band's behavior. They’re angry about the encore and the lack of respect for the performance. I’ll also note the注意事项 for attending live shows, like not shouting "encore" before the song ends and respecting the performers.

I need to provide a polite rewrite of the text, focusing on the original meaning while removing profanity. The text expresses frustration about the audience's reaction and the band's behavior.

### (0) 簡略解釋
作者在描述一場演唱會的體驗：舞台燈光從白轉粉紅、拍手與錄影都在預期之內，但覺得觀眾反應過度、缺乏判斷力；尤其對有人在中途就喊「encore」感到憤怒，認為這是對演出不尊重。作者因此對香港的現場演出環境失望，寧可回去聽錄音。
