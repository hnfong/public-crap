## Alice:  
hah.  
yeah, same here.  
I really like playing, hah.  
but I never gamble, okay?  
:)

## Bob:  
oh really... I don’t gamble on Big2 either ;-)  
except that one time a few weeks ago  

## Alice:  
a few weeks ago? Joe was there?  

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, right?  
So I said fine, let’s play.  
He said 1 cent per card... (because he’s really good)  
I thought, “How scary,” but still, I could lose at most like $10, right?  

## Alice:  
haha, true.  
:)  
hehe. You’re lucky it wasn’t serious.  
Actually, it’s okay. But if we have to gamble, I can’t enjoy the game fully.  

## Bob:  
But it’s not fun to be so strict either…  
Yeah, if there’s gambling, it gets too stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:  
No program.  
Nope.  
I haven’t downloaded it or anything.  
:)  

## Bob:  
Well, to play online, you need the program, right?  
My chat client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe I can send it to you via ftp or http… Wait…  

## Alice:  
Okay then.  
:)  
You tell me.  
hehe [end of text]
