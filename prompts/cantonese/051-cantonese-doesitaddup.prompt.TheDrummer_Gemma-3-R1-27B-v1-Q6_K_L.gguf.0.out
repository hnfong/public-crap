Okay, let's break down this forum comment and assess its credibility. Here's a translation and then a detailed analysis of why someone might or might not believe it:

**Translation:**

"I was a former colleague of this outstanding young police officer, Chen Da Wen, at a British bank. Why do I remember him so vividly? Because he shadowed me for his first week on the job. He was fired for stealing from the cash drawers (literally 'bottom of the counter' - meaning petty cash). The boss even said if he didn't leave immediately, they'd call the police. In the afternoon, after I finished lunch and returned, senior management and security came down to escort him out while he packed his things. After that, he ended up becoming a police officer. His character is questionable; I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

**Do I buy the story?  Probably not entirely, or at least with *significant* skepticism.** Here's a breakdown of why, looking at both the plausibility of the events and the motivations of the commenter:

**Reasons to Doubt (Red Flags):**

1. **Specificity that feels *too* detailed:** The commenter provides very specific details:
   *   "Shadowed me for the first week."
   *   "Stealing from the cash drawers."
   *   "Boss said if he didn't leave immediately, they'd call the police."
   *   "Senior management and security escorted him out after lunch."
   *   "He ended up becoming a police officer."
   *   "His character is questionable; I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

    While details can add credibility, this level of specificity, especially about a relatively minor incident (petty theft) from years ago, feels almost *too* perfect.  It's the kind of detail someone might invent to make a story sound authentic.  The exact phrasing ("bottom of the counter") and the boss's threat are particularly vivid and dramatic.

2. **The "Outstanding Policeman" Award Context:** The commenter is clearly reacting to Chen Da Wen receiving an award. This is *crucial*. The timing and the award are the primary motivation for posting this now.  It strongly suggests the commenter is motivated by:
   *   **Disbelief/Outrage:** "How could *this* person get an award?"
   *   **Malice/Spite:**  A desire to discredit Chen Da Wen.
   *   **Jealousy:**  Less likely, but possible.

3. **The Vetting Question:** The final sentence ("His character is questionable; I don't know how he passed the vetting process") is a classic rhetorical device. It's not just stating a fact; it's implying corruption or incompetence in the police vetting system. It's designed to cast doubt on Chen Da Wen's entire career.

4. **Petty Theft and Police Vetting:** While not impossible, it's *highly* unusual for someone fired for petty theft (especially if it was a single incident and not part of a pattern) to be completely barred from becoming a police officer. Vetting processes are thorough, but they usually focus on serious criminal behavior, dishonesty in applications, or patterns of misconduct. A single, relatively minor theft incident, especially if it happened years ago, might be disclosed and investigated, but it wouldn't necessarily be an automatic disqualifier.  The commenter's surprise at him passing vetting feels exaggerated.

5. **The Shadowing Detail:** The fact that Chen Da Wen shadowed the commenter for his first week is a bit odd.  In most large organizations, new hires have structured training programs, not just shadowing one colleague.  It's not impossible, but it adds to the feeling that the commenter is trying to establish a personal connection to make the story more believable.

**Reasons Why It *Could* Be True (But Less Likely):**

1. **Bank Security is Serious:** Banks take theft very seriously, even small amounts.  Escorting someone out with security present is plausible, especially if the boss made a threat.
2. **Dishonesty is a Red Flag:** Dishonesty (even about theft) *is* a major concern for police vetting.  If Chen Da Wen lied about this on his application, that would be grounds for disqualification.  However, the commenter doesn't say he lied; they just say the vetting process is questionable.
3. **Vetting Isn't Perfect:** Vetting processes can sometimes miss things, especially if the incident wasn't properly documented or if the applicant was clever at concealing it.

**Conclusion:**

**I strongly suspect this comment is either partially fabricated or heavily embellished.** The level of specific detail, the timing in relation to the award, the dramatic phrasing, and the incredulous tone all point to a disgruntled former colleague trying to discredit Chen Da Wen.

**What's most likely:**

*   There *may* have been an incident at the bank involving Chen Da Wen. Perhaps a minor issue with cash handling or a misunderstanding.
*   The commenter has likely exaggerated the severity of the incident ("stealing from the cash drawers" sounds worse than "a small discrepancy in the till") and the drama surrounding his departure.
*   The commenter is using this incident to question Chen Da Wen's character and the integrity of the police vetting process.

**Without corroborating evidence, I would take this comment with a *very* large grain of salt.** It's classic internet forum behavior: someone with a grudge using anonymity to attack someone else.  The commenter's motivation is clearly not to provide objective information but to damage Chen Da Wen's reputation.



**Important Note:**  This analysis is based solely on the text of the comment. It's impossible to know the truth without further investigation. However, the commenter's language and the context strongly suggest bias and a lack of objectivity. [end of text]
