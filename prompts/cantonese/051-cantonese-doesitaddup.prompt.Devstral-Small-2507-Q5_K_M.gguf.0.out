The story shared on the forum is quite detailed and provides specific incidents that the narrator claims to have witnessed. Here are some points to consider when evaluating the credibility of the story:

1. **Specific Details**: The narrator provides specific details about the events, such as the incident involving the "衰穿櫃桶底" (wearing a torn suit) and the subsequent actions taken by the supervisor and security. These details can make the story seem more credible.

2. **Personal Experience**: The narrator claims to have worked with the person in question and to have directly witnessed the events described. This personal experience can add weight to the story.

3. **Consistency**: The story is consistent in its narrative, from the initial incident to the person's eventual decision to become a police officer. This consistency can make the story seem more plausible.

4. **Motivation**: The narrator does not seem to have a clear motive to fabricate the story. There is no indication of personal gain or malice towards the person mentioned.

5. **Vetting Process**: The narrator questions how the person passed the vetting process for becoming a police officer, given the alleged incidents. This raises a valid point, as the vetting process is typically rigorous and designed to weed out individuals with significant character flaws.

However, there are also some points to consider that might raise doubts:

1. **Anonymity**: The story is posted anonymously, which can make it harder to verify the claims. Anonymous posts can sometimes be less reliable because there is no accountability.

2. **Lack of Independent Verification**: There is no independent verification of the events described. Without additional sources or witnesses, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the story.

3. **Potential Bias**: The narrator's perception of the events might be biased. People often have different interpretations of the same events, and the narrator's version might not be entirely objective.

4. **Unusual Behavior**: The behavior described, such as wearing a torn suit to work and being escorted out by security, is quite unusual and might raise questions about the narrator's memory or the accuracy of the events.

In conclusion, while the story is detailed and provides specific incidents, the lack of independent verification and the potential for bias or memory errors make it difficult to fully buy the story without further evidence. It is always important to approach such stories with a critical eye and consider multiple perspectives. [end of text]
