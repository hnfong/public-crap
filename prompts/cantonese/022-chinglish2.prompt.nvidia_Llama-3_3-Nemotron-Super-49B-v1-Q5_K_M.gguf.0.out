- **but never gamble lor** :)  
  *Simple English:* but I never gamble though :) (lor is used to soften the statement, similar to "you know" or "I mean").  
- **:)**  
  *Simple English:* (Smiling face, indicating the statement is not too serious)

### **Bob**
- **orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)**  
  *Simple English:* Oh well... I also never gamble when playing Big2 ;-) (Big2 is a card game; ;-) is a winking face, indicating a joke or lightheartedness).

  *Simple English:* Except for that one time a few weeks ago  

### **Alice**
- **a few weeks ago joe mud ah?**

  *Simple English:* I went to a friend's house  
- **he wanted to play big2 wor**  
  *Simple English:* He wanted to play Big2 (wor is used to seek agreement or confirmation, similar to "you see" or "right?").  
- **gum i say play lor**  
  *Simple English:* Then I said, "Let's play" (gum is a casual way of saying "then" or "so"; lor softens the statement).  
- **gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)**  
  *Simple English:* Then he said, "1 cent per card..." (because he plays very well) (gum again indicates a sequence of events).  
- **gum I fai si "so hing" la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh...**  
  *Simple English:* Then I thought, "Whatever" (so hing is a casual way of expressing resignation or acceptance; la is used to end a sentence in an informal tone). Besides, I could lose at most something like $10, right? (jeh seeks agreement).  

### **Alice**
- **gum yau hai** :)  
  *Simple English:* Then that's how it is :) (expressing acceptance or "that's life").  
- **hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai**  
  *Simple English:* Hehe. It's good actually. (lei gor = actually, yuun doe = it's, gei moe = very, sor wai = good).  
- **it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor**  
  *Simple English:* (Repeated for clarity in English) It's good actually. But if I had to gamble seriously, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly (ngor juun hai yiu = seriously, lor softens the statement).  

### **Bob**
- **but it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...**  
  *Simple English:* But it's not very good to be so stubborn... (stand so hard is a direct translation of a phrase implying being overly stubborn or rigid; ga is used for emphasis or to seek agreement).  
- **yea if need to gamble it's very stressful...**  
  *Simple English:* Yeah, if one has to gamble, it's very stressful...  
- **btw, do u have the program?**  
  *Simple English:* By the way, do you have the program? (btw = by the way, u = you).  

### **Alice**
- **meh program.**  
  *Simple English:* What program? (meh is used to ask for clarification, similar to "which one" or "what do you mean by").  
- **moe**  
  *Simple English:* None / I don't know (contextually, it seems to imply she doesn't have it or doesn't know which one Bob refers to).  
- **hai ng hai yiu download or sth** :)  
  *Simple English:* Just download it or something :) (hai ng hai yiu = just, sth = something).  

### **Bob**
- **gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la...**  
  *Simple English:* Then, of course, to play online, you need a program to play (ga emphasizes the obviousness, la is informal).  
- **my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...**  
  *Simple English:* My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... Wait... (u = you).
