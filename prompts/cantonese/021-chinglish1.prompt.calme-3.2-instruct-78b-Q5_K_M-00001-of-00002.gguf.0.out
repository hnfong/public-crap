Please note that Chinglish to Cantonese translation can be quite subjective due to the non-standard nature of Chinglish and the fact that Cantonese is often spoken rather than written, leading to variations in romanization and interpretation. The provided translations are based on the most common interpretations and may not be 100% accurate. For instance, "need boot" in 9 could be a literal translation or a term that requires context to be properly translated. Similarly, "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai" in 10 might not be a coherent phrase in Cantonese, as it appears to be a direct romanization of a phrase that might not have a direct translation.
