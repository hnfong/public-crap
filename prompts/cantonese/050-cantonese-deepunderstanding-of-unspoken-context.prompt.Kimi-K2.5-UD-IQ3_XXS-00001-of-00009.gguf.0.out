The user wants me to critique a paragraph in Cantonese. The paragraph is a rant about young people complaining they can't find jobs, but the author argues they are too picky (wanting cash-in-hand wages, complaining about hard/dirty work, low pay, no prospects) whereas the author himself started working at 13 and didn't mind these conditions.

 I need to:
 1. Give an overview of the objective situation (who is he, his overall situation, what problems he encountered and why)
 2. Discuss whether I agree with his conclusion

 I can answer in English or Cantonese. Since the source text is Cantonese, I should probably respond in Cantonese or English. I'll provide a balanced analysis.

 Analysis of the text:
 - Speaker: An older man ("阿叔") who started working at 13
 - His situation: Has work experience since young age, likely from working class background, had to take whatever job available
 - Problem he identifies: Young people today complain about not finding jobs but are too selective (want cash wages, complain about hard/dirty/low-paying work with no prospects)
 - His argument: When you have no experience/education, you have no choice. Companies use cash wages to attract people because... (implied: tax evasion or targeting those who can't get regular jobs). He concludes the problem isn't with companies/offers but with the people themselves.

 Objective situation breakdown:
 - He is an older worker (likely Gen X or older) with a "bootstrap" mentality
 - He started working at 13 (child labor, likely due to poverty/family need)
 - He sees young people today as entitled/picky compared to his generation
 - The economic context has changed significantly since he was young (different labor market, education expectations, cost of living)

 Critique of his conclusion:
 - His conclusion is overly simplistic and ignores structural economic changes
 - "Cash wages" often indicate informal/illegal employment (tax evasion, lack of labor protections)
 - Working conditions and labor rights have evolved; expecting modern workers to accept child labor conditions is unreasonable
 - The labor market is different now (credential inflation, automation, gig economy)
 - Survivorship bias: he made it, but many in his generation also struggled
 - Confuses "no choice" due to poverty with a virtue

 I should be respectful but critical of his bootstrap narrative and point out the flaws in comparing 2020s job market with his childhood experiences.

 Structure:
 1. Overview (objective situation)
 2. Analysis of his perspective
 3. Evaluation of his conclusion (agree/disagree with reasoning)

 I'll write in English for clarity but could do Cantonese. The user said either is fine. I'll do English with some Cantonese terms for precision, or fully Cantonese. Given the academic nature of the critique, English might be clearer, but Cantonese shows cultural understanding. I'll do English as it's safer for nuanced critique.

 Wait, the user might prefer Cantonese since the source is Cantonese. But English is fine too. I'll provide a comprehensive response in English with clear sections.

 Key points to address:
 - He is likely a working-class older male who entered workforce young (13)
 - He faced structural disadvantages (no education) and had to accept poor conditions
 - He views modern youth as entitled for wanting cash wages (which actually indicate informal economy/tax evasion) and rejecting hard/dirty work
 - His conclusion: hiring shortage is due to workers being problematic, not employers

 Why his conclusion is flawed:
 - Cash wages = under the table = illegal/unprotected
 - Labor standards have improved (child labor laws, safety regs)
 - Credential inflation: jobs that didn't require degrees now do
 - Cost of living vs wages: his 13-year-old income probably went further relative to expenses, or family supported him
 - Survivorship bias
 - Different economic structure now (manufacturing vs service/knowledge economy)

 Let me draft the response.**Overview of the Objective Situation**

The speaker presents himself as an older working-class man (indicated by the self-referential 「阿叔」) who entered the workforce at age 13, likely due to economic necessity rather than choice. His background suggests he grew up in poverty or working-class circumstances where child labor was a survival requirement, not a career option. He has apparently survived decades of manual or low-status labor ("辛苦污糟冇前景人工低") and developed a high tolerance for exploitation, which he frames as resilience.

The "problem" he identifies is a labor market mismatch: he observes young jobseekers today complaining about unemployment while allegedly rejecting available work. Specifically, he notes their desire for "現金糧" (cash-in-hand wages, often indicating informal/under-the-table employment that bypasses taxation and labor protections) and their complaints about working conditions (hardship, dirtiness, low pay, lack of prospects). He interprets this not as rational discernment but as generational entitlement.

**Critique of His Conclusion**

I fundamentally disagree with his conclusion that 「請唔到人…係根本上啲人有問題」 (the hiring shortage is fundamentally the workers' fault). His argument suffers from severe **temporal parallax** and **survivorship bias**:

1.  **Structural Economic Changes**: The labor market of his youth (likely 1970s-80s Hong Kong) was characterized by manufacturing growth and lower credential requirements. Today's economy demands higher qualifications for entry-level positions while simultaneously offering less job security. The "cash wages" he mentions often signal illegal labor practices or tax evasion—rejecting these is not pickiness but self-preservation against exploitation.

2.  **The "Cash Wage" Fallacy**: He misunderstands why companies offer cash wages. It is not generosity but often a mechanism to evade Mandatory Provident Fund contributions, insurance, and taxes—leaving workers vulnerable. Modern workers correctly recognize that accepting such terms forfeits legal protections.

3.  **False Necessity vs. Virtue**: He conflates his childhood poverty (being forced to work at 13) with moral virtue. Child labor is now illegal precisely because it stunts development. That he "didn't mind" harsh conditions at 13 reflects a lack of alternatives, not a superior work ethic.

4.  **Cost-of-Living Reality**: When he entered the workforce, housing and living costs were proportionally lower relative to wages. Today's "low wages" often fail to cover basic subsistence (rent, food, transport), making the calculation different. Working a dead-end job for survival wages is no longer economically rational when the alternative (living with parents, gig work) offers similar income with more dignity.

5.  **Selection Bias**: He survived; many of his contemporaries who accepted similar conditions did not achieve mobility. The "market" he describes was one where physical labor could eventually lead to small business ownership or skilled trades. Today's service economy offers fewer such ladders.

**Conclusion**: His perspective reflects a **crab-bucket mentality**—having suffered, he expects others to suffer similarly. The hiring shortage reflects not worker laziness but rational actors refusing to accept deteriorating real wages and precarious employment terms. His conclusion ignores that labor standards exist precisely because unregulated exploitation (which he normalized) produces social costs. [end of text]
