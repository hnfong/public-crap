No, I do not buy the story. It reads like a classic internet "smear campaign" or a "hit piece" rather than a genuine account by a concerned former colleague.

Here is a breakdown of why the story lacks credibility:

### 1. The "Sacked for Theft" vs. "Police Vetting" Contradiction
This is the biggest logical hole in the story.
*   **The Claim:** The poster claims Tan was fired for "breaking the bottom of the cabinet" (a Cantonese idiom for embezzlement or theft) and that the boss threatened to call the police if he didn't leave immediately.
*   **The Reality:** In Hong Kong, joining the Police Force requires a rigorous **Vetting process**. This includes a background check that specifically verifies past employment history.
*   **Why it fails:** If Tan had been fired from a major British bank for theft and threatened with police action, there would be an employment record reflecting "dismissal for misconduct." Furthermore, banks in Hong Kong are legally required to report serious financial crimes (like embezzlement) to regulatory bodies. It is virtually impossible for someone with a confirmed record of theft at a major financial institution to pass the Hong Kong Police Force vetting process. The poster asking "I don't know how he passed the vetting gate" is a weak attempt to hand-wave away this massive plot hole.

### 2. The "Shadowing" Timeline Mismatch
*   **The Claim:** The poster says Tan was "newly hired" and shadowing him for a week.
*   **The Reality:** In major investment banks ("英資大行"), new hires—especially those in sensitive positions—usually undergo a background check *before* they start or during their probationary period. However, the story implies he was fired within the first week.
*   **Why it fails:** While people *can* be fired quickly, the specific sequence (hired -> shadowing -> caught stealing -> fired within a week -> police threatened) feels like a dramatic setup rather than a realistic corporate timeline. Theft on that scale usually takes time to discover, or if discovered immediately (e.g., during a cash count), it wouldn't be framed as "shadowing" leading to a discovery; it would be an immediate audit.

### 3. The "British Bank" Cliché
The mention of a "British firm" (英資大行) is a common trope in Hong Kong forum culture used to lend false authority to a comment. It sounds specific but is actually vague (there are many). It serves no purpose other than to make the poster sound like an "insider" or "elite" witness, which is a hallmark of fabrication.

### 4. The "Perfect Villain" Narrative
The story is too convenient. It attacks the recipient's **competence** (fired immediately), **morality** (thief), and **integrity** (failed vetting) all in one breath.
*   The phrase "衰穿櫃桶底" (rotten to the bottom of the cabinet) is a very specific, colorful idiom. While people use it casually, using it to describe a specific event of embezzlement that happened "in the first week" feels like creative writing.
*   The detail about the boss threatening to call the police adds dramatic flair but lacks legal nuance (banks don't usually say "leave or we call police"; they call the police regardless if money is missing).

### 5. Motivation (Sour Grapes)
The context is key: this is a comment on a post about someone receiving an **award**.
*   Genuine colleagues usually come out of the woodwork to say, "Congrats, I knew him, he was hardworking."
*   Only someone with a deep personal grudge (or a troll) would take the time to fabricate a story about being a "bank colleague" just to ruin a celebratory moment. The anonymity of the forum protects the liar, making it a low-effort way to damage someone's reputation.

### Verdict
The story is likely **fake**. It relies on the reader believing that the Hong Kong Police vetting system is incompetent. The contradiction between being fired for theft from a major bank and subsequently passing police background checks makes the account implausible. [end of text]
