The paragraph discusses the difficulties faced by young people in finding jobs, particularly those who are looking for cash-in-hand jobs. The author suggests that these individuals may not have the necessary qualifications or experience to secure such positions, and that the job market is highly competitive. The author also notes that they themselves started working at a young age and were not deterred by the challenges of low pay, hard work, and a lack of job security. The author concludes that the problem of finding workers is not due to a lack of job opportunities, but rather due to the shortcomings of the individuals seeking employment.

I agree with the author's conclusion that the problem of finding workers is not due to a lack of job opportunities, but rather due to the shortcomings of the individuals seeking employment. However, it is important to note that there may be systemic issues at play, such as a lack of access to education or training, that can make it difficult for individuals to secure employment. Additionally, the author's focus on cash-in-hand jobs may not be representative of the broader job market.
