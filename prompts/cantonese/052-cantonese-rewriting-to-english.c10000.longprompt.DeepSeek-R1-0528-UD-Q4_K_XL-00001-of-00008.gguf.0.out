Hmm, the user wants me to rewrite a Cantonese essay into English while preserving the original phrasing and structure, and then analyze its main point while ignoring the sarcastic tone. 

First, I notice this is a politically charged piece discussing Yu Ying-shih's academic career through a critical lens. The author uses heavy Cantonese slang and cultural references that'll be challenging to translate directly. Terms like "撻朵" (name-dropping) and "揸兜" (begging) carry cultural weight beyond literal meaning. 

The rewrite needs to maintain:
- Original sentence structures
- Untranslated hashtags and proper nouns
- Colloquial flavor ("威唔威先!" → "How impressive is that!")
- Cultural concepts like "儒家" as "Confucianism" without explanation

For the analysis part... beneath the sarcasm, the core argument seems to be about intellectual adaptation. The author suggests Yu Ying-shih (and Western sinology generally) repackaged Confucianism as compatible with democracy to gain academic prestige in America, contrasting this with Confucianism's historical role in hierarchical societies. 

Key points to extract:
1) Critique of academic opportunism: Claiming Yu simplified complex philosophies for Western acceptance
2) Historical parallel: Comparing Confucian scholars' adaptation to rulers (Warring States period) to modern scholars adapting to Western academia
3) Rejection of "Confucian democracy": Asserting true Confucianism opposes egalitarian values (using UK/Japan as examples)

The Taiwan example is particularly revealing - the author mocks the idea that ROC represents Confucian governance while noting its leaders don't perform Confucian rituals. This undermines Yu's alleged "Confucian democracy" narrative.

The challenge will be separating the substantive argument from the inflammatory delivery ("仆街陷家鏟" etc.). The real meat is in the historical comparisons and the accusation of intellectual dishonesty for career advancement.

### Rewritten Essay in English:
Three hours ago after work, I went online and saw people mourning #YuYingShih. At the time, I only knew he was the idol of famous blogger Professor #NgaiHungWong. Beyond that, I knew nothing about his life.  

But in the 21st century, you don’t need to consult #teachers for everything—Google knows all. After some searching, I increasingly understood why he’s so famous and why Professor Wong loves mentioning Yu so much...  

Old Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive is that! Just name-dropping him is intimidating!  

I kept stalking Yu Ying-shih’s background like a creep: how Chinese Wikipedia describes him, how English Wikipedia describes him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how today’s obituaries portray him. Then I thought of someone I deeply respect... Master #YunGen. They’re really similar!  

Sadly, Master Gen doesn’t have a Harvard professorship, but their mastery of #AncientAndModernWisdom and #IAmHuaxia traditional Chinese scholarship definitely comes from the same lineage. Master Gen loves Taoism and Buddhism, while Old Yu seems like a Confucianism fan.  

But here’s the tragedy.  

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, fidelity, and hierarchical order. But if you studied at top U.S. universities and got your PhD during the peak hippie era, would you really go around telling people to #RespectTeachersAndTradition and reject #Individualism? You’d end up begging on the streets.  

Speaking of how scholars avoid begging—this was wisdom Confucius earned through a lifetime of hardship. His disciples knew it well: In Confucius’ time, chaos loomed. He traveled between states seeking office to achieve greatness. But he only knew how to recite Zhou Dynasty rituals, failing to cater to his bosses’ needs. Yet failure breeds success—his students improved drastically. As Sima Qian wrote: "His seventy disciples scattered among lords, some becoming tutors or ministers, others advising officials." How?  

After generations, they learned to read rulers’ moods. By Mencius’ era, interactions with kings were different—charming bosses with flattery: "King Qi, you couldn’t bear to kill an ox! You’re truly benevolent! You can rule with virtue!"  

By the Warring States period, "Confucian" strategists mastered the art of royal interviews. To secure positions, they abandoned "benevolence" and "propriety," embracing "legalism" instead. Thus, Xunzi—a Confucian—produced students like Li Si, who served Qin Shihuang’s regime. You’d smell nothing of Confucius on him.  

Today, with 200+ UN nations, the world’s more complex than the Spring-Autumn era. When Confucian heirs leave China’s (ancient) land of rites for the barbaric U.S. military hegemony, would they really pull out the *Analects* and demand #ThreeYearsMourning? Everyone knows how Confucius was rejected. So in America, Confucians declare: "The Master supported #Democracy! Democracy is supreme! CCP go to hell!" That’s how you get Ivy League professorships!  

Some might ask: Can you just spout nonsense without consequences? Of course! Confucius and Mencius died 2,000 years ago. Confucianism was smashed in the #MayFourthMovement. As a top academic authority in the postwar superpower, if you claimed "Johnny Kung advocated drugs and women," people might believe it—U.S. #TheoreticalNukes are legit. Japan learned this the hard way.  

So how did Old Yu translate a few *Book of Han* passages into English to earn a PhD and multiple professorships? #YouKnowWhy. They elevate you as an authority so you’ll declare: "You’re all fools! You think Confucius was feudal? Wrong! He was a democratic warrior! Without Ivy credentials, sit down and listen!"  

As for whether Confucianism conflicts with democracy? Honestly, what do "sinologists" know? You say: "Look at Taiwan!" But is Taiwan’s system "Confucian"? Do KMT bigwigs cursing Tsai Ing-wen daily follow Confucianism? Does Tsai perform grand rituals? No. Scientific spirit ≠ Confucian mysticism. Using Chinese characters ≠ Confucianism. Confucianism ≠ exclusive to China.  

As I said earlier: Japan is Confucian. Britain is Confucian (at least among advanced nations). Monarchs uphold ritualistic grandeur; heaven-granted authority is absolute. No cursing superiors. Hierarchical stability. Their democratic successes/failures? Not for a Chinese-American to judge.

### Commentary (Ignoring Sarcasm):  
The author’s core argument is a critique of **intellectual opportunism and cultural reinterpretation**. They contend that Yu Ying-shih (and Western academia) selectively repackaged Confucianism as compatible with Western democratic values to gain prestige, divorcing it from its historical essence. Key points:  

1. **Adaptation Over Integrity**: Confucian scholars historically adapted doctrines to please rulers (e.g., Mencius flattering kings, Xunzi’s students embracing legalism). Similarly, modern scholars allegedly distort Confucianism to align with Western ideologies for career advancement.  

2. **Rejection of "Confucian Democracy"**: The author asserts that true Confucianism emphasizes hierarchy, ritual, and anti-egalitarian values—fundamentally incompatible with individualism/democracy. Examples like the UK/Japan highlight hierarchical stability, not democratic Confucianism.  

3. **Academic Legitimacy as Power**: Western institutions legitimize reinterpreted "Confucianism" (e.g., linking it to democracy) to maintain intellectual authority, while dismissing authentic traditions as "feudal."  

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The essay implies that this reinterpretation erodes Confucianism’s core principles (e.g., rituals, filial piety) and ignores its historical role in reinforcing social order.  

**Ultimate Thesis**: Yu Ying-shih’s acclaim symbolizes how traditional philosophies are diluted and weaponized to serve Western academic and political narratives, sacrificing cultural authenticity for institutional validation. [end of text]
