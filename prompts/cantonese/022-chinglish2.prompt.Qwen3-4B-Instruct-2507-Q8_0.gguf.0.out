## Alice:  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really enjoy playing.  
But I never gamble, though.  

## Bob:  
Hmm... I never gamble in Big2 either.  
Well, except a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:  
A few weeks ago with Joe Mud?  

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, "Let’s play!"  
He said, "I’ll give you just one cent per card—because he plays really well."  
I said, "No way!" I thought, "That’s too much." Besides, I’d lose at most around $10, which isn’t bad.  

## Alice:  
You said "no way," right?  
Haha. You’re so young and careless.  
Actually, it’s not bad. But if you keep gambling, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

## Bob:  
But it’s not good to "stand so hard" — that means being too strict or not taking risks.  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:  
I don’t have the program.  
I don’t know where to download it.  

## Bob:  
You have to play online, so you need the program.  
My computer doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP. Wait…  

## Alice:  
Oh, okay.  
Haha. I didn’t know.  
Hehe. [end of text]
