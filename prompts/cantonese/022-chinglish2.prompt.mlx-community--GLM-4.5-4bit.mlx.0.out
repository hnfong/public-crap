Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

**Alice:**
Haha, yeah, me too. I really like to play, but I never gamble. :)

**Bob:**
Oh, I don't gamble on Big Two either, except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago, did Joe lose badly?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I said okay. Then he said we'd play for one cent per card because he's very good. So I just had to be "so heroic." Besides, the most I could lose was something like $10.

**Alice:**
I see. :) Hehe, your luck is actually not that bad. It's good, actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the game.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so "hardcore" about it. Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful. By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program? No. Do I need to download it or something? :)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online, you obviously need a program. My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me using FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:**
Okay. :) Thank you. Hehe.
