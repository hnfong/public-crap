I don't buy the story. Here's why:

1. The commenter claims to have worked with the police officer at a bank, but the story they tell is about the officer's past behavior, not their work performance or any relevant skills they may have demonstrated on the job.
2. The story is about the officer's personal problems, such as being fired from a job for being late, and their behavior being so bad that their supervisor threatened to report them to the authorities. This doesn't seem like the kind of behavior that would be considered "outstanding" or worthy of an award.
3. The commenter implies that the officer's personal problems somehow affected their ability to pass a vetting process, but this is not a clear or convincing explanation for their success as a police officer.
4. The tone of the story is sarcastic and mocking, which suggests that the commenter is not genuinely trying to praise the officer, but rather to criticize them.

Overall, the story seems like a attempt to discredit the police officer and undermine their achievement, rather than a genuine tribute or congratulations. [end of text]
