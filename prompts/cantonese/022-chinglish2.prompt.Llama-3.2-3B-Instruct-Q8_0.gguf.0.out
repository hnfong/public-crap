Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Ha ha.
Yeah, me too.
I like playing very much.
But I never gamble, haha.

## Bob:
Oh... I don't gamble either, right?
Except for that time a few weeks ago

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, what happened?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
I said, "Let's play, but just for fun."
He said, "I'll bet 1 cent for a card... because he's really good at it."
I said, "Okay, I'll play too... besides, I might lose something like $10, haha..."

## Alice:
Ha ha, that's funny.
Hehe. It's actually pretty good, but if I were to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
But it's not good to "play too hard"...
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
No program.
Maybe I can download it from you.

## Bob:
I'll play online because we need a program to play, right?
My computer doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... wait...

## Alice:
Ha ha.
Okay, I'll go get it.
Hehe. [end of text]
