The user wants me to translate "Chinglish" phrases into Cantonese. The description says it's basically Cantonese written down using English characters (romanization) and often mixed with English words. The examples show:

- "nei ho" => 你好 (Hello)
- "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => 你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？ (Did you watch the singing competition?)

So I need to:
1. Identify the Cantonese words from the romanization
2. Identify any English words that are code-mixed
3. Convert the romanization to proper Chinese characters (Cantonese)
4. Keep the English words as they are
5. Add appropriate Cantonese particles and grammar

Let me analyze each phrase:

1. "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"
   - "gor" = 嗰 (that)
   - "doe" = 度 (place)
   - "yau" = 有 (have)
   - "gor" = 個 (classifier)
   - "bin" = 邊 (which)
   - "tai" = 睇 (see/watch)
   - "lo" = 囉 (particle)
   - "ah" = 呀 (particle)
   - So: 嗰度有個邊睇囉呀? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine.
   - "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there)
   - "yau" = 有 (have)
   - "gor" = 個 (classifier)
   - "bin" = 邊 (which/side)
   - "tai" = 睇 (see)
   - "lo ah" = 囉呀 (particles)
   - Maybe it's: 嗰度有個邊... hmm
   - Alternative: "gor doe" could be 嗰個 (that one), "yau gor bin" = 有個邊 (have a side?) No.
   - Let me think about common Cantonese phrases. "gor doe" could be 嗰個 (that one), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - Wait, maybe "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau gor bin" = 有邊個 (who has)
   - Actually, "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" - maybe it's "嗰度有個邊睇囉呀"? That doesn't make sense.
   - Let me reconsider: "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - Or: "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - "嗰度有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who's watching there?" Still sounds odd.
   - Another interpretation: "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor" = 個, "bin tai" = 邊睇 (where to watch), "lo ah" = 囉呀
   - Hmm, maybe "bin tai" is a name? No.
   - Let me think about the context. This seems like a question.
   - "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai" = 睇, "lo ah" = 囉呀
   - "嗰啲有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who watches those?"
   - Wait, maybe "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - "嗰度有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who's watching there?"
   - But the "gor" before "bin" is confusing. Could be "嗰度有個邊...". No.
   - Let me try: "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor" = 個, "bin" = 邊 (which), "tai" = 睇, "lo ah" = 囉呀
   - "嗰啲有個邊睇囉呀" - doesn't make sense.
   - Maybe it's: "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - "嗰啲有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who watches those?"
   - Or maybe "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 邊個 (who), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - "嗰度有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who's watching there?"
   - Actually, looking at the structure again: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"
   - Could be: "嗰啲有邊個睇囉呀" - "Who watches those?"
   - But "gor bin" might be "邊個" reversed? No, the order is "gor bin".
   - Wait, maybe "gor bin" is a single concept? No, "bin" is clearly 邊.
   - Let me think differently. "gor doe" could be 嗰啲 (those), "yau gor" = 有個 (have a), "bin tai" = 邊睇 (where to watch), "lo ah" = 囉呀
   - "嗰啲有個邊睇囉呀" - still doesn't make sense.
   - Another approach: "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor bin" = 個邊 (the side), "tai lo ah" = 睇囉呀
   - "嗰啲有個邊睇囉呀" - nonsense.
   - Let me reconsider the romanization. "gor" is often 嗰 (that), "doe" could be 啲 (some/those), "yau" = 有, "gor" = 個, "bin" = 邊 (which), "tai" = 睇, "lo ah" = 囉呀
   - Maybe it's: "嗰啲有邊個睇囉呀" but written as "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"
   - Actually, in Cantonese, "邊個" is "who", but here it's "gor bin". Could be a typo in the romanization?
   - Wait, maybe "gor bin" is "個邊" meaning "that side"? But then "tai" is separate.
   - Let me think about the whole phrase structure. It seems like a question.
   - "gor doe" = 嗰啲 (those), "yau" = 有, "gor
