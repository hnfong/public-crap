No, I do not buy the story—and here's why:

1. **Inconsistent Terminology & Logic**  
   - The phrase *“衰穿櫃桶底”* (literally “bad luck to the bottom of the柜桶”—a nonsensical idiom) appears to be a garbled or fabricated expression. In Hong Kong Cantonese, common phrases for being fired include *“炒鱿鱼”* (chǎo yóuyú, “stir-fry squid” → slang for dismissal) or *“開除”* (kāichú, “expulsion”). *“櫃桶底”* isn’t a real idiom—it sounds like a mistranslation or invented phrase, undermining credibility.

2. **Contradictory Timeline & Motivation**  
   - The narrator claims to have worked with “Chen Dawen” for a year *before* he became a police officer, yet says he was fired *in his first week* of employment—then later says they “共事一年” (worked together for a year). This is a direct contradiction.

3. **Implausible Dismissal Narrative**  
   - The claim that the boss threatened *“you won’t leave today unless I call the police”*—and then *“senior management came down with security to escort him out the same afternoon*—is overly dramatic and lacks realism. Standard HR procedure for a dismissal (especially for misconduct) would involve documented warnings, not impromptu police-style escort unless criminal activity was involved—which isn’t stated.

4. **Vetting Suspicion Without Evidence**  
   - The comment ends with *“I don’t know why he passed the vetting”*—a vague, unsubstantiated accusation. Police vetting in Hong Kong (including background checks, financial review, psychological assessment, and character references) is rigorous. Accusing someone of “personal issues” passing vetting without specifics is speculative and potentially defamatory.

5. **Possible Satire or Troll Post**  
   - The tone, mixed with grammatical quirks (e.g., *“下晝”* instead of standard *“下午”*), and the absurd *“櫃桶底”* phrase suggest this may be a parody, AI-generated, or deliberately misleading post—common in online forums to mock or provoke.

✅ **Conclusion**: The story contains internal inconsistencies, fabricated idioms, and unsupported claims. It reads more like satire, misinformation, or a troll post than a credible testimony. Without corroborating evidence, it should not be believed.
