Okay, let's tackle this translation task. The user wants me to convert Chinglish phrases into proper Cantonese. First, I need to understand what Chinglish means in this context. From the examples given, it's Cantonese written with English characters, often using non-standard spellings and code-mixing English words.

Looking at the examples:
- "nei ho" becomes "你好" (hello)
- "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" becomes "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？" (Have you watched the singing competition?)

So, the key is to take the Chinglish (which is a mix of Cantonese pronunciation and English words) and convert it to standard Cantonese written in Chinese characters.

Let me go through each phrase one by one.

1. "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"
Breaking it down:
- "gor" might be "go" or "goh" (like "go" in Cantonese, but maybe "goh" as in "have" or "got"?)
Wait, in the examples, "nei" is "you", so "gor" might be "have" (as in "yau" is "have" but maybe "gor" is a typo or different spelling). Wait, "yau" in the example was "有" (have), so "yau" is "have". So "gor doe yau" might be "have you" but "gor" could be "go" or "goh" as in "want" or something else.

Wait, "gor" might be "go" but in Cantonese, "go" is "go" but maybe it's "goh" as in "have" but the example uses "yau" for "have". Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – maybe "gor" is "go" (as in "go to"), "doe" might be "to" (like "to" in English), "yau" is "have", "gor bin" might be "can't" or "not", "tai lo" might be "too much" or "too late", "ah" is the particle.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "go" (as in "go to"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", "ah" is the particle.

Wait, but the example "nei yau moe tai sing con ah" translates to "you have not watched the singing competition, right?" So "yau" is "have", "moe" is "not", "tai" is "watched", "sing con" is "singing competition".

So for phrase 1: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"

Let's parse each part:

- "gor" – maybe "go" (as in "go to"), but in Cantonese, "go" is "go", but maybe it's a typo for "goh" (like "have" but the example uses "yau" for have). Wait, maybe "gor" is "have" but misspelled. Wait, in the example, "yau" is "have", so "gor" might be something else.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "go"), but in Cantonese, "go" is "go", but sometimes written as "goh" in Chinglish. Let's see.

"gor doe" – "go to" (like "go to" something). "yau" is "have", "gor bin" – "gor" might be "can't" (like "can't" is "goh bin" but maybe "gor" is "can't" here). Wait, "gor bin" might be "can't" (as in "cannot"), but "gor" could be "goh" (can't). Wait, "gor" might be "goh" (as in "can't" in Cantonese, but I'm not sure).

Wait, maybe "gor" is "go" (as in "go"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", "ah" is the particle.

So "go to have can't too much ah" – that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but that's not right.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "have" (but the example uses "yau" for have, so maybe "gor" is a different word). Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "want" or "go"). Let's think of common Cantonese phrases.

Wait, "gor" might be "goh" (as in "go"), but in the example, "nei" is "you", so "nei" is "you", "ho" is "hello". So "gor" might be "go" (as in "go"), "doe" might be "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" might be "can't", "tai lo" might be "too much", "ah" is the particle.

Wait, maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but that's not making sense. Maybe "gor" is "have" but misspelled. Wait, "yau" is "have", so "gor" might be "go" (as in "go to"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", "ah" is the particle.

Wait, maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but that's not right. Maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "want"), but I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "go"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "go to have can't too much ah" – maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but that's not a proper phrase.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "go"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "go to have can't too much" – maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but that's not making sense. Maybe "tai lo" is "too late" or "too much".

Wait, "tai lo" – "tai" might be "too", "lo" might be "late" (like "tai lo" as "too late"). So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "go to have can't too late ah" – maybe "I can't go to have it too late" but that's not right.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "have" (but the example uses "yau" for have, so maybe "gor" is a typo for "yau" but that's not likely). Let's look for other clues.

Wait, in the example, "nei yau moe tai sing con ah" – "nei" (you), "yau" (have), "moe" (not), "tai" (watched), "sing con" (singing competition), "ah" (particle). So "yau" is "have", "moe" is "not", "tai" is "watched".

So for phrase 1: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"

Breaking down:

- "gor" – maybe "go" (as in "go to"), but "gor" might be "goh" (go)
- "doe" – "to" (like "to" in English)
- "yau" – "have"
- "gor bin" – "can't" (gor = can't, bin = not? Or "gor" is "can't", "bin" is "not"?)
- "tai lo" – "too late" (tai = too, lo = late)
- "ah" – particle

So "go to have can't too late ah" – maybe "I can't go to have it too late" but that's not right. Maybe it's "I can't go to have it too late" but in Cantonese, maybe it's "I can't go to watch it too late" but "tai lo" might be "too late".

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too late", so "go to have can't too late ah" – perhaps it's "I can't go to have it too late" but that's not a natural phrase. Maybe it's "I can't go to watch it too late" but "tai" is "watched" in the example, so "tai" might be "watched", but here "tai lo" might be "too late".

Wait, maybe "tai lo" is "too much" (tai = too, lo = much). So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "go to have can't too much ah" – maybe "I can't go to have too much" but that's not making sense. Maybe it's "I can't go to have it too much" but that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe "gor" is "goh" (want), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "want to have can't too much" – "I can't want to have too much" – no.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "go to have can't too much" – maybe it's "I can't go to have too much" but in Cantonese, maybe it's "I can't go to have it too much" but that's not a common phrase.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (as in "go"), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too late", so "I can't go to have it too late" – but "have" here might be "have to" or "have time". Maybe it's "I can't go to have it too late" meaning "I can't go to watch it too late" (like a show that ends late).

Wait, maybe "tai lo" is "too late", so "I can't go to watch it too late" – but "tai" in the example was "watched", so "tai" might be "watched", but here "tai lo" might be "too late". So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "go to have can't too late ah" – maybe it's "I can't go to watch it too late" but "yau" is "have", so "have to go" or something.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too late", so "go to have can't too late" – perhaps it's "I can't go to have it too late" but in Cantonese, maybe it's "I can't go to watch it too late" (like a TV show that's late).

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too late", so the translation would be "我唔可以去睇太遲呀" (I can't go to watch it too late). But "tai lo" might be "too late", so "tai lo" = "too late", so "tai lo" would be "太遲" in Chinese.

So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" → "我唔可以去睇太遲呀" but let's check the structure.

Wait, "gor" might be "go" (goh), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too late", "ah" is the particle.

So "I can't go to have too late" → "I can't go to watch it too late" → "我唔可以去睇太遲呀".

But "yau" is "have", so "yau" here might be part of "have to", but "gor bin" is "can't", so "gor bin" = "can't", so "gor bin" = "唔可以" (can't), "yau" might be "have" but maybe it's a typo. Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", so "go to have can't" → "can't go to have" → "I can't go to have" → "I can't go to have it" → "I can't go to watch it".

Wait, maybe "yau" is "have" as in "have to", so "yau" is "have to", but in the example, "yau" was "have" (as in "have you watched"), so "yau" is "have", not "have to".

This is getting confusing. Let's try to look for common phrases.

Another approach: look for words that match Cantonese.

"gor" – in Cantonese, "go" is "go", but sometimes written as "goh" in Chinglish. "doe" might be "to" (like "to" in English, but in Cantonese, "to" is "to" or "da" for "to go", but maybe "doe" is "to" as in "to go").

"yau" – as in the example, "yau" is "have" (有).

"gor bin" – "gor" might be "goh" (can't), "bin" might be "not", so "goh bin" = "can't" (like "goh" = can't, "bin" = not, but usually "goh" is "can't" in some contexts).

"tai lo" – "tai" = too, "lo" = late (like "tai lo" = too late).

"ah" – particle.

So putting it together: "I can't go to have too late" → "I can't go to watch it too late" → "我唔可以去睇太遲呀".

But "yau" is "have", so "yau" might be part of "have to", but maybe it's a typo. Wait, maybe "gor doe yau" is "go to have" (go to have something), but "gor bin" is "can't", so "can't go to have", so "I can't go to have it" → "I can't go to watch it" (assuming "have" here is "watch" as in "have a look").

Wait, in the example, "tai" was "watched" (睇), so "tai" might be "watch", so "tai lo" = "watch too late" → "watch it too late".

So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" → "go to have can't watch too late ah" → "I can't go to watch it too late" → "我唔可以去睇太遲呀".

But let's check the structure. "gor" = go, "doe" = to, "yau" = have, "gor bin" = can't, "tai lo" = too late.

Wait, maybe "yau" is "you" but no, "nei" is "you" in the example. So "yau" is "have".

Another possibility: "gor" is "goh" (want), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "want to have can't too much" → "I can't want to have too much" → not making sense.

Wait, maybe "gor" is "goh" (go), "doe" is "to", "yau" is "have", "gor bin" is "can't", "tai lo" is "too much", so "go to have can't too much" → "I can't go to have too much" → "我唔可以去食太多呀" (I can't go to eat too much), but "tai lo" might be "too much", so "tai lo" = "太多".

Wait, "tai lo" – "tai" = too, "lo" = much (like "lo" as in "lot", but "lo" might be "much" in some contexts). So "tai lo" = "too much".

So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" → "I can't go to have too much" → "我唔可以去食太多呀" (if it's about eating), but the context isn't clear. But the example was about watching a competition, so maybe it's about watching something.

Wait, maybe "tai" is "watched" (from the example), so "tai" = 睇, "lo" might be a typo for "lo" as in "late", but "tai lo" could be "too late" (tai = too, lo = late).

So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" → "I can't go to watch it too late" → "我唔可以去睇太遲呀".

Let's tentatively go with that.

2. "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?"

Breaking it down:

- "ngor" – maybe "I" (like "ngo" in Cantonese for "I", but "ngor" might be "ngo" misspelled)
- "ng sik" – "I think" (ng = I, sik = think)
- "use fai zi gah" – "use" (use), "fai zi" (maybe "fai" = "fail", "zi" = "to", so "fail to" or "fai zi" = "fai" (fail) + "zi" (to), so "fail to")
- "gah" – particle (like "ah" but "gah")
- "use chi gang duck ng duck" – "use" (use), "chi" (maybe "chi" = "to", "gang" = "can", "duck" = "duck" or "duck" as in "duck" (like "duck" as in "duck" the question), "ng" = "and", "duck" again.

Wait, "ng" is "and" in Cantonese (like "ngo" is "I", "ng" is "and").

"chi gang" – "chi" might be "to", "gang" might be "can", so "chi gang" = "can to" → "can" (gang = can).

"duck" – maybe "duck" is "duck" as in "duck" (like "duck" the question), but in Cantonese, "duck" might be "dak" (to duck), but "duck" is written as "duck" in Chinglish.

"ng duck" – "and duck", so "duck" might be a typo for "duck" (like "duck" as in "duck" the question), but maybe "duck" is "dak" (to duck), but written as "duck".

Wait, "use chi gang duck ng duck" – "use" (use), "chi" (to), "gang" (can), "duck" (duck), "ng" (and), "duck" (duck). So "use to can duck and duck" – maybe "use to can duck and duck" → "can't duck and duck" → "can't duck and duck" (not making sense).

Wait, maybe "duck" is "dak" (to duck), but written as "duck". So "use chi gang duck" → "use to can duck" → "can't duck" (since "gang" is "can", so "chi gang" = "can to", but "gang" might be "can't" here).

Wait, "gang" might be "can't" (like "goh" for can't, but "gang" might be a typo). Or "gang" is "can", so "chi gang" = "can to", so "can to duck" → "can duck".

But "use chi gang duck" → "use to can duck" → "can duck".

"ng duck" → "and duck", so "can duck and duck" → "can duck and duck" (redundant).

Wait, maybe "duck" is "duck" as in "duck" (like "duck" the question), but in Cantonese, "duck" might be "dak" (to avoid), so "duck" = "dak".

So "use chi gang duck" → "can't duck" (if "gang" is "can't"), but "gang" is usually "can", so "chi gang" = "can to", so "can duck".

But the phrase is "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?"

"ngor" = I, "ng sik" = think, "use fai zi gah" = use fail to (gah is particle), "use chi gang duck ng duck" = use to can duck and duck.

Wait, "fai zi" – "fai" = fail, "zi" = to, so "fail to" → "can't".

So "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" → "I think use fail to" → "I think I can't" (since "fai zi" = fail to, so "can't").

"use chi gang duck ng duck" → "use to can duck and duck" → "can duck and duck" → "can't duck and duck" (if "gang" is "can't").

Wait, maybe "gang" is "can't" (like "goh" for can't, but "gang" might be a typo). So "chi gang" = "can't to", so "can't duck".

"ng duck" → "and duck", so "can't duck and duck" → "can't duck and duck" (redundant), so maybe "can't duck" (the question is "can't duck and duck?" → "can't duck?" but it's confusing).

Alternatively, "duck" might be "duck" as in "duck" (like "duck" the question), so "can't duck the question" → "can't avoid the question".

But "ng duck" might be "and duck", so "can't duck and duck" → "can't duck" (the "and duck" is a typo).

Wait, maybe "duck" is "dak" (to duck), so "duck" = "dak", so "use chi gang duck" → "can't duck" (if "gang" is "can't"), so "use chi gang duck" → "can't duck".

"ng duck" → "and duck", so maybe it's "can't duck and duck" → "can't duck" (redundant), so the phrase is "I think I can't fail to, can't duck and duck?" → not making sense.

Wait, maybe "fai zi" is "fail to", so "use fai zi" = "can't fail to", but "fai" is "fail", so "can't fail to" → "must".

"ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" → "I think I must" (since "can't fail to" means "must").

"use chi gang duck ng duck" → "can't duck and duck" → "can't duck" (the question is "can't duck?").

So the translation might be "我覺得我一定要，唔可以避開呀？" (I think I must, can't avoid it?).

But let's try to parse it again.

"ngor ng sik" = I think (ngo = I, sik = think)

"use fai zi gah" = use fail to (gah = particle), so "can't fail to" → "must"

"use chi gang duck ng duck" = use to can duck and duck → "can't duck" (if "gang" is "can't")

So "I think I must, can't duck and duck?" → "I think I must, can't avoid it?"

So translation: "我覺得我一定要，唔可以避開呀？"

But "duck" as "dak" (to avoid), so "duck" = 避 (avoid), so "duck" = 避.

So "use chi gang duck" → "can't duck" → "can't avoid".

"ng duck" → "and duck" → maybe a typo, so "can't duck" → "唔可以避開".

So the phrase is "I think I must, can't avoid it?" → "我覺得我一定要，唔可以避開呀？"

3. "mud yeah lei ga?"

"mud" – maybe "mud" = "mou" (not), "yeah" = "ye" (yes), "lei" = "lei" (like "lei" as in "lei" for "to", but "lei" might be "le" (to), "ga" = "ga" (particle).

Wait, "mud" – in Cantonese, "mou" is "not", so "mud" might be "mou" (not).

"yeah" – "ye" (yes), but "yeah" might be "ye" as in "yes", but in Cantonese, "ye" is "yes", but "yeah" is written as "ye" in Chinglish.

"lei" – "lei" might be "le" (to), so "lei" = "le" (to).

"ga" – particle.

So "mud yeah lei ga" → "not yes to ga" → "not yes to" → "not yes" → "no".

But "mud" = "mou" (not), "yeah" = "ye" (yes), so "mou ye" = "no", "lei" = "le" (to), "ga" = particle.

So "mou ye le ga" → "no to" → "no" (as in "no, I don't want to").

So translation: "唔係呀？" (No?).

Wait, "mud yeah lei ga" → "mou ye le ga" → "mou" (not) + "ye" (yes) + "le" (to) + "ga" (particle) → "not yes to" → "no" (as in "no, I don't agree").

So "mud yeah lei ga?" → "唔係呀？" (No?).

4. "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah"

"but" – "but" (as in "but"), "yuu" – "yau" (have), "yat" – "yat" (one), "chai" – "chai" (tea), "yum" – "yum" (drink), "cha" – "cha" (tea), "lah" – particle.

Wait, "but" might be "but" as in "but", but in Cantonese, "but" is "but" or "but" as in "but", but maybe "but" is "but" (like "but" in English).

"yuu" – "yau" (have), so "yuu" = "yau" (have).

"yat" – "yat" (one), so "yat" = "1" (one).

"chai" – "chai" (tea), "yum" – "yum" (drink), "cha" – "cha" (tea), "lah" – particle.

So "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" → "but have one tea drink tea lah" → "but have one tea to drink tea" → "but I have one tea to drink" → "but I have a cup of tea to drink".

Wait, "chai" is "tea", "yum cha" is "drink tea", so "chai yum cha" = "tea drink tea" → "drink tea".

"yuu yat chai" = "have one tea", so "have one tea to drink" → "I have a tea to drink".

"but" might be "but" as in "but", so "but I have a tea to drink" → "But I have a cup of tea to drink."

But "but" might be a typo for "but" as in "but", but in Cantonese, "but" is "but" or "but" as in "but", but maybe it's "but" as in "but" (like "but" in English), but the phrase might be "I have one tea to drink" with "but" being a typo.

Wait, "but" might be "but" as in "but", but maybe it's "but" as in "but" (like "but" in "but I have..."), so "but I have one tea to drink".

But "yuu yat chai" = "have one tea", "yum cha" = "drink tea", so "have one tea to drink".

So translation: "但我有一杯茶要飲呀" (But I have a cup of tea to drink).

Wait, "but" might be "but" as in "but", but in Cantonese, "but" is "but" or "but" as in "but", but maybe it's a typo for "but" as in "but", so "but" = "但".

"yuu" = "have", "yat" = "one", "chai" = "tea", "yum" = "drink", "cha" = "tea", so "yum cha" = "drink tea", so "yuu yat chai yum cha" = "have one tea drink tea" → "have one tea to drink".

So "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" → "But I have one tea to drink." → "但我有一杯茶要飲呀".

5. "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu"

"gor" – go, "password" – password, "send" – send, "jor" – "jor" (to), "hui" – "hui" (back), "nei" – you, "gor" – go, "yahoo" – yahoo, "email" – email, "lu" – "lu" (address).

So "go password send to back you go yahoo email address".

"gor" = go, "password" = password, "send" = send, "jor" = to, "hui" = back, "nei" = you, "gor" = go, "yahoo" = yahoo, "email" = email, "lu" = address.

So "go password send to back you go yahoo email address" → "Send the password back to you via Yahoo email address."

Translation: "請將密碼發送回你嘅 Yahoo 電郵地址。"

But "jor hui" might be "jor" = to, "hui" = back, so "send to back" → "send back".

"nei gor" – "nei" = you, "gor" = go, so "you go" → "you" (since "gor" might be a typo for "go", but "nei" is "you", so "nei" = you.

"gor yahoo email lu" – "go Yahoo email address" → "Yahoo email address".

So "Send the password back to you via Yahoo email address." → "請將密碼發送回你嘅 Yahoo 電郵地址。"

6. "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga"

"farn" – "farn" (maybe "fan" = "fan", but "farn" might be "fan" as in "fan", "hok" = "hok" (to), "ho" = "ho" (hello), "sun" = "sun" (sun), "fu" = "fu" (to), "lor" = "lor" (particle), "gei" = "gei" (give), "si" = "si" (to), "sin" = "sin" (new), "fong" = "fong" (to), "ga" = "ga" (particle).

Wait, "farn hok ho sun fu lor" – "farn" might be "fan" (fan), "hok" = "hok" (to), "ho" = "ho" (hello), "sun" = "sun" (sun), "fu" = "fu" (to), "lor" = particle.

"gei si sin fong ga" – "gei" = give, "si" = to, "sin" = new, "fong" = to, "ga" = particle.

This is tricky. Let's look for common phrases.

"farn hok" – "farn" might be "fan" (fan), "hok" = "hok" (to), so "fan hok" = "fan to" → "fan to" (not making sense).

Wait, "farn" might be "fan" (as in "fan" for "fan"), but "hok" might be "hok" (to), "ho" = "ho" (hello), so "farn hok ho" = "fan to hello" → "fan to hello" → "fan hello" (not making sense).

Wait, "farn" might be "fan" (as in "fan" for "fan"), but maybe "farn" is "fan" (to), "hok" = "hok" (to), so "fan hok" = "to to" → redundant.

Alternatively, "farn" might be "fan" (as in "fan" for "fan"), "hok" = "hok" (to), "ho" = "ho" (hello), so "fan hok ho" = "fan to hello" → "fan hello" → "hello fan" (not right).

Wait, "farn" might be "fan" (as in "fan" for "fan"), but maybe it's "fan" as in "fan" (to), so "fan" = "to", "hok" = "hok" (to), so "fan hok" = "to to" → "to".

"ho" = "ho" (hello), "sun" = "sun" (sun), "fu" = "fu" (to), "lor
