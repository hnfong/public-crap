The person is a middle-aged man who has been working since he was 13 years old. He is currently facing the problem of young people complaining about not being able to find jobs, despite the availability of cash-paying jobs. He believes that the reason companies offer cash payments is to attract job seekers, but he questions why these young people are not willing to take these jobs. He points out that these young people lack experience and education, which makes it difficult for them to find employment. He concludes that the problem lies with the individuals themselves, not with the companies or job offers.

I agree with his conclusion to some extent. While it is true that individuals need to improve their skills and qualifications to increase their chances of finding employment, it is also important to consider the broader economic and social factors that may be contributing to the difficulty in finding jobs. Additionally, companies and society as a whole have a responsibility to provide opportunities and support for individuals who may not have the same advantages as others. Therefore, while personal responsibility is important, it is not the only factor at play in the job market. (English)
