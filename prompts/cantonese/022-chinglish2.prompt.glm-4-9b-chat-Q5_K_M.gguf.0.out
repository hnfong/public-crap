## Alice:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really enjoy playing games.
But I never gamble, though.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I don't gamble at big2 either, either.
Except for one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, was it Joe Mud?

## Bob:
He went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play big2.
I said, "Let's play."
He said, "One cent for a card..." (Because he's really good at it)
I lost big time... Besides, I might lose like $10 at most.

## Alice:
Oh, that's okay.
Haha. It's actually fun. But if I knew you were gambling, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
But it's not good to "stand so hard" like that...
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
Meh, the program.
I don't know, did you download it or something?
:)

## Bob:
Of course, you need a program to play online.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me through ftp or http... wait...

## Alice:
Huh, okay.
Haha. I'll get it from you.
