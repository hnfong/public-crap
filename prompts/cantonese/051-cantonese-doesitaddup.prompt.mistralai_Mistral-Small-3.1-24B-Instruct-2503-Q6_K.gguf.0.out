The story shared on the forum is quite detailed and paints a vivid picture of the individual in question, Chen Da Wen. Here are some points to consider when evaluating the credibility of the story:

### Positive Indicators:
1. **Specific Details**: The comment includes specific details such as the duration of employment (one year), the type of bank (an English-owned bank), and the sequence of events leading to Chen Da Wen's departure.
2. **Personal Experience**: The commenter claims to have worked with Chen Da Wen and even shadowed him during his first week, which adds a layer of personal experience and familiarity.
3. **Consistency**: The narrative is consistent in its portrayal of Chen Da Wen's behavior and the consequences of his actions.

### Negative Indicators:
1. **Motivation**: The commenter's motivation for sharing this story is unclear. If the commenter has a grudge or personal issue with Chen Da Wen, the story might be biased or exaggerated.
2. **Lack of Verification**: There is no independent verification of the events described. The story relies solely on the commenter's account.
3. **Vetting Process**: The commenter questions how Chen Da Wen passed the vetting process to become a police officer, which could indicate skepticism about the official procedures.

### Analysis:
- **Credibility**: The story could be true, but it's also possible that it's an exaggerated or fabricated account. The specific details and personal experience lend some credibility, but the lack of independent verification and the potential for bias are significant concerns.
- **Motivation**: If the commenter has a personal grudge or is trying to discredit Chen Da Wen, the story might be biased. However, if the commenter is genuinely sharing their experience, the story could be more reliable.
- **Vetting Process**: The commenter's skepticism about the vetting process is a valid point. If Chen Da Wen did have personal issues, it's reasonable to question how he passed the vetting process.

### Conclusion:
While the story is detailed and includes specific personal experiences, it should be approached with caution. The lack of independent verification and the potential for bias mean that the story cannot be fully trusted without further evidence. If you are considering the credibility of this story, it would be wise to seek additional sources or corroborating information. [end of text]
