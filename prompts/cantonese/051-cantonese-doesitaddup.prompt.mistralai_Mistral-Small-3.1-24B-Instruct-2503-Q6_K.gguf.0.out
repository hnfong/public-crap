The story shared on the forum is quite detailed and paints a vivid picture of the individual in question, Chen Da Wen. Here are some points to consider when evaluating the credibility of the story:

### Positive Indicators:
1. **Specific Details**: The comment provides specific details about the incident, such as the timing (first week of employment), the reason for dismissal (wearing inappropriate clothing), and the actions taken by the supervisor (threatening to report to authorities and having security escort him out).
2. **Consistency**: The narrative is consistent in its description of events, which can be a sign of truthfulness.
3. **Personal Connection**: The commenter claims to have worked with Chen Da Wen, which adds a layer of credibility as it suggests firsthand knowledge.

### Negative Indicators:
1. **Anonymity**: The commenter is anonymous, which means there is no way to verify their identity or their relationship with Chen Da Wen.
2. **Motivation**: The commenter might have a personal grudge or bias against Chen Da Wen, which could color their account of events.
3. **Lack of Verification**: There is no independent verification of the story. Without additional corroborating evidence or witnesses, it's difficult to confirm the accuracy of the events described.

### Contextual Considerations:
1. **Vetting Process**: The commenter mentions that Chen Da Wen passed the vetting process to become a police officer, which might seem surprising given the described incident. However, vetting processes can be rigorous but are not infallible.
2. **Character Assessment**: The commenter suggests that Chen Da Wen has "some character issues," which could be a subjective judgment. It's possible that Chen Da Wen has improved or that the incident was an isolated event.

### Conclusion:
While the story is detailed and consistent, it should be approached with caution due to the anonymity of the commenter and the lack of independent verification. It's possible that the incident occurred as described, but it's also possible that the commenter has a personal bias or is exaggerating the events. Without additional evidence or corroboration, it's difficult to definitively buy the story. [end of text]
