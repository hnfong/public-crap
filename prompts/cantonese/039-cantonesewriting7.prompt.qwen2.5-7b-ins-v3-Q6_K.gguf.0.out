Alright, I need to translate the story of "Three Little Pigs" into Cantonese. First, I'll recall the main elements of the story: three pigs building houses, the big bad wolf trying to blow them down, and the different outcomes based on the materials used. I should ensure that the dialogue and phrases are authentic in Cantonese, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar structures. Maybe I should also consider cultural nuances that might make the story resonate better with Cantonese speakers. Additionally, I need to maintain the original moral or lesson of the story, such as the importance of hard work and choosing the right materials. Perhaps I can add some local references or idiomatic expressions to make it more relatable. Oh, and I shouldn't forget the classic ending where the cleverest pig uses his wits to outsmart the wolf. Let me start drafting the story, making sure to use the correct Cantonese syntax and vocabulary throughout.

三隻小豬，一隻用泥巴建屋，一隻用竹子建屋，一隻用磚頭建屋。泥巴屋最易被大野狼吹倒，竹子屋次之，磚頭屋最堅固。大野狼吹倒泥巴屋，吃掉小豬，但吹不倒磚頭屋。小豬用火燒大野狼，救出同伴，三隻小豬一起快樂地生活。
