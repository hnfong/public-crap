<Thought>
Alright, I need to translate this conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English. Let's see, Alice starts with "hah." and "yeh. me 2." which seems like casual greetings. She mentions she likes to play a lot but never gambles. Bob responds by saying he never gambles on Big2 either, except for a time a few weeks ago. Then Alice asks about that time, and Bob explains he went to a friend's house, wanted to play Big2, and his friend charged 1 cent per card because he's good at it. Alice seems a bit skeptical and mentions she wouldn't mind losing up to $10. She then talks about how it's good but warns that if someone gambles too much, they wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly. Bob agrees that it's not very good to "stand so hard" and mentions that gambling can be stressful. He also asks if Alice has the program they need. Alice responds that she doesn't have the program and that she needs to download or something. Bob then explains that to play online, they need a program, and his client doesn't support file transfers yet, so he suggests getting it from him via FTP or HTTP. Alice seems confused and responds with "hoe ark." and "ng goi sai," which might be her way of saying she doesn't understand or is unsure.

Overall, the conversation revolves around their preferences for playing games like Big2, their experiences with gambling, and the technical aspects of playing online, including the need for specific programs and file transfer methods.

**Alice:**
Hah.
Yeah. Me too.
I like to play a lot, but I never gamble.
:)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either.
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud Ah?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
I said, "Let's play."
He said 1 cent for a card... because he's really good at it.
I thought, "So hing"...
Besides, I might lose up to $10.

**Alice:**
I see.
:)
Hehe. Let's get you to play more.
It's actually good.
But if you gamble too much, you wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to "stand so hard"...
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
Meh, program.
Maybe I need to download or something.
:)

**Bob:**
Okay, to play online, you need a program to play.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet.
Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP...
Wait...

**Alice:**
Hoe ark.
:)
Not sure.
Hehe
