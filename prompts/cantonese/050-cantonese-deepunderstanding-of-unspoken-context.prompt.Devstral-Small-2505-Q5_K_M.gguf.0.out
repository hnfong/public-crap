**Overview of the Situation:**

The person in the paragraph is likely a young individual who has been struggling to find a job. He is aware of the current job market where many young people are also facing difficulties in securing employment. He mentions that companies are using cash incentives to attract job seekers, which implies that the job market is competitive and that many positions may not be appealing without such incentives.

**Problems Encountered:**

1. **Lack of Experience and Education:** The person acknowledges that he lacks both experience and formal education, which are crucial for securing a job in a competitive market.
2. **Low Wages and Poor Working Conditions:** He mentions that even if someone is hired, the job may be low-paying and have poor working conditions, with little room for career advancement.
3. **Market Saturation:** The job market is saturated with many job seekers, making it difficult for individuals like him to stand out.

**Conclusion:**

The person concludes that the reason companies are having trouble finding employees is not just because their offers are not attractive enough, but because there is a fundamental issue with the job seekers themselves. He suggests that many people, including himself, have poor conditions and lack the necessary qualifications to be hired.

**Agreement with the Conclusion:**

While it is true that the job market can be challenging for those without experience or education, the conclusion that the problem lies solely with the job seekers is overly simplistic. The job market is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, industry demands, and company policies. It is also important to consider that many companies may not be offering competitive wages or good working conditions, which can deter potential employees.

In summary, while the person's situation is understandable, the conclusion that the problem is solely with the job seekers is not entirely accurate. The job market is a complex system influenced by multiple factors, and both employers and job seekers have roles to play in addressing these challenges. [end of text]
