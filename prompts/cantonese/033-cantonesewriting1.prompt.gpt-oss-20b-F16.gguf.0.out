<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce 10 sentences in Cantonese using the word "銀包" (wallet). Each sentence should be in Cantonese grammar, using Cantonese spelling: e.g., "嘅" instead of "的", "係" instead of "是". Provide English translation for each sentence. Format similar to example: "# 詞: 銀包" then numbered sentences 1-10, each with Cantonese sentence and English translation in parentheses? The example shows each sentence followed by translation in parentheses. So we should follow that.

We need to ensure Cantonese grammar: use "嘅", "係", "唔" for not, "呢" etc. Use "銀包" as noun. Provide 10 sentences.

Let's craft sentences:

1. 我哋今晚要去酒吧，記得攞銀包，唔好忘記。 (We are going to the bar tonight, remember to bring your wallet, don't forget.)

2. 佢個銀包係黑色皮革，質感好好。 (His wallet is black leather, feels good.)

3. 你個銀包點樣？有幾多錢？ (How's your wallet? How much money does it have?)

4. 我哋要買新銀包，因為舊個已經破咗。 (We need to buy a new wallet because the old one is broken.)

5. 佢把銀包放喺包包入面，唔好亂放。 (He put his wallet inside the bag, don't put it randomly.)

6. 你見唔見我個銀包？我好似落咗喺車上。 (Did you see my wallet? I think I left it in the car.)

7. 佢個銀包入面有三張信用卡同埋一張身分證。 (His wallet contains three credit cards and an ID card.)

8. 我哋要小心，唔好畀人偷銀包。 (We should be careful not to let someone steal our wallet.)

9. 佢個銀包係銀色，閃閃發光，好靚。 (His wallet is silver-colored, shiny, very pretty.)

10. 你想唔想買個新銀包？我哋有好多款式。 (Do you want to buy a new wallet? We have many styles.)
