<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce 10 sentences in Cantonese using the word "銀包" (wallet). Each sentence should be in Cantonese, using Cantonese grammar, e.g., "嘅" instead of "的", "係" instead of "是". Then provide English translation. Format similar to example: "# 詞: 銀包" then numbered sentences 1-10, each with Cantonese sentence and English translation in parentheses? The example shows each sentence followed by translation in parentheses. So we should follow that.

We need to ensure Cantonese usage: "銀包" is a noun meaning wallet. Use Cantonese words like "我個銀包" etc. Provide 10 sentences.

Let's craft sentences:

1. 我個銀包係黑色，內部有十個卡位。 (My wallet is black, with ten card slots inside.)

2. 佢將銀包遺落喺巴士上，第二天就搵到。 (He left his wallet on the bus, and found it the next day.)

3. 你個銀包冇錢，點樣先可以買番啲飲品？ (Your wallet has no money, how can you buy drinks again?)

4. 佢用銀包收費，因為佢唔想用手機支付。 (He used his wallet to pay because he didn't want to use his phone.)

5. 我哋要保護銀包，唔好畀人偷。 (We need to protect our wallets, don't let people steal them.)

6. 佢買咗一個新銀包，因為舊個已經破咗。 (He bought a new wallet because the old one was broken.)

7. 你見過佢個銀包咩？我好想搵返佢。 (Have you seen his wallet? I want to find it.)

8. 佢把銀包放喺背包入面，方便攜帶。 (He put his wallet inside his backpack for convenience.)

9. 佢個銀包入面有一張信用卡同埋一張學生證。 (His wallet contains a credit card and a student ID.)

10. 佢話佢個銀包係佢最貴嘅財產。 (He said his wallet is his most valuable possession.)

Make sure to use Cantonese grammar: "係" for "is", "冇" for "doesn't have", "唔好" for "don't", "呢" maybe. Use "個" for classifier. Use "呢" maybe. Use "呢個" etc.
