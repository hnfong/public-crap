Alright, I need to create 10 example sentences in Cantonese using the word "暗諷" (āam6 yih6), which means "sarcasm" or "irony," followed by their English translations. First, I'll recall the usage of "暗諷" in different contexts to ensure the sentences are varied and natural. I'll consider everyday scenarios, conversations, and situations where sarcasm or irony is commonly used. Then, I'll translate each sentence into English, making sure the meanings are accurately conveyed while maintaining the tone and context of the original sentences.
