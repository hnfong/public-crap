The story is **partially believable**, but there are **some inconsistencies and red flags** that make it **suspicious**. Here's a breakdown of why:

---

### ‚úÖ **Plausible Elements:**
1. **Shared Work Experience**:  
   - The person claims to be a former colleague of the award-winning officer, and they worked together at a major international bank. This is **plausible**, especially in a city like Hong Kong where many people work in finance and law enforcement.

2. **Shadowing a New Hire**:  
   - It's common for new employees to shadow experienced colleagues during their first week. This detail adds **credibility** to the story.

3. **Disciplinary Action**:  
   - The story mentions the officer was caught "wearing a dirty shirt" (or "decayed shirt" ‚Äî possibly a mistranslation of "decayed" or "worn-out" clothing), which led to a complaint. This kind of minor infraction is **realistic** and could lead to disciplinary action.

4. **Reporting to Management**:  
   - The person claims the officer was told not to leave immediately after the incident, but the officer still left. This could lead to a formal complaint or investigation, which is **plausible**.

5. **Subsequent Career Change**:  
   - The officer later joined the police force. This is **possible**, though it's unusual for someone to switch careers so abruptly unless there was a significant reason.

### ‚ùå **Unlikely or Suspicious Elements:**
1. **"Decaying Shirt" as a Major Issue**:  
   - While workplace dress codes are important, being fired or disciplined for a **single incident of wearing a slightly worn shirt** is **extremely unlikely**, especially in a major bank. Banks typically have more serious reasons for termination, such as misconduct, fraud, or repeated violations.

2. **Immediate Arrest or Detention**:  
   - The story claims the officer was "detained" by security after being told not to leave. This is **highly unusual** unless the person was under suspicion of a serious crime. A minor dress code violation would not typically result in being "held" by security.

3. **"Vetting" as a Career Barrier**:  
   - The phrase "vetting" is used in the context of background checks for police or government jobs. However, the implication that the officer was **barred from becoming a police officer** because of a minor incident is **unlikely** unless there was a **much more serious issue**.

4. **Personal Branding**:  
   - The story paints the officer as someone with "personal issues" but doesn't specify what those are. This kind of vague criticism is often used to **discredit someone** without providing concrete evidence.

5. **Anonymous Posting**:  
   - The post is anonymous and appears on a forum, which makes it **hard to verify**. People often post such stories to **damage reputations** or express personal grievances.

### üßê **Possible Motivations:**
- **Personal Grudge**: The poster may have had a negative experience with the officer and is trying to **damage their reputation**.
- **Jealousy or Envy**: The officer received an award, and the poster may be **resentful**.
- **Misinformation or Misunderstanding**: The poster may have **misinterpreted** or **exaggerated** events.

---

### üìå **Conclusion:**
While the story contains **some realistic elements**, the **overall narrative is suspicious** due to:
- The **unusual severity** of the consequences for a minor dress code issue.
- The **implausible detention** by security.
- The **vague and negative personal branding** of the officer.
- The **anonymous nature** of the post.

**Verdict:**  
**I don't fully buy the story.** It seems more like a **personal attack** or **exaggerated account** rather than a factual recounting of events. If the officer truly had a serious issue that prevented them from becoming a police officer, there would likely be **more concrete evidence** or a **different tone** in the story.

If you're trying to verify this, you might want to:
- Look for **corroboration** from other sources.
- Check if the officer has a **public record** of disciplinary action.
- Consider the **source** and **tone** of the post. [end of text]
