Okay, let's break down this user's comment. They're talking about a person named Chan Tak Man, an outstanding police officer, and they claim to be his former colleague from a British-owned bank. The user says Chan was fired because he accidentally dropped a cash box, and his boss threatened to report him to the police if he didn't leave immediately. Then, the user mentions that Chan later joined the police force, but there are questions about his character and how he passed the vetting process.

First, I need to assess the credibility of this story. The user is presenting it as a personal account, but there are several red flags. The mention of a British-owned bank in Hong Kong might be a way to add authenticity, but without specific details, it's hard to verify. The story seems to be a narrative that serves a purpose, possibly to discredit Chan or highlight issues with the vetting process.

Next, I should consider the context. The user is commenting on a forum where Chan has been recognized as an outstanding police officer. The user's comment might be an attempt to challenge that recognition by suggesting that Chan's past behavior or character issues disqualify him. However, the user's account is anecdotal and lacks concrete evidence, such as names of the bank, dates, or official records.

I also need to think about the user's possible motives. They might be trying to stir controversy or express skepticism about the vetting process. The mention of Chan being fired and then joining the police could imply that the vetting process wasn't thorough enough. But without more information, it's speculative.

Another angle is the user's language. They use phrases like "點解我咁有佢印象?" which translates to "Why do I have such a strong impression of him?" This suggests that the user is emphasizing their personal connection to Chan, which might be intended to lend credibility to their story. However, personal anecdotes aren't always reliable, especially when they're used to make a point.

I should also consider the possibility that the user is mistaken or exaggerating. People often embellish stories, especially when recounting past events. The user might have conflated different incidents or misremembered details. For example, the story of being fired for dropping a cash box might be a mix-up with another event.

Additionally, the user's comment touches on the vetting process for police officers. If Chan was able to pass the vetting despite alleged character issues, it could raise questions about the effectiveness of the process. However, the user's account doesn't provide evidence to support this claim, so it's hard to assess the validity of that point.

In summary, the user's story is presented as a personal anecdote but lacks verifiable details. The credibility of the account is questionable due to the absence of specific information and the potential for embellishment. The user's intent might be to challenge Chan's recognition or to critique the vetting process, but without concrete evidence, the story remains unverified.

The story presented in the comment is anecdotal and lacks verifiable details, making it difficult to assess its credibility. Here's a breakdown of the key points and why the story may or may not be convincing:

### 1. **Anecdotal Nature**  
   - The comment is based on a personal account from the commenter, who claims to be a former colleague of Chan Tak Man. While personal stories can be compelling, they are subjective and often lack objective evidence (e.g., documents, witness accounts, or official records). Without corroborating details (e.g., the name of the bank, dates, or specific incidents), the story remains unverified.

### 2. **Suspicious Details**  
   - **"Fired for dropping a cash box":** The claim that Chan was fired for accidentally dropping a cash box and being threatened with a police report is unusual. Such incidents are typically handled internally (e.g., disciplinary action, suspension) rather than involving immediate threats of legal action. The story seems exaggerated or fabricated to emphasize Chan's "unprofessionalism" or "character flaws."
   - **"Vetting process":** The commenter questions how Chan passed the vetting process for becoming a police officer, implying potential misconduct. However, vetting processes are confidential and involve multiple checks (e.g., background investigations, interviews). Without evidence of wrongdoing or public records, this criticism is speculative.

### 3. **Possible Motives**  
   - The commenter may be attempting to discredit Chan's recent award or raise doubts about the integrity of the police force. However, this could also reflect personal bias, misunderstandings, or even misinformation. The story might be an attempt to stir controversy or highlight systemic issues, but it lacks concrete proof.

### 4. **Lack of Context**  
   - The comment does not provide context about Chan's subsequent career as a police officer, his achievements, or any official investigations into his conduct. Without this, the story serves more as a narrative than a factual account.

### Conclusion:  
The story is **unlikely to be credible** due to its reliance on unverified anecdotes, exaggerated claims, and absence of evidence. While personal experiences can offer insights, they should not be taken as definitive proof without further corroboration. If the commenter has additional details or evidence, they could strengthen their case, but as it stands, the story appears to be speculative or biased. [end of text]
