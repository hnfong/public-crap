<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "止蝕". Provide pos: noun? Could be verb phrase? In Cantonese, "止蝕" means "stop loss" (financial term). Could be noun "止蝕" (stop-loss) or verb "止蝕" (to stop loss). Provide explanation in Cantonese, English translation. Provide example sentence in Cantonese with romanization and English translation.

Format:

```
# 止蝕
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:...
eng:...
<eg>
yue:... (romanization)
eng:...
```

Make sure to use Cantonese grammar, not Mandarin. Use "嘅" etc. Provide romanization using jyutping.

Let's craft.

Explanation: "止蝕"係指喺投資或買賣時，為避免虧損擴大而設定嘅賣出或平倉價格/行動。亦可指「止蝕單」等。

English: "stop loss" – a trading strategy to limit loss by setting a price at which to sell/close a position.

Example: "佢喺股市入面設咗止蝕位，股價跌到$50就自動賣出。" Provide jyutping.

Let's produce.

Also include pos maybe "名詞/動詞"? Could list both: (pos:名詞/動詞). But format expects one. Could say (pos:名詞) as noun phrase.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 止蝕
