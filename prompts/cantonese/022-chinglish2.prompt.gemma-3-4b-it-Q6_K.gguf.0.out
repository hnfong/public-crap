Okay, here's a simple English translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob, broken down for clarity:

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play, it’s fun.
But I never gamble, okay?
:)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either. 😉
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago, Joe did what?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend’s house.
He wanted to play Big2.
He kept saying “Let’s play!”
He said you could bet just 1 cent per card... (because he’s really good at it).
So I said “Okay, let’s do it.” Besides, I only lost about $10.

**Alice:**
Okay, that’s good.
:)
Hehe. Don’t worry too much.
It’s actually pretty good. But if you have to bet a lot, I wouldn’t really enjoy playing.

**Bob:**
But it’s not good to be so stubborn about it. 😞
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
The program?
Just…
I don’t know how to get it for you.
:)

**Bob:**
Of course, you need a program to play online Big2! 😞
My client doesn’t support transferring files yet. Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... Wait...

**Alice:**
Okay, never mind.
:)
That’s fine.
Hehe

**Notes on the Translation & Cultural Context:**

*   **“Lor”:** This is a common Cantonese particle used to soften a statement, express agreement, or add a casual tone. It’s hard to translate directly, but I’ve used it where it seemed appropriate to convey a casual feeling.
*   **“Gum”:** This is a Cantonese word meaning “okay,” “so,” or “let’s do it.”
*   **“Hai”:** Means “have” or “to have.”
*   **“Hoe ark”:** Means “never mind.”
*   **“Lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai”:** This is a more complex phrase. It roughly translates to "Don't worry too much" or "It's okay."  "Lei gor" means "don't worry," "yuun" means "you," "doe" means "it," "gei" means "give," "moe sor" means "not bad," and "wai" is a particle adding a casual tone.
*   **“Stand so hard” (“Stand so hard”):** This refers to being overly cautious or unwilling to take a risk in the game.
*   **Big2:** This is a very popular card game in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

I've aimed for a clear and natural-sounding English translation while preserving the casual and slightly informal tone of the original conversation.  Do you want me to explain any part of the translation in more detail? [end of text]
