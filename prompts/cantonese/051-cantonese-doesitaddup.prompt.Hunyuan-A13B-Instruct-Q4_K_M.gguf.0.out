The story presented in the comment raises several concerns and questions, and whether one "buys" the story depends on how critically one evaluates the details and the plausibility of the narrative. Here's an analysis:

### Points in Favor of the Story:
1. **Specific Details**: The commenter provides specific details, such as the name "陳大文," the fact that the person was shadowing the commenter, and the circumstances of being terminated for "穿櫃桶底" (wearing the wrong shoes). These details add a sense of realism and specificity, which can make a story more convincing.

2. **Personal Connection**: The commenter claims to have known the individual as a former colleague at an English-language bank, which lends credibility to their account. The personal connection and shared experience make the story feel more authentic.

3. **Unusual Circumstances**: The story includes unusual and dramatic elements, such as the person being escorted out of the building by security and the subsequent decision to join the police force. These elements, while dramatic, are not entirely implausible.

### Points Against the Story:
1. **Lack of Evidence**: The commenter does not provide any concrete evidence to support their claims, such as documents, witness accounts, or official records. This makes it difficult to verify the story's accuracy.

2. **Questionable Motives**: The commenter's tone and phrasing suggest skepticism and judgment, which could indicate a personal bias against the individual. This raises questions about whether the commenter is sharing a genuine observation or venting personal frustration.

3. **Inconsistent Details**: The story contains some inconsistencies, such as the timeline of events. For example, the person is described as being terminated on the first day of work but later taking a job as a police officer. While this is not necessarily impossible, it would be helpful to have more context to understand the gaps.

4. **Cultural and Contextual Assumptions**: The story assumes that the person's behavior and personality issues were evident from the start and that these issues would have been discovered during the vetting process. However, it is unclear whether such issues would necessarily disqualify someone from becoming a police officer, as vetting processes can vary widely.

### Conclusion:
While the story is intriguing and detailed, it is not definitive proof of the individual's character or qualifications. Without additional evidence or context, it is difficult to fully verify the claims. The commenter's tone and lack of corroboration also raise questions about the reliability of the account. Therefore, while the story is plausible, it should be treated with caution and skepticism until more information is available.
