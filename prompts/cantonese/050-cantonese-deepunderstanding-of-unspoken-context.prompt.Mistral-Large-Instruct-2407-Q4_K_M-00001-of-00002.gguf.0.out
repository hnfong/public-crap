 ### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph is a job seeker who is frustrated with the current job market. He is observing that many young and attractive people are also struggling to find employment. He mentions that companies are using cash incentives to attract job seekers, but he questions the effectiveness of this strategy. He acknowledges that he lacks experience and education, which makes it difficult for him to find a job. He also notes that the job market is competitive, and even if he does find a job, it might be low-paying and have poor working conditions. Despite these challenges, he remains determined to find work, as he has been working since he was 13 years old and is not deterred by the difficulties.

### Problems He Has Run Into

1. **Lack of Experience and Education**: The person acknowledges that his lack of experience and education makes it difficult for him to find a job.
2. **Competitive Job Market**: The job market is saturated with many job seekers, making it harder to secure employment.
3. **Low-Quality Jobs**: Even if he finds a job, it might be low-paying and have poor working conditions.
4. **Cash Incentives**: He questions the effectiveness of companies using cash incentives to attract job seekers, implying that these incentives might not be enough to solve the underlying issues.

### Conclusion

The person concludes that the problem is not with the companies or the job offers but with the job seekers themselves, who may lack the necessary qualifications or have other issues that make them less employable.

### Agreement with the Conclusion

I partially agree with his conclusion. While it is true that job seekers need to improve their qualifications and skills to be more competitive in the job market, it is also important to acknowledge that the job market itself has structural issues. Companies offering low-quality jobs and using cash incentives as a primary attraction may not be addressing the root causes of unemployment. Additionally, the competitive nature of the job market and the lack of opportunities for those without experience or education are systemic problems that require broader solutions. Therefore, while individual job seekers should strive to improve their qualifications, there is also a need for systemic changes to create a more equitable and accessible job market. [end of text]
