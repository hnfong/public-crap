 ### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph is an individual who is currently struggling to find employment. He is observing that many young people (靚仔靚妹) are also having trouble finding jobs. He mentions that companies are using cash incentives (現金糧) to attract job seekers, but he questions the effectiveness of this strategy. He reflects on his own situation, noting that he lacks experience and education, which makes it difficult for him to find a job. He also mentions that the job market is competitive, and even if he does find a job, it might be low-paying and have poor working conditions. Despite these challenges, he has been working since he was 13 and is not deterred by these issues. He concludes that the problem is not with the companies but with the job seekers themselves, who may not have the necessary qualifications or skills.

### Problems He Has Run Into

1. **Lack of Experience and Education**: The individual acknowledges that he lacks the necessary experience and education to be competitive in the job market.
2. **Competitive Job Market**: There are many job seekers, making it difficult to secure employment.
3. **Poor Job Conditions**: Even if he finds a job, it might be low-paying and have poor working conditions.

### Conclusion

The individual concludes that the reason companies are having trouble filling positions is not because of a lack of job offers but because the job seekers themselves have issues, such as a lack of qualifications or skills.

### Agreement with His Conclusion

I partially agree with his conclusion. It is true that a lack of qualifications and skills can be a significant barrier to employment. However, it is also important to consider other factors such as the economic climate, the types of jobs available, and the effectiveness of the job search strategies being used. Companies may also need to reevaluate their hiring practices and consider offering training or development opportunities to help job seekers gain the necessary skills.

In summary, while the individual's personal circumstances and the competitive job market are significant factors, the problem is likely multifaceted and requires a more nuanced understanding. [end of text]
