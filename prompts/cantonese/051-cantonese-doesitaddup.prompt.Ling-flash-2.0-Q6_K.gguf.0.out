No, I don’t buy the story — at least not as presented. Here’s why:

### 1. **Suspicious Narrative Structure**
The story feels like a **deflection or justification**, especially given the context: the commenter is addressing a **recently awarded outstanding policeman**, yet instead of offering genuine praise, they're **digging into his past** with a negative anecdote. This timing and framing raise red flags.

### 2. **Vague and Unverifiable Claims**
- **"衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒"** – This translates to "got fired for breaking a toilet" or "sloppy/lazy and got fired." Such a claim is **extremely specific yet lacks detail**:
  - What exactly did he do? Was it truly a minor mistake?
  - Who is "老細" (boss)? Was this a legitimate firing or an overreaction?
- **"報官" (threaten to report to the police)** – This is a **serious accusation** that would normally involve legal consequences. Yet there's **no follow-up or evidence**.
- **"保安押住佢執野走"** – Suggests physical escort out, which implies a serious incident. But again, no details, no witnesses, no record.

### 3. **"人品有啲問題" but Still Passed Vetting?**
The commenter admits the person had "人品有啲問題" (personality issues or questionable character), yet managed to pass the vetting process ("過到vetting個關"). This contradiction is **illogical**:
- If someone truly had serious character flaws, especially involving dishonesty or misconduct, they likely wouldn’t pass police vetting.
- The commenter then says "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (doesn’t know how he passed), which sounds like **either**:
  - A **weak excuse** to deflect blame.
  - Or a **backhanded way of implying the system is flawed**, possibly to undermine the award.

### 4. **Possible Motive: Discredit the Awardee**
The timing — commenting on a post about someone receiving an **"outstanding policeman" award** — suggests the real intent is **not to share a story**, but to **cast doubt** on the awardee’s integrity. The story feels like **character assassination by anecdote**, with no evidence.

### 5. **Lack of Empathy or Constructive Critique**
Even if the story were true, the tone is **cynical and dismissive**, not reflective or constructive. There's no acknowledgment that the person improved or succeeded despite early setbacks — which is often part of a redemption arc. Instead, it's framed as "he was bad, but still got through, weird."

### 6. **Possible Fabrication or Exaggeration**
In online forums — especially in Chinese communities where slang and colloquialisms are used — such stories can be:
- **Fabricated** to smear someone’s reputation.
- **Exaggerated** to make a point.
- **Taken out of context** — maybe the person was fired for a minor mistake, but the commenter is painting it as a moral failing.

### Conclusion:
**No, the story is not credible as a legitimate critique.** It reads more like **an unsubstantiated attack** wrapped in a "he said/she said" anecdote, likely intended to **undermine the awardee’s credibility** rather than provide a balanced view of his career. The lack of evidence, logical inconsistencies, and timing all point to **motivated reasoning** rather than objective storytelling.

If this were a real concern, the commenter would likely:
- Provide more details (names, dates, context).
- Reference official records or legal outcomes.
- Avoid attacking someone publicly without substantiation.

Instead, this reads like **internet hearsay** — possibly well-intentioned, but more likely **trolling or character assassination**. [end of text]
