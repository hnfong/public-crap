## Alice:
hah.
yes. me too.
I really like to play [game name].
but I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I never gamble on big2 either ;-)
except for that time a few weeks ago

## Alice:
a few weeks ago Joe played?

## Bob:
He went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play big2.
I said play.
He said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well)
I said "so hing" (meaning I don't want to play).
Besides, at most I would lose something like $10.

## Alice:
You said that.
:)
Hehe. Let's go young people, don't get too greedy.
It's actually good. But if you gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
But it's not very good to "stand so hard"...
Yes, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
Meh, the program.
Maybe you can download it or something.
:)

## Bob:
I said play online because you need a program to play...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... Wait...

## Alice:
How are you?
:)
Not sure.
