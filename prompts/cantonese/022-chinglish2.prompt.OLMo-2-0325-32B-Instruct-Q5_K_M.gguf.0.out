Alice: Haha, me too. I love to play games a lot, but I never gamble.

Bob: Oh, I don't gamble on Big2 either. ;-) Except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: A few weeks ago, did Joe organize it?

Bob: I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2, so I agreed. He said 1 cent for a card because he plays very well. I thought, "What the heck," besides, at most, I'd lose something like $10 only.

Alice: That's good actually. :) But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

Bob: But it's not very good to be so stubborn about not gambling... Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful... By the way, do you have the program?

Alice: What program? No, I don't have it. Do I need to download something?

Bob: To play online, of course, you need a program to play. My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... Wait...

Alice: Okay, thanks. :)
