Okay, let's break down this forum comment and assess whether the story seems believable. Here's a translation and then a detailed analysis:

**Translation:**

"I was a former colleague of this outstanding new police officer, Chen Da Wen, at a British bank. Why do I remember him so vividly? Because he shadowed me for his first week on the job. He was fired because he was caught stealing from the cash drawers (literally 'wearing the bottom of the cash bin' - a euphemism for theft). His boss even told him to leave immediately or they would report him to the police. As a result, after lunch, senior management and security came down and escorted him out, taking his belongings. He then went on to take the police entrance exam. His character is questionable, I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

**Do I buy the story?  Probably not entirely, or at least, I'd be *very* skeptical.** Here's a breakdown of why, looking at the details and the context of police vetting:

**Reasons for Skepticism:**

*   **The Severity of the Allegation:** Being fired for theft, especially if it involved cash handling, is a *very* serious offense.  It's not something easily overlooked, particularly when applying for a position of trust like a police officer.  It's a major red flag.
*   **The Public Escort:** The detail about senior management *and* security escorting him out is significant.  Banks are very careful about how they handle terminations, especially those involving potential criminal activity. A public escort suggests a clear and documented reason for dismissal.  This would almost certainly be part of his employment record.
*   **Vetting Process:**  Police vetting (background checks) are *extremely* thorough. They go far beyond a simple criminal record check. They investigate employment history, financial records, associations, and often conduct interviews with former employers.  To pass vetting with a history of being fired for theft from a bank seems highly improbable.  They *specifically* look for honesty and integrity.  The commenter's question "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (I don't know how he passed the vetting process) is a key indicator of disbelief.
*   **The Specific Detail of "Wearing the Bottom of the Cash Bin":** This is a very specific and somewhat colorful way to describe stealing from a cash drawer. While it adds a level of detail that *could* be genuine, it also feels like it could be embellishment to make the story more dramatic.
*   **Motivation of the Commenter:** We don't know the commenter's motivation.  Could there be a grudge?  Is this person trying to discredit Chen Da Wen?  While the commenter claims to simply explain why they remember him, it's possible there's more to the story.
* **Award for Outstanding Policeman:** The fact that Chen Da Wen received an award for being an outstanding policeman makes the story even more questionable. It's hard to believe someone with a history of theft would be recognized for such an achievement.

**Possible Scenarios (and why the story might be partially true, but exaggerated):**

*   **Misunderstanding/Exaggeration:** Perhaps the theft wasn't as blatant as described. Maybe it was a minor discrepancy that was blown out of proportion.  The "wearing the bottom of the cash bin" could be a slang term for a smaller offense.
*   **Vetting Gaps:** While rare, it's *possible* there was a gap in the vetting process.  Perhaps the bank didn't fully disclose the reason for termination, or the vetting officers didn't dig deep enough.  (This is unlikely, but not impossible).
*   **Time Passed/Rehabilitation:** It's possible the incident happened a long time ago, and Chen Da Wen has demonstrably turned his life around. However, a serious offense like theft would still be a major concern.
* **False Accusation:** It's also possible the commenter is lying or misremembering events.



**Conclusion:**

I would take this story with a *huge* grain of salt. While it's possible there's some truth to it, the details surrounding the theft and the subsequent passing of the police vetting process make it seem highly improbable.  I'd want to see corroborating evidence before believing it.  It's likely either an exaggeration, a misunderstanding, or a deliberate attempt to discredit Chen Da Wen.  The commenter's own skepticism ("唔知點解會過到vetting個關") is the most telling part of the post.
