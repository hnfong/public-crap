We need to translate Chinglish phrases into Cantonese. The examples show that "Chinglish" is basically Cantonese but written down using (often non-standard) pronunciation. English is also code-mixed into it as is the habit of many Hong Kong people.

We need to translate each phrase. The phrases are:

1. gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah
2. ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?
3. mud yeah lei ga?
4. but yuu yat chai yum cha lah
5. gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu
6. farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga
7. yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok...
8. kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung
9. need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju
10. yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai

We need to translate each into proper Cantonese.

First, we need to understand the phonetic representation: It's basically Cantonese but using English letters to approximate the sounds. The "Chinglish" is a mixture of Cantonese and English. The examples:

- "nei ho" => "你好". So "nei" is "you", "ho" is "good". So "nei ho" is "你好". So the translation is straightforward: "nei" = "you", "ho" = "good". So "nei ho" => "你好".

- "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？". So "nei" = "you", "yau" = "have", "moe" = "not", "tai" = "see", "sing" = "song", "con" = "competition"? Actually "sing con" is "song competition". So "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？". So "yau" = "have", "moe" = "not", "tai" = "see", "sing" = "song", "con" = "competition". So "yau moe" = "have not". So "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？". So the translation is "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？".

Thus the translation is basically: "nei" = "you", "yau" = "have", "moe" = "not", "tai" = "see", "sing" = "song", "con" = "competition". So "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？".

Thus the translation is straightforward: we need to map each English word to its Cantonese counterpart.

But we need to be careful: The "Chinglish" is basically Cantonese but written down using (often non-standard) pronunciation. So the English words are approximations of Cantonese words. For example, "gor" might be "go" (like "go" as in "go to"?), "doe" might be "to"? Actually "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" is a phrase. Let's parse it.
