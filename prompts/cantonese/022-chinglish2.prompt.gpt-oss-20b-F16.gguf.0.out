<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate the conversation into simple English. The conversation is in a mix of English and some Chinese/English slang. We need to produce a simple English translation. Let's parse each line.

Alice: "hah. yeh. me 2. I like to play very much gah. but never gamble lor :)"

Simplify: "Haha. Yeah. Me too. I like to play a lot. But I never gamble."

Bob: "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" "except for that time a few weeks ago"

Simplify: "Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago."

Alice: "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?"

Simplify: "A few weeks ago, Joe was...?" Actually "joe mud ah?" maybe "Joe was drunk?" Not sure. Could be "Joe was drunk?" Let's interpret: "A few weeks ago, Joe was drunk?" But we can keep as "A few weeks ago, Joe was...?" Might be "Joe was drunk?" We'll translate as "A few weeks ago, Joe was drunk?" But we can phrase: "A few weeks ago, Joe was drunk?" We'll keep.

Bob: "went to a friends house he wanted to play big2 wor gum i say play lor gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good) gum I fai si 'so hing' la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..."

Simplify: "I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2. I said let's play. He said 1 cent per card (because he's very good). I said 'so what?' Besides, at most I'd lose about $10."

Alice: "gum yau hai :) hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor"

Simplify: "I didn't. :) He said something about something. It's actually good. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully."

Bob: "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga... yea if need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do u have the program?"

Simplify: "But it's not good to 'stand so hard'. Yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful. By the way, do you have the program?"

Alice: "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth :)"

Simplify: "No program. Maybe you can download it or something :)"

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..."

Simplify: "I don't play online because you need a program to play. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... wait..."

Alice: "hoe ark. :) ng goi sai hehe"

Simplify: "Okay. :) I will try. hehe"

We need to produce a simple English translation. Let's produce a cleaned up conversation.

We should keep the names Alice and Bob. Provide the translation. Let's produce a conversation with simple English.

We need to preserve the meaning but not the slang. Let's produce:

Alice: "Haha. Yeah. Me too. I really like playing, but I never gamble. :)"

Bob: "Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago."

Alice: "A few weeks ago, Joe was drunk?"

Bob: "I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2. I said let's play. He said 1 cent per card because he's very good. I said 'so what?' Besides, at most I'd lose about $10."

Alice: "I didn't. :) He said something about something. It's actually good. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully."

Bob: "But it's not good to 'stand so hard'. Yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful. By the way, do you have the program?"

Alice: "No program. Maybe you can download it or something :)"

Bob: "I don't play online because you need a program to play. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... wait..."

Alice: "Okay. :) I'll try. hehe"

But we need to keep the conversation as a translation. Let's produce a final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Alice:**  
Haha. Yeah. Me too. I really like playing, but I never gamble. :)

**Bob:**  
Oh… I never gamble on Big 2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe was drunk?

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend’s house. He wanted to play Big 2. I said “let’s play.” He said 1 cent per card (because he’s very good). I said “so what?” Besides, at most I’d lose about $10.

**Alice:**  
I didn’t. :) He said something about something. It’s actually good. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game fully.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “stand so hard.” Yeah, if you need to gamble it’s very stressful. By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
No program. Maybe you can download it or something :)  

**Bob:**  
I don’t play online because you need a program to play. My client doesn’t support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP… wait…

**Alice:**  
Okay. :) I’ll try. hehe [end of text]
