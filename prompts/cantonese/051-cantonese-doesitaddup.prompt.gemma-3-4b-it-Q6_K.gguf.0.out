Okay, let's break down this comment and assess whether it's believable. **I do *not* buy the entire story as presented, but I think there's a kernel of truth to it, and the commenter is likely trying to expose a problematic situation.** Here's a detailed explanation:

**What the Comment Says:**

* **Identity:** The commenter identifies himself as a former colleague, Chen Da Wen (陳大文), of the recipient of the award.
* **Shared Experience:** They worked together for a year at a multinational bank.
* **The Core Story:** Chen Da Wen was fired from the bank within a week of starting due to incompetence – specifically, he couldn't even operate a trash can. His boss threatened to report him to authorities if he didn't leave immediately.
* **The Intervention:** The commenter directly intervened, helping to escort Chen Da Wen out of the building and ensuring he didn't cause further disruption.
* **Vetting Concerns:** The commenter expresses serious doubts about Chen Da Wen’s character, suggesting he failed a vetting process for the police force.

**Why I'm Skeptical (and where the embellishment likely lies):**

* **The Trash Can Incident is Overly Specific & Dramatic:**  The detail about a *trash can* is incredibly specific and feels deliberately chosen to be shocking. It’s a very minor, almost comical, reason to be fired from a bank. It’s a classic example of a detail designed to make a story more memorable and potentially cynical. It feels like the commenter is trying to paint a picture of utter incompetence.
* **The Boss's Threat is Exaggerated:** While bosses *can* threaten reporting, the phrasing "報官，結果下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走" (report him, and the result was that I came back from lunch after noon, and with security, we chased him to collect his things) is a bit melodramatic. It suggests a very forceful and immediate action, which is unlikely in a typical bank dismissal.
* **The "Vettting Failed" Claim is a Strong Assertion:**  Saying he "failed vetting" is a significant claim.  Police vetting processes are rigorous, and it's unusual for someone with such a glaring weakness to pass.  It’s possible, but it feels like the commenter is using this as a way to explain why Chen Da Wen received an award – to highlight the improbability of it.

**Where There Might Be Truth (and why the commenter is likely motivated):**

* **The Shared Experience:** The commenter *did* work with Chen Da Wen. This establishes a foundation of reality.
* **Incompetence/Lack of Preparedness:** It's plausible that Chen Da Wen was genuinely lacking in basic skills or preparedness for the job.  Even if the trash can incident was an exaggeration, there could have been other issues.
* **Motivated Disclosure:** The commenter's tone is highly critical and suspicious. He’s not simply sharing a story; he’s expressing concern about the award and suggesting it’s undeserved.  He’s likely trying to expose a potential problem with the police force's selection process.  He's using the embarrassing story of Chen Da Wen to question the validity of the award.

**Conclusion:**

The commenter is likely exaggerating the details of the trash can incident and the boss's threat to create a more impactful narrative. However, there's a reasonable basis for believing that Chen Da Wen was not well-prepared for the job and that the commenter witnessed this firsthand. The commenter's primary motivation is likely to raise concerns about the award and the vetting process, not simply to share a funny anecdote.

**In short:  The story is probably embellished, but the underlying concern about Chen Da Wen's suitability for the police force is likely genuine.**
