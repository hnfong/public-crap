**Alice:**
Haha. Yeah, me too. I really like to play a lot. But I never gamble. :)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either... except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? Did Joe rip you off?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two. So I said okay. Then he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well). So I just thought, "Sure, why not?" Besides, at most I’d lose something like $10...

**Alice:**
That makes sense. :) Hehe. Your luck is actually pretty bad. It's good actually. But if I absolutely had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so stubborn... Yeah, if you have to gamble it's very stressful... By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program? No. Do I need to download something? :)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online you obviously need a have a program... My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

**Alice:**
Oh, I see. :) Thank you. Hehe. [end of text]
