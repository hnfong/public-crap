Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:

I like to play very much.
but never gamble lol
:)

## Bob:
oh... I never gamble on big2 either ;-)
except for that time a few weeks ago

## Alice:
a few weeks ago? what happened?

## Bob:
went to a friend's house
he wanted to play big2
I said let's play
he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well)
I said "so cheap"... besides, at most lose like $10 or so...

## Alice:
that's cheap
:)
hehe. we played for a few months
it's good actually. but if you don't gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lol

## Bob:
but it's not very good to "stand so hard" lol...
yea if need to gamble it's very stressful...
btw, do you have the program?

## Alice:
my program.
no
I don't have it or something
:)

## Bob:

## Alice:
