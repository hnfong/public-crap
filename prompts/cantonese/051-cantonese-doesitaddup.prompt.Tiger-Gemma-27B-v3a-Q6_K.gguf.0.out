The story is highly plausible, but should be taken with a grain of salt until verified. Here's why:

*   **Specific Details:** The commenter provides specific details (working at a British bank, shadowing for a week, being fired for theft, being escorted out by security) that make the story feel more credible than a vague accusation.
*   **Internal Knowledge:** The commenter claims to be a former colleague, suggesting they had access to inside information about the policeman's past.
*   **Plausible Career Path:** It's not uncommon for people who have been fired from one job to seek employment in another field, including law enforcement.
*   **Vetting Concerns:** The commenter raises a valid question about how someone with a questionable past could pass police vetting procedures.

However, the story could still be false:

*   **Personal Grudge:** The commenter may have a personal vendetta against the policeman and is spreading false information to damage his reputation.
*   **Exaggeration or Misinterpretation:** The commenter may be exaggerating the details or misinterpreting the events that led to the policeman's dismissal.
*   **Lack of Proof:** The story is based solely on the commenter's word, with no supporting evidence.

Without independent verification, it's impossible to say for sure whether the story is true. [end of text]
