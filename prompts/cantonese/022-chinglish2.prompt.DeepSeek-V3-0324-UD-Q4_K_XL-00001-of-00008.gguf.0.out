Here’s the conversation translated into simple English:

---

### **Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing games, but I never gamble.  
:)  

### **Bob:**  
Oh… I don’t gamble on Big2 (a card game) either ;)  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.  

### **Alice:**  
What happened a few weeks ago?  

### **Bob:**  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, so I agreed.  
He said we’d bet 1 cent per card (because he’s really good).  
I thought, "Fine, whatever—at most, I’d lose around $10."  

### **Alice:**  
Haha, I see.  
:)  
You’re usually quite careful with money, right?  
It’s good, actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

### **Bob:**  
But being too strict isn’t great either…  
Yeah, gambling makes it stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?  

### **Alice:**  
What program?  
No.  
Do I need to download something?  
:)  

### **Bob:**  
Well, if you play online, you need the program to play.  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP… Wait…  

### **Alice:**  
Oh, okay.  
:)  
Thanks a lot!  
Hehe.
