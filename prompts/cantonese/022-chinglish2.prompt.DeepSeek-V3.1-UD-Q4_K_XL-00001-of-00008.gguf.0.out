Of course! Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

**Alice:**  
Ha ha.  
Yes, me too.  
I like playing games a lot.  
But I never gamble.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don't gamble when I play Big Two either ;-)  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago? What happened?

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big Two.  
So I said, "Okay, let's play."  
Then he said we should bet one cent for each card... (because he is very good at the game)  
So I thought, "That's okay"... besides, the most I could lose was about $10...

**Alice:**  
I see.  
:)  
Hehe. You are quite easy-going.  
It's good actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game completely.

**Bob:**  
But it's not very good to be too strict about it...  
Yes, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program (to play the game)?

**Alice:**  
What program?  
No.  
Do I need to download it or something?  
:)

**Bob:**  
Well, to play online you of course need a program to play...  
My chat client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

**Alice:**  
Okay.  
:)  
Thank you very much.  
Hehe. [end of text]
