## Rewritten Essay:

Three hours ago, I finished work and went home to browse the internet, and saw people mourning #Yu Ying-shih. At the time, I only knew he was an idol of blogger #Wang Weixiong, and knew nothing else about his life.

But in the 21st century, you don’t always have to ask #teachers for everything. Google knows all. After some searching, I began to understand why he was so famous, and why Professor Wang mentioned him so often…

Old Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive! Just that reputation is intimidating enough!

I acted like a stalker, constantly digging into Yu Ying-shih’s background: how did Chinese Wikipedia write about him, how did English Wikipedia write about him, how did people praise him when he won awards, and how do obituaries speak of him today? A person I deeply respect came to mind… Yun Gen, my teacher. They really are similar!

Unfortunately, Yun Gen doesn’t have a professorship at Harvard, but their #extensive knowledge of history and #my-understanding-of-Chinese-culture are definitely from the same school of thought. Yun Gen likes Daoism and Buddhism, while Old Yu seems to be a fan of Confucianism.

But that’s a shame.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness, hierarchical order, and ruler-subject relationships. But if you study at a top American university, having earned a PhD during the height of the hippie movement, are you really supposed to go around teaching everyone to #respect-teachers and not engage in so much #individualism? That wouldn’t work.

To put it another way, how a scholar avoids being naive is the knowledge Confucius gained through a lifetime of hardship. Confucian students couldn’t possibly be unaware of this: in Confucius’s time, the country was on the verge of chaos, and he traveled the states hoping to find an official position and make a difference. But he only knew how to recite books and talk about the rites of Zhou, and didn’t know how to cater to the needs of his superiors, ultimately failing. But failure is the mother of success, and his students improved greatly. As Sima Qian said: “The seventy disciples of Confucius dispersed to various states, the greatest becoming ministers and advisors, the lesser becoming teachers and scholars.” Why?

Because through generations of transmission, they began to learn how to read their rulers’ expressions. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with rulers were already different, with conversation and laughter, knowing how to #flatter-superiors: “King Qi, I see you can’t even bear to kill an ox, you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the Way, and you will succeed!”

By the late Warring States period, “Confucian” strategists were playing a “ruler interview” game. To get an official position, they abandoned “benevolence” and “propriety,” and everyone went to study “the rule of law,” a new technology. So Xunzi, as a Confucian student, could educate students who became high-ranking officials in the Qin Dynasty government. You wouldn’t smell a trace of Confucius’s spirit in Li Si.

Today, with over a hundred countries in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than in the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leaving China, this (ancient) land of ritual, and going to the barbaric land of American military superpower, are they really supposed to take out the *Analects* and tell people to #mourn-for-three-years? Everyone is familiar with how miserably Confucius and his students were treated when they were ignored. So, when they go to America, Confucian students naturally say that the Master would support #democracy, #democracy-is-great, and the Communist Party is terrible. That’s how you get an Ivy League professor!

Someone might ask: aren’t there consequences for talking nonsense? Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and Confucian tradition was smashed to pieces during the #May-Fourth-Movement. As the only superpower after World War II, the academic authority of top universities might even believe you if you said Johnny Kung taught people to do drugs and sleep around. After all, America’s #theoretical-nuclear-weapons are the real deal, and everyone remembers the consequences of Japan not believing in them.

So why could Old Yu casually translate a few passages from the *Book of Han* into English and get a PhD, and why did several universities hire him as a professor? #You-know-what-I-mean. Pushing you onto a pedestal as an authority is to make you sincerely say: “Everyone here is a fool, you think Confucian thought is feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, he was a champion of democracy! If you don’t have a Harvard professorship, just listen to me!”

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy? Honestly, “sinologists” don’t understand this. You say: the Republic of China is an example. Hey, is Taiwan’s political system really “Confucian”? Do the KMT bosses spend their days attacking Tsai Ing-wen? Does Confucianism work like that? Does Tsai Ing-wen perform elaborate rituals and sacrifices? No. Scientific spirit, not being a charlatan, violates the principles of Confucianism. Do you think using Chinese characters means you’re Confucian? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least, they’re the most similar to Confucianism among advanced countries): rulers emphasize ritual and decorum, power is bestowed by heaven, supreme and unquestionable, everyone is in a hierarchy, and there’s no challenging the order, which stabilizes society. As for the successes and failures of their democratic systems, that’s not something a Chinese-American has the right to comment on.



## Commentary:

Disregarding the extremely sarcastic and often inflammatory tone, the author’s main point is a critique of how Confucianism is *presented* and *adapted* when it’s exported to Western academic settings, specifically the United States. 

The author argues that Confucianism, with its emphasis on hierarchy, ritual, and ruler-subject relationships, is fundamentally at odds with the individualistic and democratic values of modern America. However, to gain acceptance and credibility in that environment, scholars like Yu Ying-shih are incentivized to reinterpret Confucianism as being compatible with, and even supportive of, democracy. 

The essay details a cynical view of this process, suggesting that scholars are forced to “perform” a certain version of Confucianism that caters to Western expectations, even if it means distorting its original meaning. The author uses historical examples to illustrate how Confucianism has always been adaptable and pragmatic, shifting its focus to suit the needs of those in power.  The implication is that the “Confucianism” taught in American universities is a diluted, politically motivated version, designed to be palatable rather than authentic.

The author isn’t necessarily arguing *against* Confucianism itself, but rather against the *way* it’s being presented and understood in a foreign context. They highlight the pressures and compromises scholars face when navigating different cultural and political landscapes, and the potential for intellectual dishonesty in the pursuit of academic success and recognition.  The repeated use of phrases like "#You-know-what-I-mean" and the overall mocking tone suggest a deep frustration with what the author perceives as a superficial and misleading portrayal of a complex philosophical tradition.  The essay is a commentary on the politics of knowledge and the challenges of cross-cultural understanding.
