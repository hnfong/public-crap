I need to create a dictionary entry for "止蝕" in Cantonese, following the format used for "溜冰場." The entry should include a part of speech, an explanation in both Cantonese and English, and example sentences. I’ll use the correct Cantonese grammar, like "嘅" instead of "的" and "係" instead of "是." I should also include the pronunciation and romanization, ensuring the examples are clear and relevant to the context of trading or finance.
