This story raises several red flags and inconsistencies that make it difficult to accept at face value, especially given the context of the person being awarded for being an outstanding police officer. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Character and Background Check**: Police forces, especially in jurisdictions with high standards, conduct thorough background checks (vetting) on potential recruits. If the person had a significant issue at a previous job, such as being fired for a serious misconduct, it would likely have been uncovered during the vetting process. The fact that the person passed the vetting suggests that the story might be exaggerated or fabricated.

2. **Professional Conduct**: The story describes a very dramatic and public termination, with the person being escorted out by security. Such an event would likely leave a significant mark on the person's employment history and could be easily verified. If this were true, it would be difficult for the person to secure a position in law enforcement, where trust and integrity are paramount.

3. **Character Witness**: The commenter claims to be a former colleague, but the story is presented in a very detailed and dramatic way, which could be an attempt to sensationalize the situation. If the person truly had issues, it would be more common for the story to be more subdued and focused on specific, verifiable incidents rather than a highly emotional and detailed narrative.

4. **Motivation**: The commenter's motivation for sharing this story is unclear. If the person is genuinely a former colleague, they might have a personal grudge or agenda. It's important to consider the source of the information and whether there might be any bias or ulterior motives.

5. **Lack of Evidence**: The story lacks concrete evidence or corroboration. Without additional sources or documentation, it's difficult to verify the claims. In a professional setting, especially one involving law enforcement, there would typically be some form of record or documentation of such a significant event.

6. **Context of the Award**: The fact that the person received an award for being an outstanding police officer suggests that they have demonstrated exceptional performance and integrity in their role. This award would not be given lightly, and the vetting process would have been rigorous.

In conclusion, while it's possible that the story has some elements of truth, the dramatic and detailed nature of the narrative, combined with the lack of concrete evidence and the person's subsequent success in law enforcement, make it difficult to accept the story as entirely accurate. It's important to approach such claims with a critical and skeptical eye, especially when they conflict with the official recognition and achievements of the individual. [end of text]
