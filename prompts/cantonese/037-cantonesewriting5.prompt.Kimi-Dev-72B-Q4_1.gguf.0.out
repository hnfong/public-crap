◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create 10 example sentences in Cantonese using the term "睇怕" and then translate them into English. First, I need to understand what "睇怕" means. From my knowledge, "睇怕" (dai6 paai3) in Cantonese is a phrase that can mean "to look down on" or "to despise" someone. So, the sentences should reflect situations where someone is looking down on another person.

Now, I need to structure each sentence properly in Cantonese grammar. For example, the subject comes first, followed by the verb "睇怕", then the object. Also, I should use appropriate particles and structures. Let me think of different contexts where "睇怕" might be used.

First example: Maybe a parent looking down on their child for not doing well in school. The sentence could be "阿爸成日睇怕我，話我唔會讀書。" (My dad always looks down on me, saying I can't study.)

Another example: A boss despising an employee. "老細成日睇怕阿明，覺得佢唔中用。" (The boss always looks down on Ah Ming, thinking he's useless.)

What about a friend situation? "佢哋成班人睇怕我，唔理我。" (They all look down on me and ignore me.)

Or a historical context: "以前嘅人好睇怕女人，覺得佢哋應該留喺屋企。" (In the past, people looked down on women, thinking they should stay at home.)

Another one: "我唔鍾意你噉睇怕我，好傷心。" (I don't like you looking down on me like that; it's hurtful.)

Maybe a sports scenario: "佢哋隊長好睇怕新入隊嘅球員。" (Their team captain looks down on the new players.)

Or a teacher-student relationship: "個老師好睇怕成班人，成日批評。" (The teacher looks down on everyone, always criticizing.)

Another example: "我哋唔應該睇怕貧窮嘅人，佢哋都係人。" (We shouldn't look down on poor people; they are human too.)

And maybe a self-reflective one: "我以前好睇怕人，但家知道錯咗。" (I used to look down on people, but now I know it's wrong.)

Now, I need to make sure each sentence is grammatically correct in Cantonese. For instance, using "成日" (always) where appropriate, and the correct word order. Also, the translations should accurately reflect the meaning. For example, "睇怕" can be translated as "look down on" or "despise", depending on the context.

Once I have all 10 sentences, I'll list them with their English translations. Each line starts with the number, the Cantonese sentence in traditional characters, and then the English translation in parentheses. I need to ensure that the translations are accurate and capture the nuances of the original Cantonese phrases.
