## Alice:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play games, gah.
But I never gamble, you know.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I don't gamble on Big Two either. ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago with Joe, huh?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
So I said, let's play.
He said it would be one cent per card... (because he's really good at it).
And I thought, "so what," besides, at most I'd lose something like $10.

## Alice:
That's okay.
:)
Hehe. You're just playing for fun, right?
It's actually good. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
But it's not good to be so stubborn about it...
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
What program?
Oh,
do I need to download it or something?
:)

## Bob:
Well, to play online, of course, you need a program to play with...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... Wait...

## Alice:
Okay, got it.
:)
Thanks.
Hehe. [end of text]
