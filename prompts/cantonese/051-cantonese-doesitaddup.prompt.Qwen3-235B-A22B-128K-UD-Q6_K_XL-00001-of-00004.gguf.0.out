This story sounds **highly suspicious** and **unlikely to be true**. Here's a breakdown of why this comment is probably **not credible**:

---

### 1. **Contradiction in Character**
The comment claims to be from a former colleague of an **outstanding policeman**, yet immediately paints a negative picture of him:

- He was **fired** from a bank for **wearing a skirt** (衰穿櫃桶底 literally means "wearing a skirt to work").
- The boss threatened to **call the police** if he didn’t leave immediately.
- This contradicts the idea of him being an **outstanding policeman**, especially since police vetting processes in Hong Kong are **very strict**, particularly regarding **character, conduct, and past employment history**.

If someone were fired for such a reason (especially involving gender presentation or cross-dressing), and in such a dramatic way (escorted out by security), it would likely **raise red flags** during the vetting process for joining the police force.

---

### 2. **Unrealistic Police Vetting Process**
In Hong Kong, joining the police force involves a **rigorous background check**, including:

- Criminal record checks
- Credit history
- Previous employment verification
- Character references

If this person had been **fired under questionable or controversial circumstances**, especially involving **behavior that could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate**, it would be **very unlikely** that he could pass the vetting process and become a police officer — let alone an **outstanding** one who receives an award.

---

### 3. **Use of Slang and Dialect**
The comment is written in **colloquial Cantonese**, with phrases like:

- 我係 (I am)
- 點解我咁有佢印象 (Why do I remember him so well?)
- 衰穿櫃桶底 (wearing a skirt — literally “wearing a female uniform bottom”)

This kind of phrasing is typical of **online trolling or smear campaigns**, especially when someone wants to **discredit** a person in the public eye by spreading **rumors or sensational stories**.

---

### 4. **Lack of Specific Details**
The story lacks **verifiable details**, such as:

- Which bank?
- What year did this happen?
- What was his role at the bank?

Without these, it's impossible to confirm the story. This is a common trait of **fake or malicious comments**.

---

### 5. **Motivation to Discredit**
The comment appears on a forum where someone is being praised (陈大文 received an award as an outstanding policeman). The comment seems designed to:

- **Undermine** his credibility
- **Mock** his character
- **Create controversy**

This is a classic case of **character assassination** through **anonymous online comments**.

---

### Conclusion: **Do NOT buy the story**
This comment is likely:

- **A fabrication**
- **A smear tactic**
- **A trolling attempt**

Unless there is **official evidence** or **corroboration** from credible sources, this should be treated with **extreme skepticism**. The **Hong Kong police vetting process** is thorough enough that such a background issue would almost certainly prevent someone from becoming an officer, let alone receiving recognition.

If you're reading this on a forum, it's a good reminder to **be cautious about anonymous claims** and always **look for credible evidence** before believing or spreading such stories. [end of text]
