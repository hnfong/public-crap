Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Haha.
Yes. Me too.
I really like to play games.
But I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Yeah... I never gamble in Big 2 either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago? You're kidding?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big 2.
So I said let's play.
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays very well)
So I thought "whatever"... Besides, at most I'd lose like $10...

## Alice:
So you did gamble.
:)
Hehe. But if you gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game completely.

## Bob:
But it's not good to be so serious about it...
Yeah, if you have to gamble it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
What program?
No.
But you can download it or something.
:)

## Bob:
To play online you need a program to play with...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

## Alice:
Okay.
:)
Thanks.
Hehe. [end of text]
