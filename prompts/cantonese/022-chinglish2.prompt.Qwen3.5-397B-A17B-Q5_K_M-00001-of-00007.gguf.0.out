Here is the conversation translated into simple, standard English:

**Alice:**
Haha, yeah, me too. I really like playing games, but I never gamble. :)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either, ;-) except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? Did you lose money?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I agreed. Then he said it was one cent per card (because he plays very well). So I said, "That's too serious!" Besides, I figured I would lose at most about $10.

**Alice:**
That's true. :)
Hehe. You handled that situation well.
Actually, that's good. But if we had to gamble, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game fully.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so strict about it...
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it becomes very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program?
No, I don't.
Do I need to download it or something? :)

**Bob:**
Well, of course you need a program to play online.
My chat client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP. Wait a moment...

**Alice:**
Okay.
:)
No problem.
Hehe. [end of text]
