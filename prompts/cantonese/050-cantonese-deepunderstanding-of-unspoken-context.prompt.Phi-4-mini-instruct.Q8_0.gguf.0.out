The person in the paragraph appears to be a young individual, possibly in their early teens, who is frustrated with the job market. They are struggling to find a job that matches their qualifications and experience, which they feel are not sufficient. The person is also questioning why companies are only interested in candidates who can pay with cash, implying that they feel undervalued and overlooked.

The overall situation is that the person is facing difficulties in finding a job that suits their skills and experience. They are also questioning the fairness of the job market, where they feel that only those who can pay with cash are considered, leaving them feeling undervalued and overlooked.

I agree with the person's conclusion that the job market is unfair and that there are people who are struggling to find suitable jobs. It is important for companies to consider candidates based on their qualifications and experience, rather than their ability to pay with cash. The person is right to feel frustrated and undervalued in this situation, and it is important for society to address these issues and create a more fair and equitable job market. [end of text]
