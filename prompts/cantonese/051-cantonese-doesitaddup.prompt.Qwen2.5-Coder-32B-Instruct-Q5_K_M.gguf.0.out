The comment you provided seems to contain some inconsistencies and raises questions about the reliability of the information presented. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Initial Impression**: The commenter claims to have a strong impression of the individual, yet the details provided are quite specific and potentially exaggerated. For example, the mention of being shadowed in the first week and then being fired due to poor performance seems like a significant event that would be memorable, but the details are quite specific and could be embellished.

2. **Reason for Firing**: The reason given for the firing (being "衰穿櫃桶底" which roughly translates to being incompetent or lazy) is quite harsh and specific. It's unusual for someone to be fired in such a short period, especially if they were shadowed by a colleague, which usually indicates a period of training and adjustment.

3. **Threat of Reporting**: The comment mentions that the manager threatened to report the individual to the police if they didn't leave immediately. This is a serious allegation and would likely have significant consequences. It's unusual for a manager to make such a threat, and it would be a matter of public record if it were true.

4. **Transition to Police**: The commenter states that the individual then went on to become a police officer. This transition seems unlikely given the circumstances described. Typically, someone who is fired for poor performance would have difficulty passing a vetting process for a police position, which includes background checks, interviews, and assessments of character and fitness.

5. **Character Issues**: The commenter suggests that the individual has character issues and questions how they passed the vetting process. This is a serious accusation and would need substantial evidence to support it.

Given these points, the story seems to have some inconsistencies and may not be entirely reliable. It's possible that the commenter is exaggerating or misremembering details, or there might be other factors at play that are not mentioned in the comment. Without additional context or evidence, it's difficult to fully trust the account. [end of text]
