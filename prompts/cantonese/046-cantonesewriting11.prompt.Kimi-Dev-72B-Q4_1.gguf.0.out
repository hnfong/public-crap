◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a dictionary entry for the term "副簽" in Cantonese. The example given is for "溜冰場", so I need to follow that structure.

First, I need to understand what "副簽" means. In Chinese, "副" can mean deputy or assistant, and "簽" could be a signature or a document like a visa. So maybe "副簽" refers to a deputy signature or a co-signer. But I need to confirm the correct meaning in Cantonese.

Looking at the example, the structure is:

# 溜冰場
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink
<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

So the explanation part in Cantonese uses the term in a sentence fragment, and the example shows a complete sentence.

For "副簽", I need to find the correct Cantonese explanation. Let's think. In some contexts, "副簽" might be a co-signature, like when two people need to sign a document. Or maybe it's a secondary signature. Let's assume that "副簽" is a co-signer or a secondary signer.

So the explanation would be something like "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (someone who signs along with another). But maybe more accurately, "副簽" could be a deputy who signs on behalf of someone else. Or perhaps it's a co-signer in a financial context.

Alternatively, maybe "副簽" refers to a visa endorsement. For example, in some countries, a visa might have a "副簽" which is an additional stamp or note. But I'm not sure. Let me check.

Wait, in Mainland China, "副簽" might refer to a secondary visa, like when a group visa is issued, and each person gets a "副簽". But in Cantonese, perhaps it's used in a similar context. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So the explanation would be: "一种签证，通常是团体签证的副签" (a type of visa, usually a group visa's secondary part). But in Cantonese, that would be something like "一類簽證，通常係團體簽證嘅副簽".

But the user wants the explanation in Cantonese using the structure from the example. The example uses "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方", which is "a place for people to ice skate". So for "副簽", maybe it's "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the people who need to co-sign).

Alternatively, if "副簽" is a deputy signature, maybe "代替正簽人签名嘅人" (someone who signs on behalf of the main signer).

But I need to make sure the Cantonese grammar is correct. The example uses "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方", which translates to "a place for people to ice skate". The structure is "俾人" (let people) + verb + "嘅地方" (place). But for "副簽", perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, maybe "副簽" is a noun that refers to a co-signer. So the explanation could be "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two people who need to sign). In Cantonese, that would be "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人".

But how to structure that. Let's see. The example's explanation starts with "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方". The "#" is probably a placeholder for the term. So for "副簽", maybe the explanation would be "需要两个人#签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two people who need to # co-sign).

Wait, the example uses the term "溜冰場" in the explanation. So the explanation for "副簽" would include the term in a sentence fragment. Let's think. If "副簽" is a co-signer, then the explanation could be "两个人签名时其中一个人" (one of the two people signing), but how to structure that with the term.

Alternatively, maybe "副簽" is the act of co-signing. But the example is a noun, so perhaps "副簽" is a noun referring to a co-signer or a deputy signature.

Another approach: look for similar terms. For example, "正簽" might be the main signature, and "副簽" is the secondary. So the explanation could be "次要嘅簽名" (secondary signature) or "副手嘅簽名" (deputy's signature).

But I need to make sure the Cantonese is correct. Let's try to construct the explanation.

The user's example has "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方". The "#" is replaced by the term. So for "副簽", maybe the explanation is "两个人#签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two people who # co-sign). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "需要两个人签名，其中一个人係#副簽" (one of the two people signing is the # deputy signature).

But perhaps the correct explanation is "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two people who need to sign). So in Cantonese, that would be "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人".

But how to structure that. Let's break it down:

需要 (need) 两个人 (two people) 签名 (sign) 嘅 (的) 其中 (among) 一个人 (one person).

So the Cantonese would be "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人".

But maybe in Cantonese, the order is different. For example, "两个人签名需要嘅其中一个人".

Alternatively, maybe "两个人签名，其中一个人" (among the two people signing, one person).

But the example uses "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方". The structure is "俾人" (let people) + verb + "嘅地方". So for "副簽", perhaps the structure is different. Maybe "两个人签名时其中一个人" (one of the two people when signing).

Alternatively, maybe "副簽" is a noun that refers to a co-signer. So the explanation could be "两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two signers).

But I need to make sure the Cantonese grammar is correct. Let's try to write it as "两个人签名嘅其中一个人".

Now, the English translation would be "co-signer" or "secondary signer".

Next, the example sentence. The example for "溜冰場" is "溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。" (There are many kids in the ice skating rink.)

So for "副簽", maybe a sentence like "呢份合约需要正簽同副簽。" (This contract requires both the main signature and the co-signature.)

But I need to make sure the Cantonese is correct. Let's structure the example sentence.

In Cantonese, "呢份" (this document), "合约" (contract), "需要" (needs), "正簽" (main signature), "同" (and), "副簽" (co-signature).

So the sentence would be "呢份合约需要正簽同副簽。" (nei1 fan6 wu4 yao4 zeng3 gin3 tong4 fu6 gin3.)

The English translation would be "This contract requires both the main signature and the co-signature."

But maybe "正簽" and "副簽" are the people, not the signatures. So perhaps "正簽人" and "副簽人".

But the term is "副簽", so maybe it's the act or the person. Let's proceed with the example.

Putting it all together:

# 副簽
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:两个人签名嘅其中一个人（量詞：個）
eng:co-signer
<eg>
yue:呢份合约需要正簽同副簽。 (nei1 fan6 wu4 yao4 zeng3 gin3 tong4 fu6 gin3.)
eng:This contract requires both the main signature and the co-signature.

Wait, but the example uses "量詞：個", which is the classifier. So in the explanation, after the description, we need to specify the classifier. For "副簽" as a person, the classifier would be "個".

So the explanation line would be "两个人签名嘅其中一个人（量詞：個）".

But maybe "两个人签名" is not the right way. Let's think. If "副簽" is a co-signer, then the explanation could be "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人" (one of the two people who need to sign). So in Cantonese, that's "需要两个人签名嘅其中一个人".

But perhaps a better way is "两个人签名时其中一个人" (one of the two people when signing). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "副簽" refers to a visa endorsement. For example, in some cases, a visa has a "副簽" which is an additional stamp. But I'm not certain. If that's the case, the explanation would be different.

But given the information, I'll proceed with the co-signer interpretation.

So the final entry would be:

# 副簽
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:两个人签名嘅其中一个人（量詞：個）
eng:co-signer
<eg>
yue:呢份合约需要正簽同副簽。 (nei1 fan6 wu4 yao4 zeng3 gin3 tong4 fu6 gin3.)
eng:This contract requires both the main signature and the co-signature.

But wait, the example uses "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方". The "#" is replaced by the term. So in the explanation for "副簽", maybe the term should be included. For example, "两个人#签名嘅其中一个人".

But in the example, the term is "溜冰場", which is the place. So the explanation is "俾人溜冰場溜冰 嘅地方". Wait, no. The example's explanation is "俾人#溜冰 嘅地方". The "#" is replaced by the term. Wait, no. The term is "溜冰場", and the explanation is "俾人溜
