No, I do **not** buy this story—it contains multiple inconsistencies, implausible details, and likely misunderstandings or fabrications. Here's why:

---

### 1. **"學警" vs. "bank colleague" mismatch**
- **學警** (*student police officer*) refers to a trainee police officer undergoing training (typically 6–12 months) *before* becoming a sworn officer.
- The writer claims they worked with **Chen Dawen** at an *英資大行* (a major British investment bank), implying a professional corporate role—**not** a police trainee position.
- Police trainees (學警) do **not** hold full-time jobs at investment banks *before* joining the police force. If he was a *學警*, he would have been in training, not employed in banking.

✅ **Likely confusion**: The person may be referring to **陳大文 as a regular police officer** (not a *學警*), or the writer misremembered/misrepresented his title.

### 2. **"衰穿櫃桶底" → "broke the cash register"?**
- The phrase **"衰穿櫃桶底"** is colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese, literally meaning *"bad luck broke the cash register barrel bottom"*—a humorous euphemism for causing a major financial loss (e.g., misplacing cash, forging records, or embezzlement).
- But claiming someone was **"fired on the spot, and the boss threatened to report to police—then police arrived that afternoon to escort him out"** is highly implausible:
  - In reputable banks, termination for serious misconduct (e.g., theft) *does* involve security, but **police involvement on the same day**—especially *before* any formal complaint or investigation—is extremely rare.
  - Police do **not** routinely "escort someone out" of a bank *just* because of internal suspicion. That would require a *criminal report*, *arrest warrant*, or *ongoing investigation*—none of which are mentioned.

---

### 3. **"下晝我食完中午返嚟... 警察就落嚟押住佢執野走"**
- Timeline issue: If he was fired in the morning, why would police arrive *after lunch*? Unless the bank filed a police report *immediately* and police acted within ~2 hours (possible but unlikely without evidence), this sounds exaggerated.
- More likely: The person was dismissed for misconduct, but **no criminal charges were filed**—or if they were, the story oversimplifies or dramatizes it.

---

### 4. **"老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官"**
- This implies the manager threatened to call police *if he didn’t leave immediately*—a coercive tactic, but again, **banks don’t usually threaten criminal charges as leverage in internal dismissals**, especially without evidence. That could even expose the bank to legal risk (e.g., false accusation).

---

### 5. **"點解會過到vetting個關?"**
- The writer questions how he passed police vetting *despite* having a questionable background (i.e., being fired for suspected theft).
- But here’s the key:  
  ✅ **A past dismissal (even for misconduct) does *not* automatically disqualify someone from police recruitment**, especially if:
  - No criminal conviction resulted (e.g., no court case, no guilty plea).
  - The incident was minor, or time has passed.
  - He demonstrated rehabilitation (e.g., community service, stable employment since).
- Hong Kong Police vetting (*background check, character assessment, financial review, psychological evaluation*) is rigorous—but not impossible to pass after a single, non-conviction incident, especially if disclosed and explained.

---

### 6. **Possible Motivations for the Story**
- **Gossip or resentment**: The writer may be trying to discredit Chen, especially if he received an award while the writer feels overlooked.
- **Misremembering**: Confusing a *police officer* with a *bank employee*, or mixing up timelines.
- **Satire/exaggeration**: Some forum posts use hyperbole for effect (e.g., "police arrived that afternoon" = dramatic flair, not literal truth).

---

### Conclusion:
The story is **unlikely to be fully accurate**. While Chen Dawen *may* have had a problematic past in banking, the narrative contains red flags: timeline implausibility, overstatement of police involvement, and confusion about police recruitment terminology (*學警* ≠ bank employee).  
**It’s more plausible** that he was dismissed from banking for misconduct (no conviction), later rebuilt his life, and successfully passed police vetting—hence the award.

> 🔍 **Tip**: In Hong Kong, public service awards (e.g., *Police Medal for Meritorious Service*) require strict vetting. If Chen truly had a serious criminal record, he wouldn’t have been appointed—let alone recognized. So unless there’s evidence of corruption or fraud in the vetting process itself, the award suggests he *did* overcome past mistakes.
