◁think▷Okay, let's try to figure out if this story is believable. The user is commenting about a person named Chen Dawen who received an award as an outstanding police officer. The user claims to be a former bank colleague of Chen. 

First, the user says that Chen was fired from the bank because he made a mistake that caused a loss (穿櫃桶底), and the boss threatened to report him to the police if he didn't leave immediately. Then, in the afternoon, security came to escort him out. After that, Chen went on to become a police officer.

The key part here is the user's doubt about how Chen passed the vetting process to become a police officer despite having a problematic past. The question is whether this story is plausible.

Let me think about the steps involved. In many countries, police officers undergo a thorough background check during their vetting process. If someone was fired from a bank under such circumstances, especially with a threat of police involvement, that might show up in their background check. However, there are a few possibilities:

1. Maybe the bank didn't report the incident to the police, so there's no criminal record. The user mentioned that the boss said they would report if he didn't leave, but perhaps they didn't actually follow through. So Chen's record might be clean.

2. The police vetting process might not have access to certain employment records, especially if the bank didn't report it. So even if Chen was fired, if there's no police report or criminal conviction, the vetting might not catch it.

3. Alternatively, maybe Chen's application to the police force was before the incident, but that seems less likely given the timeline described.

Another angle: the user might be exaggerating or fabricating the story. Maybe they have a grudge against Chen and are trying to smear his reputation. But the user claims to be a former colleague, so if their account is true, it's possible.

But how common is it for someone with a problematic employment history to become a police officer? It depends on the severity of the offense. If the bank incident was a minor mistake without any criminal activity, then maybe it's possible. But if there was fraud or theft involved, that would be a problem.

The user's comment is in a forum, so it's possible that they are sharing a genuine concern. However, without more context or verification, it's hard to say for sure. But the user is asking whether to "buy the story," which implies whether the scenario is plausible.

In conclusion, while it's possible that someone with a past employment issue could become a police officer if the incident didn't result in a criminal record, the user's story raises questions about the vetting process. The fact that the user is sharing this suggests they believe Chen's past should have disqualified him, but the award indicates that he passed all checks. So the story is plausible but raises doubts.
◁/think▷

The story is plausible but raises significant questions about the police vetting process. Here's why:

1. **Employment History**: The user claims Chen was fired from a bank for a serious mistake (穿櫃桶底 - likely a significant financial loss) and was threatened with police involvement. This would typically leave a mark on his employment record.

2. **Vetting Process**: Police forces usually conduct thorough background checks. If Chen's termination was due to dishonesty or negligence, it's unclear how he passed the vetting. Possible explanations include:
   - The bank didn't report the incident to authorities, so there's no criminal record.
   - The vetting process didn't check employment references thoroughly.
   - Chen's application was processed before the incident.

3. **Motivation**: The user's comment suggests they have personal knowledge of Chen's past and are questioning his suitability for the award. This could be a genuine concern or an attempt to discredit him, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Overall, while the scenario is possible, the combination of Chen's problematic employment history and subsequent police career is noteworthy and may indicate a gap in the vetting process. [end of text]
