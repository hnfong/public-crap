Okay, let's break down this paragraph. I'll provide the critique in English, as it allows for a more nuanced discussion of the arguments.

**Overview of the Situation & Problem**

The author is an older worker (referred to as "阿叔" - uncle), likely someone who started working at a young age (specifically mentioning age 13). He's observing a trend of attractive young people complaining about not being able to find jobs. He's particularly puzzled by the fact that companies are offering cash payments (現金糧) as an incentive to attract applicants, and he's critical of those applicants who *still* can't find work despite this incentive. 

The core problem, as he sees it, isn't a lack of job *offers*, but a mismatch between the expectations and qualifications of job seekers and the realities of the job market. He believes many applicants lack the experience and education to justify being hired, and are unwilling to accept jobs that are physically demanding, low-paying, or lack perceived future prospects – things he himself was perfectly willing to accept when he was young. He feels this unwillingness is a key reason why companies are struggling to find employees.  He essentially argues that the problem lies with the applicants' attitudes and lack of skills, not with the employers' offers.

**Why the Problem Arises (According to the Author)**

The author believes the problem stems from a shift in mindset. He implies that younger generations have become accustomed to higher expectations and are less willing to endure the hardships he faced early in his career. He sees the reliance on cash payments as a desperate attempt by companies to lure applicants who are otherwise deterred by the nature of the work.  He frames it as a lack of self-awareness – applicants complaining about conditions they are ill-equipped to avoid given their limited qualifications.

**Do I Agree with His Conclusion?**

I partially agree with his conclusion, but it's a very simplified and somewhat harsh assessment. He identifies a *real* issue – a gap between expectations and reality in the job market.  There *is* a segment of the population that may have unrealistic expectations, particularly if they haven't had much work experience.  The rise of "gig economy" and social media can also contribute to a perception that all work should be glamorous or highly compensated.

However, his analysis is overly dismissive of broader systemic issues. Here's where I disagree:

* **Economic Factors:** The job market has changed dramatically.  The cost of living has increased significantly, making low-paying jobs less viable.  The availability of education has also increased, meaning more people *have* qualifications, and therefore may be less willing to accept jobs that don't utilize them.
* **Job Quality:** Many entry-level jobs *are* genuinely unpleasant, with poor working conditions and limited opportunities for advancement.  It's not simply a matter of attitude; some jobs are legitimately undesirable.
* **Discrimination:** Ageism and other forms of discrimination can play a role in hiring decisions.  While the author focuses on the perceived shortcomings of young applicants, older workers also face challenges.
* **The Cash Payment Issue:** Offering cash payments *is* a sign of a problem. It suggests that employers are struggling to attract workers even at the advertised wage, indicating that the wage itself may be too low, or the working conditions are particularly bad. It's not just about applicant "attitude."

**In conclusion:** The author has a point about personal responsibility and the need to be realistic about job prospects. However, his analysis is overly simplistic and ignores the complex economic and social factors that contribute to the current employment challenges. It's a perspective rooted in his own experiences, which are valid, but don't necessarily represent the full picture.

**(Cantonese Version - a shorter summary of the critique)**

呢段嘢嘅作者係一個老一輩嘅打工仔，佢覺得而家啲後生仔女成日投訴搵唔到工，但公司又用現金糧嚟吸引人，都仲係度呻，佢覺得問題唔係公司唔夠好offer，而係啲人自己條件唔夠好，唔願意做辛苦嘅工。

我同意佢講嘅有啲道理，後生仔女嘅期望值可能高咗，但佢嘅分析太過片面。經濟環境變咗，生活成本高咗，好多低薪嘅工根本唔夠用。而且，好多入門級嘅工真係好辛苦，冇前景。除咗個人態度，仲有好多其他因素影響咗搵工嘅難度，例如經濟問題、工作質素、歧視等等。用現金糧都係一個警號，表示公司嘅待遇可能唔夠吸引人。所以，作者嘅睇法有啲啱，但唔係全部。
