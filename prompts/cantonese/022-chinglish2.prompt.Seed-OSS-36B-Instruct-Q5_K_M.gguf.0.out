<seed:think>
Got it, let's tackle this translation. First, I need to remember that the original text has a lot of colloquial Singaporean/Malaysian English, so I need to simplify it to standard English while keeping the conversational tone.

Starting with Alice: "hah. yeh. me 2." That's easy—"Haha. Yeah. Me too." 

Next: "I like to play very much gah." "Gah" here is probably a typo or slang, maybe "games"? So "I really like playing games a lot." 

"but never gamble lor" — "lor" is a filler, so "but I never gamble, though." 

":)" stays as is.

Bob: "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" — "Orr..." is like "Oh..." so "Oh... I never gamble when playing Big2 either ;-)" (Big2 is a card game, so keep that as is). 

"except for that time a few weeks ago" — straightforward: "except for that time a few weeks ago."

Alice: "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?" "Joe mud" might be "what happened" or "what was it"? Wait, maybe "joe" is a typo for "jio" (Singaporean/Malaysian for "invite")? "Joe mud ah" could be "what was it about?" or "what happened then?" Maybe "A few weeks ago, what was it?" or more naturally, "A few weeks ago, what happened?"

Bob: "went to a friends house" — "went to a friend's house" (possessive). 

"he wanted to play big2 wor" — "wor" is a filler, so "he wanted to play Big2, you know." 

"gum i say play lor" — "gum" is probably "so" or "then", "lor" filler: "so I said okay, let's play." 

"gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)" — "so he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays really well)." 

"gum I fai si 'so hing' la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..." — "fai si" might be "feel" or "think"? "so hing" is "excited" or "into it"? "jeh" is filler. So: "and I thought, 'why not, might as well be excited'... besides, I'd at most lose like $10 anyway..."

Alice: "gum yau hai" — "gum" is "so", "yau hai" maybe "that's true" or "yeah": "So that's true." 

":) hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" — This one is trickier. "Lei gor" might be "you guys" or "you", "yuun doe gei" maybe "play games" (slang), "moe sor wai" could be "no problem" or "it's okay". Maybe: "hehe. You guys playing games is no big deal, right?" 

"it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor" — "ngor" is "I", "juun hai yiu" maybe "really want to", so: "Actually, it's okay. But if I really wanted to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, though."

Bob: "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga..." — "stand so hard" might be "be so serious" or "take it so seriously": "but it's not so good to take it so seriously, you know..." 

"yea if need to gamble it's very stressful..." — straightforward: "Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful..." 

"btw, do u have the program?" — "By the way, do you have the program?"

Alice: "meh program." — "Meh" is "no" or "what program?", so "No program." or "What program?" Maybe "No, I don't have the program." 

"moe" — maybe "nothing" or "what?" Maybe "Nothing." 

"hai ng hai yiu download or sth" — "hai ng" might be "do you want" (slang), "sth" is "something": "Do you want me to download it or something?" 

":)" stays.

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la..." — "so playing online, of course you need a program to play, right..." 

"my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..." — straightforward: "My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... wait..."

Alice: "hoe ark." — Maybe "how about" or "what about"? "How about?" 

":) ng goi sai hehe" — "ng goi sai" might be "I don't know" or "never mind": "hehe, never mind" or "hehe, I don't know."

Now, checking for flow and making sure it's simple English. Let me piece it together smoothly:

Alice:  
Haha. Yeah. Me too.  
I really like playing games a lot.  
But I never gamble, though.  
:)  

Bob:  
Oh... I never gamble when playing Big2 either ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

Alice:  
A few weeks ago, what happened?  

Bob:  
Went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2, you know.  
So I said okay, let's play.  
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays really well).  
And I thought, "Why not, might as well have fun"... besides, I'd at most lose like $10 anyway...  

Alice:  
So that's true.  
:)  
Hehe. You guys playing games is no big deal, right?  
Actually, it's okay. But if I really wanted to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, though.  

Bob:  
But it's not so good to take it too seriously, you know...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program?  

Alice:  
No, I don't have the program.  
Nothing.  
Do you want me to download it or something?  
:)  

Bob:  
So playing online, of course you need a program to play, right...  
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... wait...  

Alice:  
How about?  
:)  
Hehe, never mind.

Wait, "joe mud ah" — maybe "what was it" is better than "what happened". Let me adjust Alice's line: "A few weeks ago, what was it?" Maybe more natural. 

"fai si 'so hing' la" — "so hing" is a Cantonese term meaning "excited" or "into it", so "I felt like having fun" might be better than "why not, might as well be excited". So: "And I thought, 'might as well have fun'... besides, I'd at most lose like $10 anyway..."

"lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" — maybe "You playing games isn't a problem, right?" since "lei gor" could be "you" (singular) instead of "you guys". So: "Hehe. You playing games isn't a problem, right?"

"ngor juun hai yiu gamble" — "if I really want to gamble" (remove "would" maybe: "But if I really wanted to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, though." Wait, original is "if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy..." so "if I really want to gamble, I won't enjoy..." but past tense? Maybe "if I really wanted to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy..." is okay.

"stand so hard" — "take it so seriously" is good.

"hai ng hai yiu download or sth" — "Do you want me to download it or something?" That makes sense.

"hoe ark" — maybe "How come?" or "What's up?" but "How about?" is possible. Alternatively, maybe "Oh right." but not sure. Maybe "How about that?" but contextually, Alice might be responding to Bob's FTP/HTTP suggestion, so "How about?" is okay.

"ng goi sai" — "ngo gai sai" in Cantonese is "I don't know" (literally "I don't understand"), so "Hehe, I don't know." might be better than "never mind".

Putting it all together with these adjustments:

Alice:  
Haha. Yeah. Me too.  
I really like playing games a lot.  
But I never gamble, though.  
:)  

Bob:  
Oh... I never gamble when playing Big2 either ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

Alice:  
A few weeks ago, what was it?  

Bob:  
Went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2, you know.  
So I said okay, let's play.  
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays really well).  
And I thought, "Might as well have fun"... besides, I'd at most lose like $10 anyway...  

Alice:  
So that's true.  
:)  
Hehe. You playing games isn't a problem, right?  
Actually, it's okay. But if I really wanted to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, though.  

Bob:  
But it's not so good to take it too seriously, you know...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program?  

Alice:  
No, I don't have the program.  
Nothing.  
Do you want me to download it or something?
