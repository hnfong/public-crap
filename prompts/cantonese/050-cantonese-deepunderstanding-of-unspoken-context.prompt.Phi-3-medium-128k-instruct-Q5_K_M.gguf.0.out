 The person in the paragraph is a job seeker who is struggling to find employment. They are facing several problems, including a lack of experience, education, and market demand for their skills. They are also questioning the requirement of companies to offer cash incentives to attract job seekers, wondering if they are not qualified enough to receive such benefits.

The person has come to the conclusion that the reason they are not getting hired is not because of the companies' inadequate offers, but rather because of their own shortcomings. They have realized that they need to improve their skills and qualifications to be more competitive in the job market.

I agree with the person's conclusion. It is essential for job seekers to assess their own skills and qualifications and work on improving them to increase their chances of getting hired. While companies' offers and incentives can be attractive, they are not the only factors that determine whether a job seeker gets hired or not. Ultimately, it is the job seeker's responsibility to present themselves as the best candidate for the job.
