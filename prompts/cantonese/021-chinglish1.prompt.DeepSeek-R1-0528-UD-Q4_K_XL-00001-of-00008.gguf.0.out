Okay, the user wants me to translate ten Chinglish phrases into proper Cantonese. Let me start by understanding what Chinglish is. From the description, it's a mix of Cantonese and English, written phonetically with English characters, common in Hong Kong during the 90s due to limited Chinese input software. 

First, I need to parse each phrase by recognizing the Cantonese words based on their sounds. For example, "nei ho" becomes "你好" (hello). The user provided examples, so I should follow that pattern. 

Looking at the first phrase: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah". Breaking it down: "gor" might be "嗰" (that), "doe" could be "度" (place), "yau" is "有" (have), "bin" is "邊" (which), "tai" is "睇" (watch), "lo" and "ah" are sentence particles. So it translates to "嗰度有嗰邊睇囉啊？" meaning "Can you see that place over there?"

Next, "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?" Here, "ngor" is "我" (I), "ng sik" is "唔識" (don't know), "use" is English, so it's code-mixed. "Fai zi" is "fax", "gah" is a particle. "Chi gang" might be "磁缸" (disk drive), "duck" is "得" (can). So: "我唔識use fax㗎，use磁缸得唔得？" Asking if using a disk drive instead of fax is okay.

Third phrase: "mud yeah lei ga?" "Mud" is "乜" (what), "yeah" is "嘢" (thing), "lei" is "嚟" (come), "ga" is particle. So "乜嘢嚟㗎？" meaning "What is this?"

Fourth: "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah". "But yuu" might be "不如" (how about), "yat chai" is "一齊" (together), "yum cha" is "飲茶" (drink tea). So "不如一齊飲茶啦" suggesting to have dim sum together.

Fifth: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu". "Gor" is "嗰" (that), "send jor" is "send咗" (sent), "hui" is "去" (to), "nei gor" is "你嗰" (your), "lu" is particle. So "嗰password send咗去你嗰Yahoo email嚕" meaning the password was sent to the Yahoo email.

Sixth: "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga". "Farn hok" is "返學" (go to school), "ho sun fu" is "好辛苦" (very hard), "gei si" is "其實" (actually), "sin fong" is "先放" (only then release). So "返學好辛苦囉，其實先放假㗎" implying school is hard, and actually, it's time for a break.

Seventh: "yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok". "Yau chin" is "有錢" (have money), "daap sik si" is "讀書係" (studying is), "farn hok" is "返學" (school). So "有錢啦，讀書係返學..." meaning with money, studying is going to school... maybe sarcastic about paying for education.

Eighth: "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung". "Kui doe" is "佢哋" (they), "9" and "8" are numbers, "connect" is English, "man kui" is "問佢" (ask him), "yat yeung" is "一樣" (same), "jau darp" is "又答" (again answer), "dai yeung" is "啲樣" (the way). So "佢哋9唔connect8㗎，問佢一樣嘢又答啲樣" meaning they don't connect 9 and 8, and when asked the same thing, they answer differently.

Ninth: "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju". "Need" is English, "boot gei" might be "部機" (the machine), "wait me" is "等我" (wait for me), "ng hoe" is "唔好" (don't), "hoi chi" is "開機" (turn on), "ju" is particle. So "Need boot機，等我，唔好開住" meaning need to boot the machine, wait, don't turn it on yet.

Tenth: "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai". "Yap sat" is "入息" (income), "yim sat" is "驗測" (inspect), "gum gan" is "今間" (this period), "gap zai" is "急仔" (urgent). So "入息驗測今間急仔" which might mean income inspection is urgent now. 

I should check each translation for accuracy, ensuring the Cantonese matches the phonetic hints and context. Also, note where English is mixed in, like "use" or "connect", keeping them as is. The user might be nostalgic about 90s Hong Kong internet culture or need this for communication. Ensuring clarity and correct particles (啦, 囉, 㗎) is crucial for natural Cantonese.

Here's the translation of each Chinglish phrase into standard Cantonese characters, following the pattern of your examples:

1.  **gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah**  
    => 嗰度有嗰邊睇囉啊？  
    *(Can you see that place over there? / Is that spot visible there?)*

2.  **ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?**  
    => 我唔識use fax㗎，use磁缸得唔得？  
    *(I don't know how to use fax, is using a disk drive okay? - Note: "磁缸" (chi gang) is old Hong Kong slang for a computer disk drive)*

3.  **mud yeah lei ga?**  
    => 乜嘢嚟㗎？  
    *(What is this?)*

4.  **but yuu yat chai yum cha lah**  
    => 不如一齊飲茶啦。  
    *(How about we go for yum cha/dim sum together?)*

5.  **gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu**  
    => 嗰password send咗去你嗰Yahoo email嚕。  
    *(That password has been sent to your Yahoo email.)*

6.  **farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga**  
    => 返學好辛苦囉，其實先放假㗎。  
    *(Going to school is so tough, actually it should be holiday time now.)*

7.  **yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok...**  
    => 有錢啦，讀書係返學...  
    *(Got money now, studying means going to school... - Implies paying for education)*

8.  **kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung**  
    => 佢哋9唔connect8㗎，問佢一樣嘢又答啲樣。  
    *(They don't connect 9 and 8, ask them the same thing and they answer differently - Meaning inconsistent or illogical)*

9.  **need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju**  
    => Need boot機，等我，唔好開住。  
    *(Need to boot the machine, wait for me, don't turn it on yet.)*

10. **yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai**  
    => 入息驗測今期急仔。  
    *(Income verification/testing is urgent this period - Likely referring to tax or financial checks)*

**Key Translation Notes:**

*   **Phonetic Matching:** The Cantonese characters are chosen based on the sound of the Chinglish words (e.g., "ngor" = 我, "mud" = 乜, "farn" = 返).
*   **Code-Mixing:** English words present in the Chinglish ("use", "password", "send", "Yahoo email", "connect", "boot", "Need") are kept as-is in the Cantonese text, reflecting common Hong Kong usage.
*   **Sentence Particles:** Cantonese particles (啦, 囉, 啊, 㗎, 嚕, 住) are added where indicated by the Chinglish ("ah", "gah", "lor", "lah", "lu", "ju") to convey tone, mood, or aspect.
*   **Context:** Translations consider common Hong Kong expressions and slang (e.g., 磁缸 for disk drive, 急仔 for urgent).
*   **Structure:** The grammatical structure of the original Chinglish is preserved as closely as possible in the Cantonese output. [end of text]
