The person in question is likely a young adult who has been struggling to find employment, particularly in a field that requires specific qualifications or experience. They mention that they are not a "pretty boy or girl" and that they have been rejected by companies that offer only cash payments. The paragraph suggests that the person feels undervalued and unappreciated, as they believe that their lack of qualifications and experience makes them unattractive to potential employers.

The main problem the person is facing is the lack of job opportunities due to their limited qualifications and experience. They also seem to be frustrated with the current job market, which they perceive as favoring those with more experience and better qualifications. The person concludes that the issue is not just with the job offers but with the people themselves, implying that many potential employers are not willing to consider candidates who do not meet their specific requirements.

I agree with the person's conclusion to some extent. While it is true that the job market often favors candidates with more experience and qualifications, it is also important to consider that many employers are willing to train and develop employees who demonstrate potential and a willingness to learn. The person's frustration is understandable, but it may be beneficial for them to explore alternative approaches, such as networking, gaining relevant skills through online courses or volunteering, or considering entry-level positions that can provide a stepping stone to more senior roles.

However, the person's conclusion that the issue is fundamentally with the people themselves may be too broad. It is possible that the job market is changing rapidly, and employers are adapting to new trends and requirements. Additionally, the person's own attitude and approach to job hunting may also be contributing to their difficulties. It is essential for them to re-evaluate their strategy and consider ways to improve their chances of success in the job market. [end of text]
