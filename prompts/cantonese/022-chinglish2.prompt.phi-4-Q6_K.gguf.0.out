Here's a simple English translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob:

## Alice:
Haha. Yeah, me too. I really like to play games. But I never gamble, though. :)

## Bob:
Or... I never gamble on Big2 either. Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, was it Joe Mud?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2. I said, "Sure, let's play." He said it would be one cent per card because he's really good. I thought, "So what?" Besides, I'd only lose about $10 at most.

## Alice:
I see. Hehe. It's good actually. But if you have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully.

## Bob:
But it's not very good to be so stubborn. Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful... By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
I have the program. You can download it or something. :)

## Bob:
Of course, you need a program to play online. My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP. Wait...

## Alice:
Okay. :) I'll try that. Hehe. [end of text]
