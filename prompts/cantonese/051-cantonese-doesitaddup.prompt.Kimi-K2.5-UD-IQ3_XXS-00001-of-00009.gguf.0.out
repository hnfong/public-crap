This is an interesting case of online defamation that requires careful analysis. Let me break down my assessment:

## Red Flags in the Comment

**1. Suspicious Specificity Combined with Anonymity**
- The commenter claims intimate knowledge (specific bank, specific timeline, specific threat from boss) yet posts anonymously
- Uses the person's full name while hiding behind a pseudonym themselves
- Real colleagues with legitimate concerns typically report through proper channels, not public forums

**2. Classic Defamation Tropes**
- "衰穿櫃桶底" (betrayal/theft) — vague, serious allegation without specifics
- Claims superior knowledge ("唔知點解會過到vetting") implying corruption in police recruitment
- Dramatic scene-setting (security escorting him out) designed for maximum humiliation

**3. Logical Inconsistencies**
- If the offense was serious enough for immediate termination with police threats, why wasn't he actually prosecuted?
- Police vetting is rigorous; a dismissal for cause from a major bank would typically surface
- The timeline ("輾轉走左去考警察") suggests gap — yet vetting covers employment history

## What Makes This Dubious

| Element | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Timing | Posted after award announcement — classic jealousy/resentment pattern |
| Motive | Destroys credibility of someone receiving recognition |
| Verifiability | Specific enough to seem credible, vague enough to be unprovable |
| Language | "我係...前同事" — common opening in HK forum defamation |

## My Assessment

**I don't buy it.** This has the hallmarks of **targeted character assassination**:

- The award made the officer newsworthy, creating opportunity for attack
- The allegations are serious yet conveniently unverifiable
- No documentation offered, no reporting to authorities at the time
- The narrative serves a clear purpose: "He doesn't deserve recognition"

**Alternative explanations:**
- Genuine but exaggerated grievance from someone passed over for promotion
- Mistaken identity or conflation of different people
- Pure fabrication by someone with unrelated grievance (political, personal, or random malice)

The police vetting process, while imperfect, makes the core claim — that someone dismissed for integrity issues smoothly entered the force — somewhat implausible without further explanation.
