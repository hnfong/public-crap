The story shared by 陳大文銀行前同事 (Chen Daowen, a former colleague at the same bank) about 陳大文銀行前同事 (Chen Daowen) being an outstanding policeman is quite detailed and personal. However, without additional context or corroboration from other sources, it's difficult to definitively determine the veracity of the story. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Personal Experience**: The story is based on the personal experience of 陳大文銀行前同事, who worked closely with Chen Daowen during his first week on the job. Personal anecdotes can be powerful and often contain elements of truth, but they can also be influenced by the teller's perspective and biases.

2. **Specific Details**: The story includes specific details, such as Chen Daowen being assigned to shadow another officer, being disciplined for poor performance, and ultimately being taken to the vetting process for police recruitment. These details suggest a level of specificity that could lend credibility to the story. However, without independent confirmation, it's hard to verify these specifics.

3. **General Observations**: The story mentions broader issues, such as Chen Daowen's "petit bourgeois" (lower-middle-class) background and his "poor" vetting results. These types of observations can be generalized and may not necessarily be unique to Chen Daowen. It's possible that similar issues could arise with other individuals, making the story less unique to Chen Daowen.

4. **Motivation**: The story could be motivated by personal feelings or a desire to share an interesting or dramatic experience. People often share stories that resonate with them or that they believe will be well-received by others. While this doesn't necessarily mean the story is false, it does suggest that personal motivations could play a role in how the story is presented.

5. **Lack of Evidence**: The story lacks concrete evidence, such as official documents, witness statements, or a record of Chen Daowen's vetting process. Without such evidence, it's challenging to independently verify the claims made in the story.

6. **Cultural and Social Context**: The story is set in a specific cultural and social context, where certain behaviors and outcomes (e.g., being disciplined, failing vetting) may carry particular weight. Understanding this context can help in interpreting the story, but it doesn't provide definitive proof of its accuracy.

In conclusion, while the story shared by 陳大文銀行前同事 may contain elements of truth, it's difficult to confirm its accuracy without additional evidence. Personal anecdotes can be compelling, but they should be taken with a degree of skepticism, especially without corroboration from other sources. If the story is important or relevant, seeking independent verification or additional details would be a prudent step. [end of text]
