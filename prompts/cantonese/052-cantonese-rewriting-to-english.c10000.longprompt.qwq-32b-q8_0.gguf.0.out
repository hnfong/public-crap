Okay, I need to tackle this user's request. First, they want the given Chinese essay translated into English. Then, they want a comment on the essay, focusing on the main point while ignoring the sarcastic tone.

Starting with the translation. The user specified not to translate individual words or phrases, so I should keep the original terms in Chinese where they are hashtags or specific terms. The essay uses a lot of colloquial Cantonese, so I need to make sure the translation captures the informal tone but remains understandable in English. For example, phrases like "放工返屋企上網" would be "clocked off work and went home to surf the internet." Also, some hashtags like #余英时 should stay as is, maybe with a note, but the user says not to translate individual words, so just leave them.

Next, the essay's content. The author is discussing the academic reputation of Yü Ying-shih, comparing him to their respected teacher, Yun Gen. They critique how Confucianism is adapted in Western academia, particularly in the US, to fit Western values like democracy, rather than its traditional context. The sarcastic tone mocks the adaptation and the possible compromises made to gain academic status.

For the comment, the main point is that the author is questioning the authenticity of how Confucianism is presented in Western academic circles. They argue that scholars like Yü Ying-shih might be distorting or adapting Confucian ideas to fit Western, particularly American, contexts to gain acceptance and academic positions. The critique extends to how such adaptations serve Western power structures rather than the original philosophy's intent. The author uses historical examples (like Confucius's struggles, the evolution of Confucianism into legalism, and modern political systems in Taiwan and Japan) to support the idea that Confucianism is being rebranded to fit democratic ideals, which might not be true to its roots.

I need to ensure the comment doesn't focus on the sarcasm but the underlying argument. Also, check if the translation accurately reflects the original's nuances, especially the informal language and the specific cultural references.

### English Translation of the Essay:  
Three hours ago, I clocked off work and went home to surf the internet. I saw people mourning #Yü Ying-shih. At first, I only knew he was the idol of the famous blogger #Wong Wai-wing professor, but I knew nothing about his life.  

However, in the 21st century, you don’t need to “kneel and ask” teachers—Google can tell you everything. After a round of searches, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wong always spoke so fondly of Old Yu…  

Old Yu had been a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive! Just the name alone is intimidating!  

I was like a stalker, digging into Yu Ying-shih’s background: How does the Chinese Wikipedia describe him? How does the English Wikipedia describe him? How did people praise him when he won awards? How do today’s obituaries talk about him? In my mind, I saw the person I most respected—Root Teacher. They’re so similar!  

Unfortunately, Root Teacher never had a Harvard professorship, but the tradition of “broadly versed in ancient and modern times” and “I am Chinese” in their teachings definitely came from the same lineage. Root Teacher loved Daoism and Buddhism, while Old Yu seemed to be a Confucian fan.  

But that’s a problem.  

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trustworthiness, and hierarchical order. But if you studied at a top U.S. university and earned your PhD during the peak of the hippie era, wouldn’t you be embarrassed to go around preaching “respect for teachers and elders” and opposing “individualism”? That’s too cringey.  

Speaking of scholars avoiding cringe, it’s the bitter lesson Confucius spent his life learning. Confucian disciples couldn’t be unaware: In Confucius’s time, the world was on the brink of chaos. He wandered the states seeking a position of power to accomplish great things. But he only knew how to recite books about Duke of Zhou’s rituals and failed to cater to his bosses’ needs, ending in failure. However, failure is the mother of success—his students were more pragmatic. As Sima Qian noted, “Of the seventy disciples, the great became tutors and ministers, the lesser became advisors to scholars.” Why?  

Because after generations of adaptation, they learned to read their bosses’ moods. By Mencius’s time, his interactions with rulers were already more flexible—he flattered them: “Your Majesty, I see you’re unwilling to kill even a cow—what a benevolent ruler you are! Follow the ‘Way of the King,’ and you’ll succeed!”  

By the Warring States period, “Confucian” strategists had mastered the “ruler interview” game. To gain office, they discarded “benevolence” and “propriety” and focused on the new “legalism” tech. Hence, Xunzi, a Confucian disciple, trained students like Li Si, who became high officials in the Qin dynasty. In Li Si, you’d smell zero traces of Confucius.  

Today, with over 200 UN member states, the world is more complex than the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian heirs leaving China—the ancient “land of rites”—to the “barbaric” U.S. military superpower—would they really pull out the *Analects* and demand people “observe three years of mourning”? Confucius’s failed job-hunting saga is well-known. So, in America, Confucian disciples must claim the Master supports “democracy,” “democracy is great,” and the CCP is “pathetic and deserves to be overthrown”—only then can they get Ivy League professorships!  

Someone might ask: “What’s the consequence of this?” There is none! Confucius and Mencius died over 2,000 years ago, and the Confucian tradition was smashed during the #May Fourth Movement. As the academic authorities of the sole superpower post-WWII, you could even claim “Confucius taught people to take drugs and sleep around,” and some might believe it—after all, the “theoretical nukes” of Western academia are solid. The Japanese paid the price for their skepticism, as everyone remembers vividly from history.  

So why could Old Yu casually translate a few lines from the *Han Shu* into English to get his PhD and land Ivy League professorships? #YouGetIt. They’re pushing you onto the altar of authority so you’ll say, “You’re all ‘rubber ducks’ [followers]. You think Confucianism is feudal? Oh no, a huge misunderstanding! It’s *truly* a democratic fighter! Without a Harvard seat, just shut up and read the books!”  

As for whether Confucianism conflicts with democracy? Well, do “Sinologists” know the answer? Take the Republic of China as an example. Hey, what’s “Confucian” about Taiwan’s political system? The KMT’s daily bashing of Tsai Ing-wen—does that count as Confucianism? Did Tsai really perform rituals to heaven? No. Scientific spirit, not being a shaman—doesn’t that violate Confucian principles? Do you think using Chinese characters makes something Confucian? Do you think Confucianism can only exist in China?  

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, Britain is Confucian (at least the most advanced nations resemble this): Rulers emphasize ceremonial hierarchy, power is “divine,” supreme and unchallengeable, with strict social stratification—only then can society be stable. As for the success or failure of their democratic systems, a Chinese-American has no right to criticize.

### Commentary on the Essay:  
Disregarding the sarcastic and irreverent tone, the author’s main point is a critique of how Confucianism is reinterpreted and repackaged in Western academic and political contexts to serve Western ideological agendas. The essay argues that figures like Yü Ying-shih (a prominent Sinologist) and others in Western academia distort Confucianism’s original philosophical and historical roots to align it with Western values like democracy, individualism, and anti-communism. This adaptation, the author suggests, is not about genuine scholarship but about leveraging Confucianism as a tool to legitimize Western power structures and cultural dominance.  

Key themes include:  
1. **Cultural Adaptation for Acceptance**: Confucianism is stripped of its traditional hierarchical and ritualistic elements to fit Western frameworks, such as democracy, to gain academic and social credibility.  
2. **Historical Irony**: The author points out that Confucianism itself evolved through pragmatic compromises (e.g., Mencius flattering rulers, Xunzi’s shift to legalism), suggesting that its current Western reinterpretation is just another phase of this adaptability.  
3. **Power Dynamics**: The essay implies that Western institutions (e.g., Ivy League universities) have the authority to redefine non-Western philosophies to serve their interests, often ignoring or distorting their original contexts.  
4. **Critique of “Sinology”**: The author questions the legitimacy of Western scholars’ interpretations of Confucianism, arguing that their work is shaped by biases and geopolitical agendas rather than scholarly rigor.  

In essence, the essay challenges the idea that Confucianism can be universally “democratized” or simplified into Western terms, highlighting the tension between cultural authenticity and the instrumentalization of tradition for power. [end of text]
