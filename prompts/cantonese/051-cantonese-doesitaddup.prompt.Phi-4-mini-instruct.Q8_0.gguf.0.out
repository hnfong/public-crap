The story you shared about your former colleague, Mr. Chen Da Wen, being an outstanding policeman seems to be a personal anecdote rather than a verified fact. While it is possible that Mr. Chen Da Wen could have had a positive impact on your life and may have indeed become a successful police officer, there are several reasons to approach this story with caution:

1. **Personal Anecdote**: The story is based on your personal experience and observations. Personal anecdotes can be compelling and emotionally charged, but they do not constitute objective evidence.

2. **Lack of Verification**: There is no external verification or official record provided to confirm Mr. Chen Da Wen's achievements or career progression. Without corroborating evidence, it is difficult to substantiate the claims made in the story.

3. **Potential Bias**: As a former colleague, you may have a positive bias towards Mr. Chen Da Wen. It is important to consider that personal relationships can sometimes influence our perceptions and recollections of events.

4. **Incomplete Information**: The story focuses on a specific incident involving Mr. Chen Da Wen's behavior at work. While this incident may have contributed to his career choice, it does not provide a comprehensive view of his character or professional accomplishments.

5. **Generalization**: The story implies that Mr. Chen Da Wen had personal issues that led him to become a police officer. It is important to avoid making generalizations about someone's character based on a single incident or limited information.

In summary, while Mr. Chen Da Wen's story may be inspiring and true for you personally, it is not sufficient to definitively prove his outstanding career as a policeman without additional evidence and verification. It is always good to seek out multiple sources of information and corroborating evidence before drawing conclusions about someone's professional achievements. [end of text]
