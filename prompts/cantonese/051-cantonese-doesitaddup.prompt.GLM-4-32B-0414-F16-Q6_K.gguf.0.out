This story is highly suspicious and difficult to "buy" at face value for several reasons:

1.  **The Severity of the Alleged Dismissal:** Being fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (literally "bad to the point of piercing through the bottom of the drawer/cupboard," implying extreme dishonesty/theft) is a very serious offense, especially in a high-trust environment like a bank. The manager's threat to call the police if the employee didn't leave immediately is also a strong reaction, suggesting the situation was perceived as very serious and potentially criminal.

2.  **The Vetting Process:** Becoming a police officer in Hong Kong (or most places) involves a rigorous vetting process. This process typically includes thorough background checks, character assessments, and checks for any criminal history or serious misconduct. An incident involving alleged theft serious enough to warrant police involvement *and* immediate dismissal from a previous job would almost certainly disqualify someone from passing the vetting required to join the police force. The claim that the person "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (doesn't know why they passed the vetting) is highly unlikely. If they *did* pass, it would mean either:
    *   The story is fabricated.
    *   The vetting process was incredibly flawed or negligent (less likely).
    *   The severity of the incident was exaggerated in the story.

3.  **Motivation of the Commenter:** The commenter presents themselves as a former colleague. Their tone is negative and seems aimed at discrediting the police officer who received the award. This suggests a potential bias or grudge. While past negative experiences can happen, the specific details and the ultimate outcome (joining the police) make the story seem designed to be damaging.

4.  **Specificity vs. Plausibility:** While the details (shadowing, specific reason for firing, manager's threat, police involvement) are specific, their combination stretches credulity, especially the final step of joining the police force.

**Conclusion:**

Given the extreme unlikelihood that someone dismissed for alleged theft serious enough to involve police *would* pass the stringent vetting required to become a police officer, the story sounds like a fabrication or a significant exaggeration. It appears designed to tarnish the reputation of the award-winning officer by associating him with past dishonesty. Therefore, I do not buy the story as presented. [end of text]
