<think>Hmm, this is a forum comment about a policeman named Chen Dawen who recently received an award. The commenter claims to be his former colleague at a British bank, saying he was fired for "stealing from the drawer" within his first week of shadowing, and that management threatened to report him to the police if he didn't leave immediately. The commenter expresses disbelief that he passed police vetting given his "character issues."

The user asks whether I buy this story and to explain my reasoning. This requires careful analysis of the comment's credibility while maintaining neutrality. The comment lacks specific details like the bank's name or exact dates, which makes verification difficult. The phrasing "衰穿櫃桶底" is colloquial Cantonese meaning "caught stealing from the drawer" - a serious allegation but presented as hearsay.

The story's plausibility needs evaluation from multiple angles. Police vetting processes are typically rigorous, especially in Hong Kong where background checks are thorough. The timeline seems odd: fired on his first week of shadowing, then immediately考警察 (taking police exams) - that transition would require planning and preparation beforehand. The colleague's strong negative tone ("個人品有啲問題") suggests personal bias, though the detailed account of the押住執野走 (escorted to pack belongings) scene adds some credibility.

The user might be seeking either factual assessment or understanding of forum dynamics. Since this is unverified forum content, I should focus on logical evaluation rather than taking sides. The response should acknowledge the comment's detailed narrative while noting verification challenges, police vetting standards, and potential personal bias.</think>I don't buy this story as presented, and here's why:

1. **Lack of verifiable details**: The comment provides no specific names (except "陳大文" which is a common placeholder name), dates, or locations that could be fact-checked. This makes it impossible to verify.

2. **Police vetting standards**: Hong Kong police recruitment has rigorous background checks. If someone was fired for theft ("衰穿櫃桶底") within their first week, this would likely appear in employment records and criminal background checks. Passing vetting with such a serious offense seems improbable.

3. **Timeline inconsistency**: The story claims he was fired on his first week of shadowing, then immediately考警察 (took police exams). Police recruitment processes take months/years - it's unlikely someone would transition so quickly after being fired for theft.

4. **Personal bias**: The tone is clearly negative ("個人品有啲問題", "唔知點解會過到vetting個關"). This suggests personal animosity rather than objective reporting.

5. **Common forum trope**: Unverified "insider" stories about award recipients being undeserving are frequent on forums, often without evidence.

**Conclusion**: While it's *possible* this happened, the story lacks credibility due to:
- No verifiable specifics
- Unlikely vetting timeline
- Serious allegations without proof
- Clear personal bias
- Common forum pattern of unverified claims

Without concrete evidence or official confirmation, this appears more likely to be a personal grievance or forum speculation than factual reporting. Police vetting systems exist precisely to catch such character issues. [end of text]
