This story is highly questionable and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Here's why:

1.  **Anonymity:** The commenter is anonymous ("我係..."). While anonymity is common on forums, it makes it impossible to verify their identity or their claim of being a former colleague.
2.  **Specific but Potentially Fabricated Details:**
    *   Naming the person ("陳大文") makes the claim seem specific, but it could be easily fabricated.
    *   Mentioning a "某間英資大行" (certain British-major bank) is vague enough to sound plausible but specific enough to be made up.
    *   The timeline (one year, first week) and the event (stealing banknotes from the drawer) are quite specific, which could lend credence, but also makes it easier to spot inconsistencies or fabrications if challenged.
3.  **The Core Allegation (Theft):** Accusations of theft, especially involving money ("衰穿櫃桶底" - stealing banknotes from the drawer), are serious. Such an incident would likely leave a paper trail (disciplinary records, police report if the boss threatened to call them, HR records).
4.  **The Vetting Process:** The commenter explicitly states, "佢個人品有啲問題...唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (His character has some issues... I don't know how he passed the vetting process). Police vetting processes are designed to be thorough precisely to weed out individuals with questionable backgrounds, including criminal history or dishonesty. For someone allegedly fired for theft and potentially involved with police *before* being fired (if the boss threatened to call them), passing vetting seems highly improbable. This contradiction weakens the story significantly.
5.  **Motivation:** Why would a former colleague make such damaging, unverified accusations against someone who has just received an award? Possible motivations could include:
    *   **Jealousy or Grudge:** Holding a personal grudge from the past.
    *   **Trolling or Attention:** Trying to stir up controversy or get a reaction on the forum.
    *   **Malice:** Deliberately trying to ruin the person's reputation.
    *   **Fabrication:** The story might simply be made up for effect.
6.  **Lack of Evidence:** There is absolutely no evidence provided to support the claim. No proof of employment, no proof of the incident, no proof of the firing.

**Conclusion:**

While the story paints a vivid picture, the lack of verifiable evidence, the seriousness of the alleged crime, and the highly improbable outcome of the person passing a police vetting process after such an incident make the story very difficult to believe. It reads more like a malicious attack or a fabricated tale than a factual account. Without independent confirmation or evidence, it should be treated as hearsay. [end of text]
