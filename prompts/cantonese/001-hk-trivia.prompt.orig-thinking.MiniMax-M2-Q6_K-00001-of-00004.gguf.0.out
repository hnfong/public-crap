I need to answer some Hong Kong internet trivia from 2010 to 2018. The first question is about the author of the article "澳牛的黃昏." I think it might be related to a satirical piece about Macau's decline, possibly written by someone like "阿木" or "阿水." I recall that "澳牛的黃昏" is a parody of "香港牛的黃昏," which was written by "阿木." I need to confirm the author of "澳牛的黃昏."
