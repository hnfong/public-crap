The story presented seems to be a comment from a former colleague of a recently awarded outstanding policeman, named Chen Da Wen. The comment suggests that Chen Da Wen's path to becoming a police officer was unconventional and possibly influenced by personal circumstances.

The commenter mentions that Chen Da Wen was shadowed by the commenter for the first week after joining the bank. The commenter implies that Chen Da Wen was struggling with his job, possibly due to poor attire, as he was seen wearing a shirt that was too short. The bank manager threatened to report Chen Da Wen to the authorities if he didn't leave the job immediately. However, the commenter returned to the office later that day and found Chen Da Wen being escorted by security to the police station. The commenter suggests that Chen Da Wen had personal issues and didn't know why he was rejected from the vetting process.

While the story provides insight into Chen Da Wen's background and the circumstances that led him to become a police officer, it's essential to consider the credibility of the comment. The commenter is a former colleague, which adds some personal insight, but the story is subjective and relies heavily on the commenter's interpretation of events.

There are several reasons why one might not buy the story:

1. **Subjectivity**: The commenter's account is based on their personal experience and interpretation of events. It's possible that the commenter is biased or has a preconceived notion about Chen Da Wen's character.

2. **Lack of Objective Evidence**: The story relies on the commenter's memory and observations, which may not be entirely accurate. There is no concrete evidence to support the claims made in the comment.

3. **Unreliable Sources**: The commenter is a former colleague, but their account may not be reliable. Colleagues can have varying perspectives and biases, which can affect their perception of events.

4. **Potential for Misinformation**: The commenter may have misunderstood or misinterpreted the events that led Chen Da Wen to become a police officer. This could result in a distorted or inaccurate account of the situation.

5. **Lack of Context**: The story lacks context about Chen Da Wen's background, motivations, and the vetting process. Without more information, it's difficult to assess the validity of the claims made in the comment.

In conclusion, while the story provides some insight into Chen Da Wen's background and the circumstances that led him to become a police officer, it's essential to approach the comment with a critical eye. The story relies heavily on subjective interpretation and lacks concrete evidence to support the claims made. Therefore, it's not entirely reliable, and one should be cautious when accepting the story at face value. [end of text]
