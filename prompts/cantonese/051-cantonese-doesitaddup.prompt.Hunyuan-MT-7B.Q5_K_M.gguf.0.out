This is a comment on a forum discussing a person who recently received an award for being an outstanding policeman. I am a former colleague of this individual, Chen Dawen, who worked as a trainee police officer at a major British bank for a year. Why do I remember him so well? It's because during his first week of employment, he shadowed me. He was fired for accidentally damaging a drawer, and the manager even threatened to call the police if he didn't leave immediately. The next afternoon, after I returned from lunch, the management and security personnel came down to escort him out of the building. Afterwards, he decided to pursue a career in policing. There are some issues with his character; I wonder how he managed to pass the vetting process.
