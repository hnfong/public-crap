Here’s the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like playing Big2.
But I never gamble, okay?
:)

**Bob:**
Oh… I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? What happened?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend’s house.
He wanted to play Big2.
I said, "Let’s play."
He said, "Okay, but let’s bet 1 cent per card…" (because he’s really good at it).
I thought, "Okay, fine."
Besides, even if I lose, it’s only about $10 max.

**Alice:**
Haha, okay.
:) Hehe. But if you bet money, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.
It’s good, but gambling makes it less fun.

**Bob:**
But it’s not good to be too serious about it…
Yeah, if you have to bet, it’s really stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
My program.
More…
You can download it or something.
:)

**Bob:**
Oh, so you need a program to play Big2 online?
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP… Wait…

**Alice:**
Oh, okay.
:) No problem.
Hehe.
