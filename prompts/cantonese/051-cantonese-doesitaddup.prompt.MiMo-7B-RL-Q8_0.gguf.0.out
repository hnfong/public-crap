Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether I believe the story about the police officer, Chan Da-Wen, who was fired from a British bank and then became a police officer. The key points mentioned are that the person was shadowed by Chan for a week, Chan was fired because he had counterfeit money (穿柜桶底, which I think refers to using counterfeit bills), the manager said he would report him if he didn't leave that day, then he was escorted out, and later became a police officer despite vetting issues.

First, I need to parse the Chinese terms correctly. "穿柜桶底" literally translates to "counterfeit money in the bottom of the drawer," which is a slang term for using counterfeit bills. So Chan was caught with counterfeit money. The user is skeptical because Chan passed the vetting process to become a police officer, which seems unlikely given his past.

Now, the user is asking if I buy the story. So I need to analyze the plausibility. Let's break down the events:

1. Chan was a trainee at a British bank (an "英資大行") and was shadowed by the user for a week. That suggests Chan was a new employee, maybe in a trainee program.

2. Chan was caught with counterfeit money, leading to his dismissal. The manager threatened to report him unless he left that day. Then, he was escorted out by security.

3. Despite this, he became a police officer, which is surprising because police officers undergo rigorous vetting, including criminal checks, character assessments, etc. The user is confused how he passed the vetting.

Possible angles to consider:

- Cultural context: In Hong Kong, "穿柜桶底" is indeed a term for using counterfeit money. So the understanding here is correct.

- Vetting process for police officers: How strict is it? If someone was dismissed for a financial offense, especially involving counterfeit money, that would typically disqualify them from being a cop. However, maybe there are nuances. Perhaps the incident was not discovered during the vetting, or there was a mistake in the vetting process.

- The timeline: How long after being fired did he become a police officer? If there was a period where he wasn't under scrutiny, maybe he could have applied later. But the user mentions he was "輾轉走左去考警察," which implies he went through various steps to become a police officer. If the vetting (vetting here refers to the police's background check) didn't catch this, that's a problem.

- Possible explanations: Maybe the counterfeit money incident wasn't discovered during the vetting. Perhaps the bank didn't report it, or the police didn't check that particular aspect. Or maybe the term used was misunderstood. For example, if "穿柜桶底" was a mistranslation or misunderstanding, maybe it wasn't counterfeit money but something else.

Another point: The user mentions "-person" in the original Chinese, but the name is written as "陳大文". So the full name is Chan Da-Wen. The user refers to him as a former colleague at a British bank, so the story is from the perspective of someone who worked with him.

Potential issues with the story:

- The timeline: If he was fired and then became a police officer, the gap needs to make sense. How quickly can someone transition from being fired to joining the police? It might take some time, but possible.

- The vetting process: In Hong Kong, the police are known to have strict vetting. If someone has a history of financial misconduct, especially involving counterfeit money, it would likely fail the vetting. Unless the incident was not recorded or the police didn't check his previous employment thoroughly.

Possible conclusions:

The story as presented has inconsistencies. The main issue is that passing the vetting process after such a background seems unlikely. The user might be correct in being skeptical. However, there could be factors not mentioned, like the incident being handled internally without a formal record, or the vetting not covering certain aspects. But generally, such a serious offense would surface during vetting. Therefore, the story might have elements of exaggeration or misinterpretation.

The story as presented raises several plausible concerns, and I would not fully buy it based on the information provided. Here's a breakdown of the key issues:

### 1. **Vetting Process Inconsistency**  
   - The claim that Chan Da-Wen passed police vetting after being dismissed for **counterfeit money** (using fake bills) is highly suspicious. In Hong Kong, police recruitment involves rigorous background checks, including criminal records and financial history. A history of financial fraud (even non-criminal cases, like being fired for it) would almost certainly disqualify someone. This alone makes the narrative difficult to believe.

### 2. **Ambiguity of the Incident**  
   - The term **"穿柜桶底" (counterfeit money in the drawer)** is slang, but the exact nature of the incident is unclear. Was Chan caught *using* counterfeit bills (a criminal act) or merely *having* them (which might still raise ethical concerns)? If the bank did not report the incident to authorities, it might not appear on his record, but this would require careful coordination—unlikely in a corporate setting.  
   - The user mentions the manager threatening to "report him," but if the bank followed proper procedures, they might have reported the incident to the police, which would complicate his later police career.

### 3. **Timeline and Transition**  
   - The phrase **"輾轉走左去考警察"** suggests Chan went through multiple steps to join the force. If he was fired and escorted out within the same day, how did he later pass exams and vetting? A gap of several years would be necessary to erase his record, but the story does not clarify this. The abrupt transition strains credibility.

### 4. **Cultural and Institutional Context**  
   - In Hong Kong, banks typically report financial misconduct to the police. If Chan was fired for counterfeit money, the bank would likely notify authorities, leaving a permanent mark. The police force would also cross-check employment histories. For Chan to bypass this, there would need to be systemic negligence or a cover-up, which is possible but highly unlikely.

### Conclusion:  
The story contains inconsistencies, particularly around the vetting process and timeline. While it’s possible the incident was resolved informally (e.g., handled internally without legal action), the details provided are too vague to confirm. The narrative might stem from misunderstandings, exaggerations, or misinterpretations of the vetting criteria. Unless additional evidence (e.g., proof of vetting failures) is provided, the account should be approached with skepticism. [end of text]
