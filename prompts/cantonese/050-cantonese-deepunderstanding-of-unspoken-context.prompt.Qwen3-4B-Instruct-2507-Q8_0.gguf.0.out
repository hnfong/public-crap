### **Overview of the Situation**

The speaker is a young individual (implied to be from a lower socioeconomic background, possibly in Hong Kong or a similar urban environment) who is expressing frustration over the difficulty of finding employment. He observes that many job seekers—especially young people—are struggling to find work, and he attributes this not to companies offering insufficient salaries or poor job conditions, but to a deeper structural issue: **the mismatch between job seekers' personal circumstances and the demands of the labor market**.

He argues that:
- Companies offer cash wages (i.e., low or immediate cash payments) to attract workers, especially in a competitive job market.
- However, individuals with no experience or education are unable to qualify for such positions.
- He personally feels that his own lack of qualifications (no experience, no formal education) makes him unemployable.
- He claims that the real problem is not with employers’ offers, but with **the job seekers themselves**—specifically, their lack of skills, qualifications, and background.
- He concludes that the reason companies cannot hire enough people is not due to poor offers, but because **many people are fundamentally unprepared or unqualified** to enter the workforce.

### **Analysis of the Problem and Its Root Causes**

While the speaker’s frustration is understandable—especially for someone who may have faced early exposure to work at a young age (e.g., starting work at 13)—his conclusion contains **significant oversimplifications and misrepresentations of the real labor market dynamics**.

#### 1. **Misunderstanding of "Cash Wage" as a Recruitment Tool**
The speaker claims that companies use "cash wages" to attract workers. This is misleading. In reality, **low wages are not a strategic tool to attract workers**—they are often a symptom of poor labor market conditions, such as:
- Automation and technological displacement
- Global competition (e.g., outsourcing)
- Structural unemployment in certain sectors
- Lack of investment in vocational training or education

Moreover, offering low wages to attract workers is not sustainable or ethical in the long term. It leads to high turnover, poor productivity, and social instability.

#### 2. **Overgeneralization of "No Experience or Education" as a Barrier**
The speaker assumes that people without experience or formal education are inherently unemployable. This is a **flawed and outdated view**. In modern economies, especially in cities like Hong Kong, many jobs—especially in service, retail, and logistics—do not require formal degrees. Instead, they value **skills, attitude, adaptability, and on-the-job training**.

Furthermore, many young people enter the workforce through apprenticeships, part-time jobs, or vocational training programs. These pathways are often overlooked or dismissed by those who assume that only "qualified" individuals can work.

#### 3. **Ignoring Systemic Issues**
The speaker blames job seekers for not being able to find work, but **fails to acknowledge the systemic problems**:
- Lack of access to quality education or vocational training
- Poor job placement services
- Discrimination based on age, background, or gender
- Economic downturns and industry shifts (e.g., decline in manufacturing, rise of gig economy)

For example, many young people in Hong Kong face **high housing costs, limited job opportunities, and poor social mobility**, which are not personal failings but structural challenges.

#### 4. **The "13-Year-Old Work Experience" Argument**
The speaker claims that he is okay with working hard and even starting at 13. While this may reflect personal resilience, it does not negate the **ethical and developmental concerns** of child labor. In most developed economies, including Hong Kong, **child labor is illegal and discouraged** due to its negative impact on education, health, and long-term development**.

Even if someone starts working early, it does not equate to being "prepared" for the modern workforce. The skills needed today—digital literacy, communication, problem-solving—are not developed through early manual labor alone.

### **Do I Agree with His Conclusion?**

**No, I do not agree with the conclusion that "the problem is with the job seekers"**.

While some individuals may lack qualifications, **the root cause of unemployment is not personal failure—it is systemic**. The labor market is shaped by:
- Inadequate education and training systems
- Poor policy support for youth employment
- Economic shifts and automation
- Inequality in access to opportunities

Blaming job seekers for not being able to find work **shifts responsibility away from institutions and policymakers**, and it can lead to **discrimination, stigma, and social exclusion**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The speaker expresses genuine frustration with the current job market, and his personal experience is valid. However, his analysis is **overly simplistic and ethnocentric**, attributing unemployment to individual shortcomings rather than broader structural issues. 

A more balanced and constructive approach would recognize:
- The need for better vocational training and job placement services
- The importance of inclusive education policies
- The role of government and private sector in creating fair and accessible employment opportunities

In short: **The problem is not that people are unqualified—it is that the system is not designed to help them become qualified.**
