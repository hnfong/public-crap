Okay, user wants me to translate some "Chinglish" phrases into Cantonese. These are clearly Hong Kong internet-era slang mixed with English and Cantonese. The user seems familiar with Hong Kong culture since they provided examples like "nei ho" for "你好". 

Hmm, let me analyze these one by one. First phrase "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" - "gor" is probably "good", "doe" is "do", "yau" is "you", "bin" is "and", "tai lo" is "to lose". So it's about doing something good but also losing something? Maybe "good luck but lose something"? 

Second one "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?" - "ngor ng" is "no problem", "use" is "use", "fai zi gah" is "for free", "use chi gang" is "use it or lose it", "duck ng duck" is "give up". So it's about using something for free but it might be lost if not used? 

Third phrase "mud yeah lei ga?" - "mud yeah" is "what about", "lei ga" is "leisure activities". Seems like asking about leisure activities. 

Fourth one "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" - "but" is "but", "yuu" is "you", "yat chai" is "want to go", "yum cha" is "have dim sum". So "but you want to go have dim sum"? 

Fifth phrase is longer: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" - "password", "send", "yahoo email". Probably about sending a password to someone's Yahoo email? 

Sixth one "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga" - "farn hok" is "far out", "ho sun" is "have fun", "fu lor" is "for luck", "gei si" is "give up", "sin fong ga" is "give up". So "far out have fun for luck, give up give up"? 

Seventh phrase "yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok..." - "yau chin" is "what's up", "lar" is "what", "daap sik" is "so tired", "si" is "is". So "what's up what so tired is...". 

Eighth one is tricky: "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung" - "kui doe" is "quick do", "9 ng connect 8 ge" is "9 and 8 connect", "man kui" is "maybe quick", "yat yeung" is "go up", "yeah kui" is "you're right", "jau darp dai yeung" is "just a little bit different". 

Ninth phrase "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju" - "need boot" is "need to boot", "gei" is "give", "wait me" is "wait for me", "ng hoe hoi chi ju" is "I'm going to take a break". 

Tenth one "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai" - "yap sat" is "what's wrong", "yim sat" is "what's wrong", "gum gan" is "with", "gap zai" is "what's wrong". 

User seems to be either a native Hong Konger or someone studying the language. They're probably testing my understanding of this unique blend of Cantonese and English. The examples show they know the basics, but these phrases are more complex. 

I should be careful with the translations because some phrases might have double meanings or be internet slang from that era. The user didn't specify if they want literal translations or more natural Cantonese equivalents, so I'll aim for accurate but slightly colloquial versions. 

Also, user provided examples but didn't ask for explanations, so I shouldn't over-explain unless they ask. Just give clean translations. 

Let me check if all these phrases are correctly interpreted. The eighth one is the most complex, I might need to verify that one twice. The others seem straightforward. 

Okay, I think I've got them all. The translations should be helpful for someone learning Cantonese or understanding Hong Kong internet culture from the 90s. User seems knowledgeable but might appreciate the breakdown of how these phrases work.
