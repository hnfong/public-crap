Sure! Here's a simple English translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah. Me too.  
I like to play a lot, but I never gamble, you know.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don’t gamble on Big2 either, actually. ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe’s house, right?

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, “Sure, let’s play.”  
Then he said, “1 cent per card”... (because he plays really well).  
I thought, “That’s okay”... besides, I’d only lose like $10 at most.

**Alice:**  
That’s fine.  
:)  
Hehe. It’s fun to play with you, but if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to be too strict about it, you know...  
If you have to gamble, it’s stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
No program.  
No.  
I don’t need to download or anything.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Of course, to play online you need a program.  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:**  
Okay.  
:)  
Thanks.  
Hehe.
