Here is the translated conversation between Alice and Bob in simple English:

## Alice:
Haha. Yeah, me too. I really like to play games, but I never gamble, lol.

## Bob:
Oh… I also never gamble on Big2 ;-). Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago? What happened?

## Bob:
I went to a friend’s house, and they wanted to play Big2. They said they would only bet 1 cent per card because they’re really good at it. I thought it wasn’t a big deal, so I agreed. At most, I lost about $10.

## Alice:
That’s not too bad, haha. Actually, it’s okay if you don’t gamble; you can still enjoy the game. But if you do gamble, you might not be able to fully enjoy it.

## Bob:
It’s not very good to risk so much money, especially when it’s stressful. By the way, do you have the program needed to play Big2?

## Alice:
I don’t have the program. Do you need to download it or something?

## Bob:
You need the program to play online. My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP. Let me check…

## Alice:
Oh, okay. Hehe, thanks!
