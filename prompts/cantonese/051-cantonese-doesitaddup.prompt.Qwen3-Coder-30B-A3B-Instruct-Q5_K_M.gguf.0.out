This story seems highly suspicious and unlikely to be true for several reasons:

**Red flags in the story:**

1. **Implausible timing**: The commenter claims to have been a "前同事" (former colleague) of Chen Dawen, but then says they "shadowed" him during his first week of employment. This creates a logical contradiction - if they were colleagues, they would have been working together, not shadowing each other.

2. **Unrealistic scenario**: The story describes a situation where someone is "fired for being too good" (衰穿櫃桶底) and then immediately gets a police job. This is extremely unlikely - if someone was fired for being too efficient, they would be a valuable asset to any employer, not someone who would be fired.

3. **Inconsistent details**: The story mentions "某間英資大行" (a major British bank) but doesn't specify which one, making it hard to verify. Also, the description of the firing process seems overly dramatic and theatrical.

4. **Suspicious motivation**: The story appears to be a negative character assassination attempt, possibly to discredit someone who has been awarded for their police work.

**Why I don't buy it:**
- The story lacks credibility and seems to be fabricated
- It appears to be an attempt to undermine someone's reputation
- The details are too convenient and dramatic to be genuine
- The timing and relationships described don't make logical sense

This sounds like a malicious rumor or fabricated story rather than a genuine account. [end of text]
