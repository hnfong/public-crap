Here’s a simpler translation of the conversation:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games a lot, haha.  
But I never gamble, though. :)  

**Bob:**  
Oh... I never gamble on Big 2 either ;-)  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud, ah?  

**Bob:**  
Went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big 2.  
I said, “Let’s play,” but he said, “1 cent for a card...” (because he plays really well.)  
I said, “So what,” and besides, I didn’t lose much, like $10 at most, haha...  

**Alice:**  
Oh, right.  
Hehe. You’re lucky, though.  
It’s actually fun. But if I were you and had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “stand so hard,” haha...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
Meh, the program.  
No.  
Do you have to download something or something? :)  

**Bob:**  
Of course, I play online, so I need a program to play, haha...  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

**Alice:**  
How are you?  
:)  
Okay, I’ll call you later.  
Hehe.
