Based on the text provided, **I do not fully "buy" the story as an objective fact**, although it is possible that a kernel of truth exists within a highly biased narrative.

Here is a breakdown of why this comment should be treated with extreme skepticism:

### 1. Strong Indicators of Bias and Motive
*   **Timing:** The comment appears immediately after the subject (Chan Tai-man) received a public award. This timing suggests a motive to **deflate his reputation** or "cancel" his achievement by revealing a dark past. It feels like an act of retaliation or jealousy rather than a neutral sharing of information.
*   **Tone:** The language is emotional and colloquial ("衰穿櫃桶底" - messed up badly/caught red-handed; "押住佢執野走" - escorted him out while packing). The writer seems to take pleasure in recounting the humiliation of the subject.
*   **Anonymous Source:** As a forum comment, the identity of the "former colleague" cannot be verified. Anyone can claim to be a former colleague to spread rumors without consequence.

### 2. Logical Inconsistencies and Exaggerations
*   **The "Police Vetting" Argument:** The writer questions how someone with a "character problem" passed the police vetting process.
    *   *Counter-point:* Police vetting (especially in Hong Kong) is rigorous regarding **criminal records**. If Chan was fired for theft or fraud ("衰穿櫃桶底") and the bank reported it to the police or if charges were filed, he likely would have a criminal record or at least a significant mark on his background check that would disqualify him.
    *   *Possibility:* If the bank fired him internally without pressing criminal charges (to avoid bad PR), he might not have a formal criminal record. However, the police recruitment process often includes interviews and reference checks where such a gap in employment or a termination might be raised. If he passed, either the incident wasn't as severe as the writer claims, or he successfully explained it during the interview.
*   **The Timeline:** The story says he was fired in the morning, escorted out at noon, and then "eventually went to become a police officer." The transition from being fired for cause to joining a disciplined force usually takes months or years of training. The narrative glosses over this gap, implying a direct causal link that might not exist.

### 3. The Nature of "Office Gossip"
*   **Embellishment:** In corporate environments, stories of firings often get exaggerated over time. "Messed up" could range from minor procedural errors to actual theft. The phrase "衰穿櫃桶底" is vague. Without specific details of the crime, it remains an allegation.
*   **One-Sided Perspective:** We only hear the version of the person who watched him get fired. We do not know Chan's side of the story. Was it a misunderstanding? Was he a scapegoat? Was the "colleague" actually involved in the issue?

### Conclusion
**Do I buy it?**
*   **As a confirmed fact:** **No.** There is no evidence provided other than the word of an anonymous internet user with a likely axe to grind.
*   **As a possibility:** **Yes, it is possible.** People do get fired for misconduct and later reinvent themselves in other careers, including the police force, especially if no criminal charges were laid.

**Verdict:** This reads like a **character assassination attempt** rather than a factual report. While the core event (him getting fired) might be true, the severity of the misconduct and the implication that he is currently unfit for duty are unproven allegations designed to tarnish his recent award. Until there is independent verification (e.g., news reports of his past conviction or an official statement), this should be regarded as **rumor**. [end of text]
