Okay, let's tackle this request. The user wants me to rewrite the given Chinese essay into English without translating individual words or phrases. Then, I need to comment on the essay, disregarding the sarcastic tone, and figure out the main point the author is trying to convey.

First, I need to understand the original essay. It's a Chinese text discussing the late scholar Yu Ying-shih, comparing him to another scholar, Professor Wang Weixiong, and delving into the compatibility of Confucianism with democracy, especially in the context of American academia. The author uses a sarcastic tone, making fun of how Confucian scholars like Yu Ying-shih are portrayed in the West as democratic advocates, even though Confucianism traditionally emphasizes hierarchy and order.

Wait, the user said not to translate individual words or phrases, so I should avoid translating specific terms like #余英時 or #王偉雄. Instead, I need to keep those hashtags as they are. The main task is to rewrite the entire essay into English, maintaining the structure and the hashtags but translating the rest.

Let me start by reading through the Chinese text carefully to grasp the main points. The author mentions Yu Ying-shih, a scholar associated with Professor Wang Weixiong. The author initially didn't know much about Yu but used Google to find out more. They note that Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools, which the author finds impressive. Then they compare Yu to another scholar, "Yun Gen" (云根), who they respect. The author points out that while Yun Gen didn't have a Harvard position, both share a deep knowledge of Chinese tradition.

The main argument seems to be about how Confucianism, which traditionally emphasizes hierarchy, benevolence, and ritual, is being reinterpreted in the West (specifically in the U.S.) as compatible with democracy. The author argues that this is a misrepresentation because Confucianism's historical context was about maintaining social order under a hierarchical system, not democracy. They reference historical examples like Confucius's failed attempts to gain political office by adhering strictly to ritual, versus later Confucian scholars who adapted to rulers' needs, even embracing Legalism. The author also mentions that in modern times, Confucian scholars in the U.S. are pressured to present Confucianism as democratic to fit into Western academic frameworks, which the author sees as a distortion.

The author also criticizes the idea that Chinese or Taiwanese political systems (like the Republic of China or Taiwan's government) are based on Confucianism, pointing out that Taiwan's political practices don't align with Confucian principles. They even compare Japan and the UK as having Confucian-like structures in their historical governance, with hierarchical systems and divine right of kings, but then moving towards democracy, which complicates the Confucian-democracy compatibility argument.

Now, I need to rewrite this into English. Let me make sure I don't translate the hashtags. So #余英時 stays as #余英時, #王偉雄 as #王偉雄, etc. The user specified not to translate individual words or phrases, so terms like #博古通今, #我即華夏, #尊師重道, #個人主義, #五四運動, #守孝三年, #民主, #理論核彈 should remain as they are, but the rest of the text needs to be in English.

Wait, the user said "No need to translate any individual words or phrases." So I shouldn't translate the hashtags or specific terms. So I'll keep those as they are. For example, #博古通今 stays as #博古通今, not translated to something like "erudite" or "well-versed in ancient and modern affairs." The same goes for other hashtags.

Let me start translating the essay. Let's go paragraph by paragraph.

First paragraph: "三小時前放工返屋企上網，見到有人悼念 #余英時 。當時，我淨係知佢係名博客 #王偉雄 教授嘅偶象，除此以外對佢嘅生平一無所知。"

Translation: Three hours ago, after work, I went home and went online, seeing someone mourning #余英時. At that time, I only knew he was the idol of blogger #王偉雄 professor, and knew nothing else about his life.

Wait, but the user said not to translate individual words or phrases. So "放工返屋企上網" should be translated as "after work, went home and went online," but not translate each word. So "放工" is "after work," "返屋企" is "went home," "上網" is "went online." So the translation would be "Three hours ago, after work, I went home and went online, seeing someone mourning #余英時. At that time, I only knew he was the idol of blogger #王偉雄 professor, and knew nothing else about his life."

Wait, but "博客" is "blogger," so #王偉雄 教授 is "Professor #王偉雄," but the user said not to translate individual words, so "博客" should stay as "blog," but "blogger" is the English term. Wait, the instruction says "No need to translate any individual words or phrases." So "博客" is a Chinese term for blog, but in English, it's "blog," so maybe "blogger" is acceptable. Wait, but the user says not to translate individual words, so maybe "blog" should be kept as is? Wait, but "博客" is a Chinese word for blog, so in the translation, it's "blog," but the instruction says not to translate individual words. Hmm. Wait, the user says "No need to translate any individual words or phrases," so I should leave "博客" as "blog" but in the translation, it's "blogger" as a term. Wait, maybe the user means not to translate specific terms like #余英時, but the rest should be translated. So "博客" would be translated to "blogger," since it's a common term. The instruction is a bit ambiguous, but the example given in the problem statement says "No need to translate any individual words or phrases," so probably keep the hashtags as they are, but translate the rest of the text normally. So "博客" becomes "blogger," "教授" becomes "professor," etc.

Wait, but the user says "No need to translate any individual words or phrases," so maybe they mean not to translate the Chinese terms into English, but the essay is in Chinese, so the translation should be into English, but not translate specific terms like #余英時. So the hashtags should remain as #余英時, #王偉雄, etc., but the rest of the text should be translated into English. So "博客" would be translated to "blogger," since it's a common English term. So "名博客 #王偉雄 教授" becomes "blogger #王偉雄 professor." Wait, but "名博客" is "a blogger," so "a blogger #王偉雄 professor." Wait, but "博客" is the Chinese term for blog, so "blogger" is the English equivalent. So the translation would be "I only knew he was the idol of blogger #王偉雄 professor, besides which I knew nothing about his life."

Wait, but the original says "名博客 #王偉雄 教授嘅偶象," so "a blogger #王偉雄 professor's idol." So "I only knew he was the idol of blogger #王偉雄 professor, and knew nothing else about his life."

Okay, moving on. "不過 21 世紀唔使下下請教 #老師s，有 Google 就可知天下事。查咗一輪之後，越嚟越明白點解佢咁出名，同埋點解王教授咁鍾意提起余老⋯⋯"

Translation: However, in the 21st century, you don't need to ask #老師s every time; with Google, you can know everything. After a round of searching, I gradually understood why he was so famous, and why Professor Wang liked to mention Old Yu...

Wait, "查咗一輪之後" is "after a round of searching," "越嚟越明白" is "the more I understood," "點解佢咁出名" is "why he was so famous," "點解王教授咁鍾意提起余老" is "why Professor Wang liked to mention Old Yu."

"余老做過三間長春藤學校嘅教授喎！威唔威先！淨係撻朵都嚇死人啦！"

Translation: Old Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! Impressive, isn't it! Just the mention of it is terrifying!

Wait, "長春藤" is Ivy League, so "three Ivy League schools." "威唔威先" is "isn't it impressive?" "淨係撻朵都嚇死人啦" is "just the mention of it is terrifying!" So "Old Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! Impressive, isn't it! Just the mention of it is terrifying!"

"I就好似stalker咁不斷摷余英時嘅背景資料：中文維基百科點寫佢呀，英文維基百科點寫佢呀，得獎嗰陣啲人點樣吹捧佢呀，以至今日啲訃文點講佢呀，我腦海浮現一個我最尊敬嘅人⋯ 云根老師。真係幾似架！"

Translation: I acted like a stalker, constantly digging up Yu Ying-shih's background: how Chinese Wikipedia writes about him, how English Wikipedia writes about him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how today's obituaries talk about him. In my mind, a person I respect the most appeared... Yun Gen teacher. It's really similar!

"可惜根老師冇哈佛大學教席，不過佢哋 #博古通今 、#我即華夏 嘅傳統中華功夫就肯定係同出一轍。根老師鍾意道家佛家，余老似乎就係儒家fans嚟。"

Translation: Unfortunately, Teacher Yun Gen doesn't have a Harvard position, but their #博古通今, #我即華夏 traditional Chinese skills are definitely the same. Teacher Yun Gen likes Taoism and Buddhism, while Old Yu seems to be a Confucian fan.

"不過咁就慘嘞。

儒家講究嘅係仁義禮智信、長幼有序、君君臣臣；不過若果你喺美國頂尖大學讀書，啱啱喺嬉皮士最盛行嘅年代考到個 PhD 返嚟，唔通真係周圍教人要 #尊師重道，唔好搞咁多 #個人主義 嘅嘢咩。咁會揸兜架。"

Translation: But that's a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness; orderly seniority and the proper roles of ruler and minister; however, if you study at an elite university in the U.S., just as hippies were most prevalent, and you return with a PhD, are you really going to teach people to #尊師重道 and not engage in too much #個人主義? That would be a disaster.

"話說，做學者點樣避免揸兜，係孔夫子用咗一世嘅辛酸換返嚟嘅學問，儒家門生冇可能唔識：孔老夫子嘅年代，天下大亂將至，佢周遊列國，希望求得一官半職，做一番大事。但係佢淨係識得背書講周公禮法，唔識得迎合老細需要，最後無功而回。不過，失敗乃成功之母，佢啲學生就進步得多喇。太史公曰：「七十子之徒散游諸侯，大者為師傅卿相，小者友教士大夫。」點解嘅？

Because of the hardships Confucius endured throughout his life, his students learned how to avoid such disasters. The Confucian disciples couldn't possibly not know: in Confucius's time, the world was about to descend into chaos, and he traveled around various states hoping to secure an official position to accomplish great deeds. However, he only knew how to recite and speak about the rituals of Duke of Zhou, not how to cater to his superiors' needs, and ultimately returned without success. But, failure is the mother of success; his students advanced much more. Sima Qian said: "The seventy disciples scattered to serve various states, with the larger ones becoming teachers, ministers, and high officials, and the smaller ones befriending and teaching scholars and officials." Why?

"因為經過幾代傳承，佢哋開始識睇君主眉頭眼額。去到孟子年代，佢同國君嘅互動已經有啲唔同，有講有笑，識得𠱁老細：齊王，我睇你連隻牛牛都唔忍心殺，肯定係仁君嚟啦！行王道，你得嘅！

Because through generations of传承, they began to read the rulers' intentions. By Mencius's time, his interactions with the rulers were different; they could chat and laugh, knowing how to flatter the boss: "Lord Qi, I see you can't bear to kill even a cow, so you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the Way of the King, and you'll succeed!"

"去到戰國末期，啲「儒家」策士玩「國君面試」嘅遊戲已經出神入化。為咗做官「仁」、「禮」都抛棄晒，個個走去鑽研「法治」呢個新科技。所以荀子作為儒家門人，教出嚟嘅學生可以做秦始皇政府嘅高官，你喺李斯身上，梗係完全聞唔到半分孔夫子嘅氣息。"

By the end of the Warring States period, the "Confucian" strategists had mastered the "king's interview" game. To get official positions, they abandoned "benevolence" and "ritual," and everyone turned to studying "Legalism," this new technology. So Xunzi, as a Confucian disciple, taught students who could become high officials in the Qin Shi Huang government; on Li Si, you could completely smell no trace of Confucius.

"今日聯合國百幾二百個國家，形勢比春秋時代更複雜。儒家傳人離開中國呢個(上古嘅)禮儀之邦，去到荒蠻之地軍事霸權美國，唔通真係拎本《論語》出嚟叫人 #守孝三年 咩。當年孔夫子帶住班學生食閉門羹有幾柒，大家都耳熟能詳。所以，去到美國，孔子門生梗係話夫子都支持 #民主，#民主大法好，共產黨仆街陷家鏟，咁先有長春藤教授做架嘛！

Today, the United Nations has hundreds of countries, and the situation is more complex than the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leave China, this (ancient) land of ritual, and go to the barbaric land of military hegemony, the United States. Are they really going to pull out the Analects and tell people to #守孝三年? Back then, Confucius and his students were turned away countless times, which everyone is familiar with. So, in the U.S., Confucian disciples would definitely say that Confucius supported #民主, #民主大法好, the Communist Party is doomed, and only then can they become Ivy League professors!

"可能有人問：乜鳩噏冇後果架咩？梗係冇啦！孔子孟子兩千幾年前就死咗，儒家傳統喺 #五四運動 俾人砸爛晒。作為二戰後唯一強國嘅頂尖大學學術權威，你話其實 Johnny Kung 教人吸毒玩女人都可能有人信呀，始終美國啲 #理論核彈 係堅料嚟，日本仔唔信邪嘅後果，當年大家歷歷在目。

Maybe someone asks: What's the consequence? Obviously, there's none! Confucius and Mencius died thousands of years ago, and the Confucian tradition was smashed during the #五四運動. As the academic authority of the top university in the only superpower after WWII, you'd say that Johnny Kung teaching people to take drugs and play with women might even be believed, after all, America's #理論核彈 are solid, and the consequences of Japanese defiance are still vivid in everyone's memory.

"所以點解余老當年可以隨便抽幾句《漢書》嘅內容翻譯成英文就攞到個 PhD ，仲有幾間大學請佢做教授呢？ #你懂的 。推你上神台做權威，就係想你實牙實齒咁講：「在坐各位都係臘鴨，你以為孔夫子思想係封建？哎呀，誤會真大！其實佢先至係民主鬥士呀！你哋冇哈佛教席就乖乖聽書啦！」

So why could Old Yu easily translate a few sentences from the Book of Han into English and get a PhD, and have several universities invite him to be a professor? #你懂的. Pushing you onto the pedestal as an authority is to have you say with full teeth: "All of you here are ducks, you think Confucius's thoughts are feudal? Oh, what a big misunderstanding! In fact, he was the democratic fighter! Since you don't have a Harvard chair, just listen to the lecture!"

"至於儒家思想係咪同民主有衝突？講真，呢啲嘢，「漢學家」識條鐵咩。你話：中華民國就係例子。喂大佬，人哋台灣政治體制撚係「儒家」咩？國民黨班撚頭日日屌鳩蔡英文，儒家係咁玩架咩？蔡英文有冇作晒狀咁拜天祭地？冇吖嘛。科學精神，唔做神棍，有違儒家宗旨。你以為用漢字就係儒家？你以為儒家淨係中國先可以有？

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy? Honestly, these things, "sinologists" know nothing about. You say: the Republic of China is an example. Hey boss, Taiwan's political system is "Confucian"? The Kuomintang leaders constantly berate Tsai Ing-wen, is that how Confucianism works? Did Tsai Ing-wen perform all those rituals of worshiping heaven and earth? No, she didn't. Scientific spirit, not being a mystic, goes against Confucian principles. Do you think using Chinese characters makes it Confucian? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

"正如我早前所講，日本就係儒家，英國就係儒家 (起碼世界先進國家嚟講最似儒家就係佢哋)：國君講禮儀排場，權力由上天所賜，至高無上，唔屌得，大家一層層階級，冇得越級挑戰，社會先至穩定。至於佢哋搞民主制嘅成敗得失，就唔係一個美籍中國人有資格說三道四喇。"

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, the UK is Confucian (at least among advanced countries, they are the most similar to Confucianism): the king emphasizes rituals and pomp, power is bestowed by heaven, supreme and unchallengeable, everyone in hierarchical layers, no crossing of ranks, and society is stable. As for their successes and failures in establishing a democratic system, it's not something a Chinese-American is qualified to comment on.

Wait, let me check if I translated all the hashtags correctly. The original has #余英時, #王偉雄, #博古通今, #我即華夏, #尊師重道, #個人主義, #五四運動, #守孝三年, #民主, #理論核彈, #你懂的. So in the translation, I should keep those as they are. Let me confirm:

- #余英時 → #余英時
- #王偉雄 → #王偉雄
- #博古通今 → #博古通今
- #我即華夏 → #我即華夏
- #尊師重道 → #尊師重道
- #個人主義 → #個人主義
- #五四運動 → #五四運動
- #守孝三年 → #守孝三年
- #民主 → #民主
- #理論核彈 → #理論核彈
- #你懂的 → #你懂的

Yes, those are all kept as is.

Now, the next part is to comment on the essay, disregarding the sarcastic tone, and state the main point the author is trying to convey.

The main point, ignoring the sarcasm, is that the author is arguing that Confucianism, as traditionally understood, is incompatible with democracy because it emphasizes hierarchical order and ritual, not individualism or democratic values. The author points out that Confucian scholars in the West, like Yu Ying-shih, are pressured to reinterpret Confucianism as democratic to fit into Western academic and political frameworks, which is a distortion of the original philosophy. The author uses historical examples (Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi) to show how Confucian thought evolved to adapt to political realities, sometimes abandoning its core principles (like benevolence and ritual) in favor of Legalism to gain power. The author also criticizes the idea that modern political systems (like Taiwan's or Japan's) are based on Confucianism, arguing that their practices don't align with Confucian principles, and that the Confucian tradition has been misrepresented in the West.

Wait, but the user says "Disregarding the sarcastic tone, what is the main point the author is trying to convey?" So the sarcastic parts are things like "威唔威先！淨係撻朵都嚇死人啦！" or "你以為用漢字就係儒家？" etc. So the main point is that Confucianism is being misrepresented in the West as compatible with democracy, when in reality, its traditional values are hierarchical and thus conflict with democratic ideals. The author is highlighting the historical adaptation of Confucianism to political power (e.g., moving from Confucian ideals to Legalism) and arguing that modern Western interpretations are a distortion.

Wait, but the author also mentions that in the U.S., Confucian scholars are pushed to present Confucianism as democratic to gain academic positions, which is why Yu Ying-shih could get a PhD and professorship by translating parts of the Book of Han and claiming Confucius supported democracy. So the main point is that the Western academic establishment co-opts Confucian scholars to present Confucianism as democratic, which is a misrepresentation, and that this misrepresentation ignores the historical context where Confucianism was about hierarchy, not democracy.

Another angle is that the author is saying that Confucianism's traditional values (like hierarchy, respect for authority) are at odds with democratic values (individualism, equality), so the attempt to reconcile them is artificial. The author uses examples from Chinese history and compares to Japan and the UK to show that Confucian-like structures existed in other societies but didn't prevent the development of democracy, so the claim that Confucianism is inherently anti-democratic is flawed. Wait, but the author says Japan and the UK are similar to Confucianism in their hierarchical structures, but they have democratic systems, so maybe the author is arguing that Confucianism isn't inherently anti-democratic, but the Western reinterpretation is a distortion. Wait, but the author's main point seems to be that the Western portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a distortion, not that Confucianism is inherently anti-democratic.

Wait, the author says: "儒家思想係咪同民主有衝突？講真，呢啲嘢，「漢學家」識條鐵咩." So the author is questioning whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy, but then argues that sinologists (Western scholars) don't understand it. The author then gives examples like Taiwan's political system not being Confucian, and Japan and the UK having hierarchical systems but still developing democracy, so the idea that Confucianism is incompatible with democracy is flawed. Wait, but the author's main point might be that the Western academic establishment is misrepresenting Confucianism to fit their own democratic ideals, rather than acknowledging its historical context.

Wait, let me re-read the essay. The author starts by talking about Yu Ying-shih being a Confucian scholar in the U.S., then points out that Confucianism traditionally emphasizes hierarchy, so how can a Confucian scholar in the U.S. promote democracy? The author then explains that Confucianism evolved to adapt to political power, even abandoning its core principles (like benevolence and ritual) for Legalism. So the author is saying that the Confucian tradition has always been pragmatic, adapting to the needs of rulers, so the current Western portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a continuation of that pragmatism, not a genuine reflection of Confucian thought. Therefore, the main point is that the Western academic portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a strategic misrepresentation to fit into Western political frameworks, rather than an accurate interpretation of Confucian philosophy.

Wait, but the author also says that Confucianism's traditional values (like hierarchy) conflict with democracy, so the Western attempt to reconcile them is a distortion. So the main point is that Confucianism, as traditionally understood, is not compatible with democracy, and the Western academic community's portrayal of it as compatible is a misrepresentation for political or academic reasons.

Wait, but the author also mentions that Japan and the UK, which have hierarchical systems similar to Confucianism, have developed democracy, so maybe the author is saying that Confucianism isn't inherently anti-democratic, but the Western interpretation is wrong. Hmm. Let me check the exact part: "正如我早前所講，日本就係儒家，英國就係儒家 (起碼世界先進國家嚟講最似儒家就係佢哋)：國君講禮儀排場，權力由上天所賜，至高無上，唔屌得，大家一層層階級，冇得越級挑戰，社會先至穩定。至於佢哋搞民主制嘅成敗得失，就唔係一個美籍中國人有資格說三道四喇."

So the author is saying Japan and the UK are Confucian (in terms of their hierarchical structures), and they have democratic systems, so the claim that Confucianism is incompatible with democracy is flawed. But the author is also arguing that the Western portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a distortion. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, no. The author is saying that Japan and the UK have hierarchical systems (like Confucianism), but they have democracy, so Confucianism isn't inherently anti-democratic. However, the Western sinologists are misrepresenting Confucianism as democratic, which is a distortion. Wait, but the author is pointing out that the sinologists are saying Confucius supported democracy, which is a distortion, but the author's point is that Confucianism's traditional values are hierarchical, so the distortion is wrong. But the author also says that Japan and the UK, which have hierarchical systems, have democracy, so maybe the author is arguing that Confucianism isn't the barrier to democracy, but the Western sinologists are misrepresenting it.

Wait, the main point is that the Western academic community misrepresents Confucianism as democratic to fit their own ideological framework, ignoring its traditional emphasis on hierarchy. The author uses historical examples to show that Confucianism has always been pragmatic, adapting to political realities (even abandoning its core principles), so the current portrayal is just another example of that pragmatism, not a genuine reflection of Confucian thought. Therefore, the main point is that the Western portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a misrepresentation, and the author is critiquing that misrepresentation.

So, disregarding the sarcasm, the main point is that Confucianism, as traditionally understood, emphasizes hierarchical order and ritual, which are incompatible with democratic values, and the Western academic community's portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a distortion for political or academic reasons.

Wait, but the author also says that Japan and the UK, which have Confucian-like structures, have democracy, so maybe the author is saying that Confucianism isn't inherently anti-democratic, but the Western sinologists are misrepresenting it. So the main point is that the Western sinologists are misrepresenting Confucianism by claiming it supports democracy, when in reality, Confucianism's traditional values are hierarchical, and the examples of Japan and the UK show that hierarchical systems can coexist with democracy, so the conflict isn't inherent. Wait, but the author's argument seems to be that the sinologists are wrong to say Confucianism supports democracy, but the author also says that Japan and the UK (which are Confucian-like) have democracy, so maybe the author is saying that Confucianism isn't the problem, but the sinologists are misrepresenting it.

Hmm. Let me try to clarify. The author's main argument is that the Western academic portrayal of Confucianism as democratic is a distortion. The author provides historical context showing that Confucianism has always been pragmatic, adapting to political needs (e.g., moving from Confucian ideals to Legalism), so the current Western claim that Confucius supported democracy is just another example of this pragmatism, not an accurate reflection. The author also points out that other societies (Japan, UK) with Confucian-like hierarchical structures have developed democracy, so the idea that Confucianism is inherently anti-democratic is flawed. However, the author's main point is that the Western sinologists are misrepresenting Confucianism by claiming it supports democracy, which is a distortion, not a genuine interpretation.

Wait, but the author says: "所以點解余老當年可以隨便抽幾句《漢書》嘅內容翻譯成英文就攞到個 PhD ，仲有幾間大學請佢做教授呢？ #你懂的 。推你上神台做權威，就係想你實牙實齒咁講：「在坐各位都係臘鴨，你以為孔夫子思想係封建？哎呀，誤會真大！其實佢先至係民主鬥士呀！你哋冇哈佛教席就乖乖聽書啦！」

So the author is saying that Yu Ying-shih was given a PhD and professorships because he supported the Western narrative that Confucius was a democrat, which is a distortion. So the main point is that Western academia co-opts Confucian scholars to promote a false narrative that Confucianism supports democracy, which is a misrepresentation of the actual philosophy.

Therefore, disregarding the sarcasm, the main point is that the Western academic community misrepresents Confucianism as compatible with democracy, ignoring its traditional emphasis on hierarchical order, and this misrepresentation is a strategic move to fit Confucianism into Western political frameworks.

Wait, but the author also argues that Confucianism's traditional values (hierarchy, ritual) are incompatible with democracy, so the misrepresentation is wrong. So the main point is that Confucianism is not inherently democratic, and the Western portrayal is a distortion.

Yes, that's it. The author's main point is that Confucianism, as traditionally understood, is not compatible with democracy because it emphasizes hierarchy and ritual, and the Western academic community's portrayal of it as democratic is a misrepresentation.

Wait, but the author also mentions Japan and the UK having hierarchical systems and democracy, so maybe the author is saying that Confucianism isn't the barrier, but the misrepresentation is still wrong. So the main point is the misrepresentation, not the inherent compatibility.

So, the main point the author is trying to convey, disregarding sarcasm, is that Western sinologists misrepresent Confucianism as democratic to fit their ideological framework, when in reality, Confucianism's traditional values emphasize hierarchy and order, which are at odds with democratic principles.

I need to make sure that's the main point. Let me check the key parts again. The author explains that Confucianism traditionally is about hierarchy, so a Confucian scholar in the U.S. promoting democracy is a contradiction. Then, the author shows that Confucianism has historically adapted (e.g., Xunzi's students becoming Legalists), so the current Western portrayal is just another adaptation. The author also points out that Taiwan's political system isn't Confucian, and Japan/UK have Confucian-like structures but democracy, so the conflict isn't inherent. But the main thrust is that the Western portrayal is a distortion.

Wait, but the author says that the sinologists are saying Confucius supported democracy, which is a distortion. So the main point is that this portrayal is a distortion, not an accurate reflection. So the main point is the misrepresentation.

Yes, so the main point is that Western sinologists misrepresent Confucianism as democratic, which is a distortion of its traditional emphasis on hierarchy and ritual.

Okay, so the comment should state that, disregarding the sarcasm, the author's main point is that Western academic interpretations of Confucianism as compatible with democracy are a misrepresentation, as Confucianism traditionally emphasizes hierarchical order and ritual, which conflict with democratic values.

Wait, but the author also says that Japan and the UK have hierarchical systems (like Confucianism) and have democracy, so maybe the author is arguing that the conflict isn't inherent, but the misrepresentation is still wrong. So the main point is the misrepresentation, not the inherent conflict. So the author's main point is that the Western portrayal is a distortion, regardless of whether Confucianism is inherently compatible with democracy.

Yes, the author's main point is about the misrepresentation, not the inherent compatibility. So the answer should focus on the misrepresentation.

Let me confirm with the essay. The author says: "所以點解余老當年可以隨便抽幾句《漢書》嘅內容翻譯成英文就攞到個 PhD ，仲有幾間大學請佢做教授呢？ #你懂的 。推你上神台做權威，就係想你實牙實齒咁講：「在坐各位都係臘鴨，你以為孔夫子思想係封建？哎呀，誤會真大！其實佢先至係民主鬥士呀！你哋冇哈佛教席就乖乖聽書啦！」

So the author is saying that Yu Ying-shih was given academic positions because he promoted the idea that Confucius was a democrat, which is a distortion. So the main point is that this portrayal is a distortion for academic and political reasons.

Therefore, the main point is that Western sinologists misrepresent Confucianism as democratic to fit their ideological framework, which is a distortion of the actual philosophy.

Okay, that's the main point. Now, to write the comment.

Wait, the user says "Disregarding the sarcastic tone, what is the main point the author is trying to convey?"

So the answer should be a concise statement of the main point, ignoring the sarcasm.

So, the main point is: The author argues that Western sinologists misrepresent Confucianism as compatible with democracy, ignoring its traditional emphasis on hierarchical order and ritual, which are fundamentally at odds with democratic principles.

Wait, but the author also mentions that Japan and the UK have hierarchical systems (Confucian-like) and have democracy, so maybe the author is saying that the misrepresentation is wrong, but the conflict isn't inherent. However, the main point is still the misrepresentation.

Yes, the key is the misrepresentation. So the main point is the misrepresentation of Confucianism as democratic by Western academics.

I think that's it. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The author uses historical examples to show that Confucianism has always been pragmatic, adapting to political needs, so the current portrayal is just another example of that pragmatism, not a genuine reflection. So the author is saying that the Western sinologists are engaging in a strategic misrepresentation to fit Confucianism into their democratic framework.

Yes, so the main point is the misrepresentation.

Three hours ago, after work, I went home and went online, seeing someone mourning #余英時. At that time, I only knew he was the idol of blogger #王偉雄 professor, and knew nothing else about his life.

However, in the 21st century, you don’t need to ask #老師s every time; with Google, you can know everything. After a round of searching, I gradually understood why he was so famous, and why Professor Wang liked to mention Old Yu⋯⋯

Old Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! Impressive, isn’t it! Just the mention of it is terrifying!

I acted like a stalker, constantly digging up Yu Ying-shih’s background: how Chinese Wikipedia writes about him, how English Wikipedia writes about him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how today’s obituaries talk about him. In my mind, a person I respect the most appeared⋯ Yun Gen teacher. It’s really similar!

Unfortunately, Teacher Yun Gen doesn’t have a Harvard position, but their #博古通今, #我即華夏 traditional Chinese skills are definitely the same. Teacher Yun Gen likes Taoism and Buddhism, while Old Yu seems to be a Confucian fan.

But that’s a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness; orderly seniority and the proper roles of ruler and minister; however, if you study at an elite university in the U.S., just as hippies were most prevalent, and you return with a PhD, are you really going to teach people to #尊師重道 and not engage in too much #個人主義? That would be a disaster.

Speaking of how scholars avoid such disasters, it’s a lesson Confucius learned through a lifetime of hardship. His disciples couldn’t possibly not know: in Confucius’s time, the world was about to descend into chaos, and he traveled around various states hoping to secure an official position to accomplish great deeds. However, he only knew how to recite and speak about the rituals of Duke of Zhou, not how to cater to his superiors’ needs, and ultimately returned without success. But, failure is the mother of success; his students advanced much more. Sima Qian said: “The seventy disciples scattered to serve various states, with the larger ones becoming teachers, ministers, and high officials, and the smaller ones befriending and teaching scholars and officials.” Why?

Because through generations of传承, they began to read the rulers’ intentions. By Mencius’s time, his interactions with the rulers were different; they could chat and laugh, knowing how to flatter the boss: “Lord Qi, I see you can’t bear to kill even a cow, so you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the Way of the King, and you’ll succeed!”

By the end of the Warring States period, the “Confucian” strategists had mastered the “king’s interview” game. To get official positions, they abandoned “benevolence” and “ritual,” and everyone turned to studying “Legalism,” this new technology. So Xunzi, as a Confucian disciple, taught students who could become high officials in the Qin Shi Huang government; on Li Si, you could completely smell no trace of Confucius.

Today, the United Nations has hundreds of countries, and the situation is more complex than the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leave China
