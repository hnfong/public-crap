Okay, so I need to translate this conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on. 

Starting with Alice. She says "hah." and "yeh. me 2." which seems like she's agreeing with something Bob said earlier, maybe about not gambling. Then she mentions she likes to play a lot but doesn't gamble, ending with a smiley. 

Bob responds, saying he doesn't gamble on Big2 either, except for a recent time a few weeks ago. So he's admitting to a rare instance of gambling. 

Alice asks if it was Joe who made him do it, using some slang like "mud ah?" which I think is a way of asking in a casual tone. 

Bob explains that he went to a friend's house, the friend wanted to play Big2, and he agreed. The friend suggested betting 1 cent per card because he's good, but Bob thought it was a small amount, so he agreed, thinking he'd only lose up to $10. 

Alice teases Bob, saying he's unlucky and that it's good he didn't lose much. She also mentions that if she had to gamble, she wouldn't enjoy the game as much. 

Bob agrees that it's not good to take it too seriously and that gambling can be stressful. He then asks if she has the program, probably referring to the game software. 

Alice says she doesn't have it and might need to download it, ending with a smiley. 

Bob explains that to play online, you need the program and offers to help her get it via FTP or HTTP. 

Finally, Alice responds with some slang, laughing it off.

Now, translating this into simple English, I need to keep the casual tone and the slang but make it understandable. I'll replace the colloquial terms with their English equivalents, keeping the flow natural. 

I should also note the slang used and provide a brief explanation so the user understands the context. 

Let me structure the translation, keeping each speaker's lines clear and the conversation flowing smoothly.

## Alice:
Hah.  
Yeah, me too.  
I like to play a lot, though.  
But I never gamble, okay? :)  

## Bob:
Oh, I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe made you do it, right?  

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I agreed to play.  
He said, "1 cent per card..." (because he's really good)  
I thought, "So what? It's just a little money..."  
Besides, I might lose at most $10 or something...  

## Alice:
You're so unlucky :)  
Hehe, but it's actually good that you didn't lose much.  
But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.  

## Bob:
But it's not good to take it so seriously...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:
What program?  
I don't have it.  
Do I need to download it or something? :)  

## Bob:
Of course, you need a program to play online...  
My client doesn't support file transfers yet...  
Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

## Alice:
Okay, I'll ask around. :)  
No need to worry.  
Hehe. [end of text]
