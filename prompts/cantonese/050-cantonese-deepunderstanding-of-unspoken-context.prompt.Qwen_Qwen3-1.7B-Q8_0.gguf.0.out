This paragraph is a personal reflection from a person who is struggling with employment. The individual is in a situation where they are being rejected by employers, despite having no experience, no education, and being 13 years old. The person is frustrated and feels that the issue is not with the employers but with the system itself.

The main problem the person is facing is that they are being passed over for jobs because of their lack of qualifications and experience, despite their willingness to work and their age. The person is questioning why companies are using cash bonuses as a way to attract candidates, and they feel that this is not a fair or effective approach.

The person concludes that the issue is not with the employers but with the system, suggesting that there is a deeper problem in the job market that needs to be addressed.

I agree with the person's conclusion. The issue is not just about the employers' offers but also about the systemic problems in the job market, such as the lack of opportunities for people with limited qualifications and the pressure on employers to hire people who are not fully qualified. This is a valid point, and it highlights the need for systemic change to address these issues. [end of text]
