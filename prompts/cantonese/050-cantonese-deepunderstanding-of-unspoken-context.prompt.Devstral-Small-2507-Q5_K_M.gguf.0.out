### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph is likely someone who has been observing the job market and is concerned about the difficulties young people (referred to as "靚仔靚妹" or "attractive young men and women") are facing in finding employment. He notes that these individuals are struggling to find jobs and are also in need of cash handouts. He questions why companies use cash handouts to attract job seekers and expresses skepticism about the qualifications of these job seekers, suggesting that they lack experience and education.

### Problems Encountered

1. **Unemployment**: Young people are finding it difficult to secure jobs.
2. **Financial Struggles**: These individuals are in need of cash handouts, indicating financial instability.
3. **Lack of Qualifications**: The person believes that many job seekers lack the necessary experience and education to be hired.
4. **Market Saturation**: There is a high number of job seekers, making it competitive and difficult for companies to find suitable candidates.
5. **Low Wages and Poor Working Conditions**: The person mentions that even if someone is hired, they often face low wages and poor working conditions.

### Conclusion

The person concludes that the root of the problem is not that companies are not offering enough, but that there is a fundamental issue with the job seekers themselves. He suggests that many people lack the necessary qualifications and are therefore unable to secure good jobs.

### Agreement with the Conclusion

While it is true that a lack of qualifications can be a barrier to employment, the conclusion that the problem lies solely with the job seekers is overly simplistic. Several factors contribute to unemployment and underemployment, including:

1. **Economic Conditions**: The overall economic climate can affect job availability.
2. **Education and Training**: The education system may not be adequately preparing students for the job market.
3. **Company Practices**: Some companies may have unrealistic expectations or discriminatory hiring practices.
4. **Government Policies**: Policies related to employment, education, and social welfare can impact job seekers' abilities to find and retain employment.

Therefore, while the lack of qualifications is a part of the problem, it is not the sole cause. A more comprehensive approach that addresses multiple factors would be more effective in tackling unemployment and underemployment. [end of text]
