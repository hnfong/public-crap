Note: In Cantonese, the word "rainmaker" is used to refer to someone who is successful suddenly or at the last minute, especially in a creative field like art or music. In the translations, I kept the word "rainmaker" to maintain the original humor and meaning.

Here are the translations with a more literal interpretation of the Cantonese:

1. He listened to music and wanted to be an artist; he's only a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
2. She didn't listen to music, but she's still a big artist; she's really a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
3. No one believed he was an artist, but many people liked his works; he's really a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
4. She can't play music, but she sells so well; she's really a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
5. He didn't listen to music without passion, but he sells so well; he's really a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
6. She doesn't listen to music, but she sells so well; she's really a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
7. He listens to music, but he doesn't sell his works; he's puzzled and a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
8. He listens to music, but he doesn't sell his works; he's puzzled and a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
9. She listens to music, but she doesn't sell her works; she's puzzled and a rainmaker (i.e., a sudden success).
