The story shared on the forum is about a former colleague of Chen Da Wen, who recently received an award for being an outstanding police officer. The commenter claims to have worked with Chen at a certain British bank for a year. Here's a breakdown of the story and an analysis of its credibility:

1. **Shadowing**: The commenter mentions that Chen shadowed them during his first week at the bank. This is a common practice for new employees to learn the ropes from experienced colleagues.

2. **Dress code violation**: The commenter claims that Chen was fired for wearing inappropriate clothing (a "tank top" or "tankini" bottom). This seems plausible, as many companies have dress code policies that employees must adhere to.

3. **Threat of legal action**: The commenter states that the boss threatened to report Chen to the police if he didn't leave immediately. This is a bit more questionable, as it's unlikely that a company would involve the police in a simple dress code violation. However, it's possible that the boss was trying to scare Chen into leaving.

4. **Escorted out**: The commenter claims that Chen was escorted out of the building by security after lunch. This is a common practice for employees who have been fired.

5. **Becoming a police officer**: The commenter mentions that Chen eventually became a police officer. This is a significant change in career path, but it's not unheard of for people to switch careers, especially if they have a strong desire to serve their community.

6. **Character issues**: The commenter claims that Chen had "some character issues" and doesn't know how he passed the vetting process for becoming a police officer. This is the most questionable part of the story, as it's difficult to verify without more information. However, it's possible that Chen has changed since his time at the bank, or that the vetting process didn't uncover his past issues.

In conclusion, while some parts of the story seem plausible, others are more questionable. It's difficult to verify the truth of the story without more information. However, it's important to remember that everyone has a past, and people can change over time. It's also possible that the commenter has a personal grudge against Chen and is trying to discredit him. Therefore, it's best to approach this story with caution and consider all possible perspectives. [end of text]
