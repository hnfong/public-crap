Alright, I need to translate and answer the given Chinese question. The text provided is a mix of Cantonese and standard Chinese, which might make it a bit challenging to understand at first glance. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the text carefully to grasp its overall meaning. The text seems to be a rant or a complaint about a live performance experience. The author is expressing frustration and anger towards something that happened during the event. There are several key phrases and expressions that indicate the author's negative feelings.

Now, let's address each part of the question one by one.

**Part (0): 簡略解釋以上文字**
This part asks for a brief explanation of the text. From what I can gather, the author is describing a live performance that they found disappointing. They mention that the event was their most special moment in life, but it didn't live up to their expectations. The author is particularly upset about the audience's lack of reaction, such as not clapping or cheering, and instead, they demanded an encore in an unexpected way. The author is also frustrated with the audience's behavior and questions their worthiness of watching live performances.

**Part (1): 作者是甚麼人？**
This question is asking about the author's identity. The text doesn't provide explicit information about the author's name or background. It seems like the author is someone who attended a live performance and had a negative experience, but there's no additional context given.

**Part (2): 他為甚麼發脾氣？**
Here, I need to explain why the author is angry. Based on the text, the author is upset because the live performance didn't meet their expectations. They describe it as their most special moment in life, but it turned out to be disappointing. Additionally, the audience's lack of enthusiasm, such as not clapping or cheering, further fueled the author's frustration. The unexpected demand for an encore and the audience's behavior also contributed to the author's anger.

**Part (3): 根據上文，「睇live」有甚麼注意事項？**
This part asks about the注意事项 (cautions or things to be mindful of) related to watching live performances based on the text. The author seems to be warning that Hong Kong people might not be worth watching live performances because they return to listening to recordings instead. This suggests that the author believes the audience lacks engagement or appreciation for live performances, indicating that one should be cautious about attending live events if they expect a lack of enthusiasm or participation from the audience.

**Part (4): 請用比較禮貌、合適的文字，重新表達原文的原意。**
Finally, I need to rephrase the original text in a more polite and appropriate manner while preserving its original meaning. This requires softening the language to make it less confrontational but still conveying the author's frustration and disappointment.

In summary, the text is a personal account of a disappointing live performance experience, highlighting the author's anger towards the audience's lack of engagement and the overall unsatisfactory event.
