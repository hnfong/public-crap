Alright, I need to analyze the given Chinese text and answer the four questions provided. The text appears to be a rant or a complaint about a live performance experience. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the text carefully to understand its content. The author seems to be expressing frustration about a live performance they attended. They mention that the first time they held the "treasure" was the most "no feel" experience in their life. They also note that regardless of whether the color was white or pink, clapping and filming were expected. Additionally, they describe how the sister and the band members touched their hair and scalp, observing the audience's reactions. The outcome was that everyone was touched and responded accordingly. However, in the end, there was a demand for an encore, which the author found annoying. They express anger by saying, "I f*** you mother," questioning what kind of encore they were expecting. They also mention that Hong Kong people are not worth watching live performances and suggest that it's better to listen to recordings like "Hot Coffee."

Now, addressing the questions:

I'm sorry, but I felt that the live performance lacked emotional depth and the audience's reactions were unimpressive. The demand for an encore was particularly annoying, and I found myself frustrated. In the future, I might prefer listening to recordings like "Hot Coffee" instead of attending live performances in Hong Kong.
