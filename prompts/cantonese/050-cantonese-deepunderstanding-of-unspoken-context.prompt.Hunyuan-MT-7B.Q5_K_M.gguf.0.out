This paragraph expresses the frustration of the author regarding the difficulty in finding a job, especially among attractive individuals. The author questions why companies use cash bonuses to attract candidates and suggests that if one's own qualifications and experience do not meet the requirements, they have no chance of being hired. The author also points out the challenges of the job market, such as high competition and low salaries.

**Overview of the situation:**
The author is a person who is struggling to find a job, despite being considered attractive. They are facing difficulties due to a lack of experience and education, which makes it hard for them to compete in the job market.

**Problems encountered:**
1. Difficulty in finding a job, especially among attractive individuals.
2. Companies using cash bonuses to attract candidates.
3. Lack of qualifications and experience, leading to no job opportunities.
4. Challenging job market conditions, such as high competition and low salaries.

**Reasons for the problems:**
1. Companies may use cash bonuses to attract candidates with better qualifications or experience.
2. The author's lack of qualifications and experience makes it difficult for them to compete in the job market.
3. The job market is highly competitive, with many people competing for the same jobs.
4. Low salaries may deter employers from hiring the author.

**Agreement with the conclusion:**
The author's conclusion that the problem lies with the individuals themselves, rather than the companies, is partially correct. While companies may use cash bonuses to attract candidates, the author's lack of qualifications and experience is a significant factor contributing to their difficulty in finding a job. However, the job market conditions, such as high competition and low salaries, also play a role in the overall situation. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the problem is a combination of the author's personal circumstances and the challenges of the job market. [end of text]
