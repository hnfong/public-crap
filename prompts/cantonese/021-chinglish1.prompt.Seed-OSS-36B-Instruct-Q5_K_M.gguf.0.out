Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to remember that the user is asking to translate Chinglish (specifically Hong Kong Cantonese written with Romanization, often based on pronunciation) into Cantonese. The examples given help: like "nei ho" is "你好" (nǐ hǎo in Mandarin, but Cantonese is 你好 too, but the pronunciation is "nei5 hou2"). 

First, let's recall some common Cantonese Romanizations, especially the ones used in Hong Kong, which might be based on Cantonese pronunciation with English letters. Common terms: "nei" is 你 (you), "yau" is 有 (have), "moe" is 冇 (not have), "tai" is 睇 (watch), "sing con" is 歌唱 (singing competition? Wait the example was "tai sing con" as 睇歌唱比賽, so "sing con" might be 歌唱比賽? Wait the example 2: "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" becomes "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？" So "sing con" is 歌唱比賽? Wait "sing" is 歌 (song) maybe, "con" is 賽 (competition)? Or maybe "sing con" is 歌唱 (singing) and then "比賽" is added? Wait the original example input is "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" output "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？" So "tai" is 睇 (watch), "sing con" is 歌唱比賽? Let's check: "sing" could be "歌" (go1 in Cantonese, but maybe the Romanization here is phonetic, like "sing" for "歌" if pronounced with a Cantonese accent? Or maybe "sing" is "唱" (seng3)? Wait "歌唱比賽" is "gei1 song3 bei2 coi3" in Cantonese. Maybe the example's "sing con" is a mishearing or phonetic spelling: "song3 coi3" (唱賽) but written as "sing con"? Maybe the user's examples use a specific Romanization system, so we need to go by the examples first.

Example 1: "nei ho" → "你好" – so "nei" = 你 (ne1), "ho" = 好 (hou2). That's straightforward.

Example 2: "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" → "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？" Let's break down the input: "nei"=你, "yau"=有, "moe"=冇 (mao6, "not have"), "tai"=睇 (tai2, "watch"), "sing con"=歌唱比賽 (gei1 song3 bei2 coi3?), "ah"=呀 (a1). So "sing con" here is 歌唱比賽. Maybe "sing" is "歌" (gei1) but pronounced as "sing"? Or maybe "sing" is "唱" (seng3), but "song" is closer to "唱"? Maybe the Romanization is loose, based on how Hong Kongers pronounce Cantonese words using English letters, so it's more about sound than exact spelling.

Now let's list common Cantonese words and their possible Romanizations in this context:

- 你 (nei5) → nei
- 有 (jau5) → yau (since "yau" is common, like in example 2: "yau"=有)
- 冇 (mou5) → moe (example 2: "moe"=冇)
- 睇 (tai2) → tai (example 2: "tai"=睇)
- 呀 (a1) → ah
- 嗎 (ma1) → sometimes "ah" but example uses "ah" for 呀
- 哥 (ko1) → gor? Example 1: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – let's look at 1 first maybe.

Let's start with each question one by one:

1. gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah

First, "gor" – common in Cantonese Romanization: 個 (go3) is often "gor" (since Cantonese "go3" sounds like "gor" to English speakers). So "gor" = 個 (go3). "doe" – maybe "dou1" or "doe" as in "多" (do1)? "多" is "do1", which could be written as "doe". "yau" = 有 (jau5) from example 2. "gor" again = 個. "bin" – what's "bin"? Maybe "pian4" 邊 (side)? Or "bin1" 閒? "tai" = 睇 (tai2) from example 2. "lo" – maybe "lou4" 樓? Or "lo1" 嚟? "ah" = 呀.

Wait let's try: "gor doe" – 個多? "yau gor bin" – 有個邊? "tai lo" – 睇樓? "ah" – 呀. "睇樓" is "looking at apartments/buildings" (common Cantonese term, tai2 lou4). "個多有個邊睇樓呀？" No, maybe word order: Cantonese is SVO sometimes, but often the structure is different. Maybe "gor doe" is "多個" (do1 go3, "more")? "yau gor bin" – "有個邊" (jau5 go3 bin1, "have a side")? No. Alternatively, "doe" could be "doe" as in "dou3" 豆? No. Wait "bin" could be "ban2" 班? "gor bin" 個班 (the class). "tai lo" 睇樓 (look at buildings). "多個有個班睇樓呀？" No. Maybe "gor" is "ko2" 哥? "哥多" – no. Wait another angle: "tai lo" – maybe "tai lo" is "睇錄" (tai2 luk6, watch recording)? No. Or "lo" is "lou5" 老? "睇老" (watch the old one)? Maybe "doe" is "moe" but no, example 2 has "moe" as 冇. Wait "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – let's think of common phrases. "睇樓" is definitely a term (looking for flats). "gor bin" – maybe "bin" is "pin4" 頻? "頻道" (pin4 dou6) but "bin" alone? Or "bin1" 邊 (which side). "多個有個邊睇樓呀？" Maybe "你有多個邊睇樓呀？" but no "nei". Wait maybe "gor doe" is "go1 do1" 個多 (that much)? "yau gor bin" 有個邊 (has a side)? No. Alternatively, "doe" could be "deo1" 道? "個道" (that road)? "有個邊睇樓呀？" Maybe "個道有個邊睇樓呀？" (Does that road have a side to look at buildings?) No, maybe I need to check other examples first.

Example 3: "mud yeah lei ga?" → let's hold that thought. Example 5: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" – "password" is English, "send" is English, "yahoo email" is English. "gor"=個, "nei"=你, "lu" – maybe "lou4" 樓? Or "lu1" 路? "jor" – maybe "zoek3" zoek? Or "zo2" 佐? "hui" – "waai4" 會? Or "fai1" 發? "send jor hui nei" – "send 佐去你" (sent to you)? "佐" is "zo2" but maybe "jor" is "joek3" 咗 (completed action, like "have sent"). Oh! "咗" in Cantonese is "zo2", but sometimes Romanized as "jor" because of the ending sound. Yes! "咗" is often written as "jor" in Hong Kong Chinglish, like "eat jor" = 食咗 (ate). That's a key point! So "jor" = 咗 (zo2, past tense marker).

Example 5: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" – let's parse: "gor password" = 個密碼 (go3 mai6 ma6), "send jor" = 傳咗 (cyun4 zo2) or "send 咗" (send zo2), "hui nei" = 去你 (heoi3 nei5), "gor yahoo email" = 個雅虎電郵 (go3 jaa5 hau4 din6 mau4), "lu" – maybe "lou4" 樓? No, "lu" could be "lo4" 嚟? Or "lu1" 路? Wait the output should be Cantonese characters, so "lu" might be "lou4" but maybe "lu" is "leoi4" 裡? No. Wait "send jor hui nei" – "send 咗去你" (sent to you), "gor yahoo email" – "個雅虎電郵", so maybe "個密碼傳咗去你個雅虎電郵嚟?" (The password was sent to your Yahoo email?) "lu" could be "lai4" 嚟 (come/here), but "lu" is closer to "lou4" or maybe "lo4". Alternatively, "lu" is "lou5" 老? No. Maybe "lu" is a typo or mishearing for "lo" (嚟). Let's note "jor"=咗 (zo2) from example 5, that's important.

Example 2: "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?" – "ngor" is definitely 我 (ngo5), because "ngor" is the common Romanization for "我" in Hong Kong Chinglish (like "ngor hai ngo" = 我係我). Yes! "ngor" = 我 (ngo5). That's a big one. So example 2 has "ngor" – so 2 starts with "我". Then "ng" – maybe "ngo5" again? Or "ng4" 五? "sik" – "sik6" 食 (eat), so "sik"=食. "use" is English. "fai zi" – "fai1 zi2" 飛紙 (notes/paper)? Or "fai3 zi2" 廢紙 (waste paper)? "gah" – maybe "gaa1" 咖? Or "gaa3" 架? "chi gang" – "zi1 gong1" 紙槓? No, "chi" could be "ji1" 機 (machine), "gang" could be "gong1" 槓? Or "chi gang" is English "chicken"? No, "chi gang duck" – "duck" is English, so maybe "chi gang" is 雞腸 (gai1 cheung4) but "chi"=雞 (gai1) is not "chi". Wait "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" – "我 五 食 use 飛紙 咖？" No, "ngor"=我, "sik"=食, so "ngor sik"=我食 (I eat). "ng" – maybe "mng" but no, "ng" could be "neung4" 兩? "我兩食 use 飛紙 咖？" No. "use" is English, so code-mixed, so some English words are kept. "duck" is English, so "duck ng duck" – maybe "dok6 ngo5 dok6"? "dok6" is 啄 (peck), so "啄我啄"? Maybe "chi gang" is 豬腸 (zyu1 cheung4) but "chi"=豬 (zyu1) not "chi". Alternatively, "chi"=車 (che1), "gang"=槓 (gong1), no. Maybe "fai zi" is 肥仔 (fei4 zai2), "gah"=嘅 (ge3), so "我食肥仔嘅，食豬腸啄我啄？" That might make sense, but not sure yet. Let's confirm "ngor"=我 (ngo5) – that's solid, like "ngor ho"=我好 (I'm fine).

Example 4: "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" – "but" is English, "yuu" – "jau5" 有 but "yuu" could be "yu4" 如? "yat chai" – "jat1 chai4" 一枝 (one branch/stick) or "jat1 coi4" 一隻 (one piece)? "yum cha" is Cantonese 飲茶 (yum2 cha4, literally "drink tea", but means having dim sum tea). Oh! "yum cha" is a Cantonese term already used in English, so that's definitely 飲茶. So "yum cha"=飲茶. "lah" – "laa1" 啦. So "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" – "but 有 一枝 飲茶 啦" – maybe "不過有一枝飲茶啦？" But "but" is English, so code-mixed: "不過有一枝飲茶啦" or "但有一枝飲茶啦". "yuu"=有 (jau5) but spelled "yuu", maybe the user's Romanization is inconsistent with vowels.

Example 6: "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga" – "farn hok" – maybe "faan6 hok6" 犯惡 (commit evil)? Or "faan1 hok6" 翻學 (go back to school)? "faan1 hok6" is 翻學 (return to school), that's a common phrase. "ho sun fu" – "fo2 seon1 fu6" 否順福? No, "ho" could be "wo4" 我? "sun"=心 (sam1)? "fu"=福 (fuk1)? "lor"=羅? Or "lor4" 嚟? "gei si" – "gei1 si1" 機師 (pilot) or "gei2 si1" 給是? "sin fong" – "san1 fong1" 心豐 (happy) or "sam1 fong1" 心房 (heart room)? "ga"=咖 (gaa1) or 嘅 (ge3). If "farn hok" is "翻學" (faan1 hok6), that's possible. "翻學嚟，機師心豐嘅" – "Back to school, the pilot is happy?" Maybe, not sure yet.

Example 7: "yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok..." – "yau"=有 (jau5), "chin" – "can4" 錢? "lar"=喇 (laa1), "daap dik" – "daap3 dik1" 搭的 (take a taxi), "si"=是 (si6), "farn hok" again, maybe "翻學" (faan1 hok6). So "有錢喇，搭的是翻學..." – "Have money now, taking a taxi to go back to school..." That could make sense. "daap dik" is 搭的 (take taxi), yes, "dik" is 計程車 (taxi) in Cantonese, "搭的"=daap3 dik1.

Example 8: "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung" – lots of English here: "connect", "9", "8", "man", "yat yeung", "yeah", "kui jau", "darp dai yeung". "kui" – maybe "kwai4" 鬼? "doe" – "dou1" 多? "9 ng" – "gau2 ngo5" 九我? "connect" is English, "8 ge" – "baat3 go3" 八個? "man" – "maan4" 萬? "yat yeung" – "jat1 joeng4" 一樣 (same)? "yeah" – "je5" 耶? "kui jau" – "kwai4 jau5" 有鬼? "darp dai yeung" – "daap6 dai6 joeng4" 達大樣? Or "darp"=達 (daap6), "dai yeung"=大樣 (big face). Maybe it's a casual phrase with numbers and English, like "鬼多9我連接8個，萬一一樣耶有鬼達大樣" – not sure, but let's hold.

Example 9: "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju" – "need" English, "boot" English (maybe 開機? boot up), "gei" – "gei1" 機? "wait me" English, "ng" – "ngo5" 我? "hoe" – "fo4" 火? "hoi" – "hoi2" 海? "chi ju" – "zi1 geo2" 紙膠? Or "che4 zu2" 車租? Maybe "need boot機，等我，我火海紙膠" – no, "hoe hoi" could be "ho4 hoi2" 貨海 (sea of goods)? "chi ju"=紙膠 (zi1 geo2, cellophane)? Maybe tech terms: "boot" is 啟動 (kai1 dung6), "gei"=機 (gei1), so "need boot機"=需要啟動機器.

Example 10: "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai" – "yap sat" – "jat6 sat6" 一日 (one day)? "yim sat" – "jan4 sat6" 一月 (one month)? "gum gan" – "gum1 gan1" 緊緊 (tight)? "gap zai" – "gaap3 zai2" 夾雜 (mix)? Or "yap sat"=八日 (baat3 jat6), "yim sat"=一月 (jat1 jyut6)? Wait "yap" could be "baat3" 八 (since "baat3" sounds like "yap" to some Romanizations?), "sat"=日 (jat6). "yim"=一 (jat1), "sat"=月 (jyut6)? "gum gan"=緊緊 (gum1 gan1), "gap zai"=夾雜 (gaap3 zai2). Maybe "八日一月緊緊夾雜" – no, need better approach.

Back to confirmed terms from examples:

- 你 = nei (example 1,2)
- 好 = ho (example 1)
- 有 = yau (example 2)
- 冇 = moe (example 2)
- 睇 = tai (example 2)
- 歌唱比賽 = sing con (example 2)
- 呀 = ah (example 2)
- 我 = ngor (example 2)
- 食 = sik (likely, common)
- 咗 = jor (example 5: send jor = 傳咗/送咗)
- 飲茶 = yum cha (example 4, common term)
- 搭的 = daap dik (example 7: daap dik = 搭的)
- 個 = gor (example 5: gor password = 個密碼)

Let's redo example 2 with "ngor"=我: "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?" – "ngor"=我, "sik"=食, so "ngor sik"=我食 (I eat). "ng" – maybe "mng" but no, "ng" could be "neung4" 兩? "我兩食"=我兩個食? (My two eat?) No. "use"=用 (jung6), but here it's English "use". "fai zi" – "fai1 zi2" 飛紙 (notes, like banknotes? 飛 is paper money, 紙 is paper). "gah" – "gaa3" 架 (particle, like "嘅" but more colloquial). So "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" – "我 用 食 飛紙 架？" No, word order: Cantonese is often verb-object, so "我食飛紙架" (I eat fly paper?) No, "飛紙" could be "肥仔" (fei4 zai2, fat guy) if "fai" is "fei4" (fat) and "zi" is "zai2" (guy), misspelled as "fai zi" instead of "fei zai". Then "ngor sik fei zai gah" = 我食肥仔架 (I eat the fat guy?) No. "chi gang" – "gai1 cheung4" 雞腸 (chicken intestines), "chi"=雞 (gai1) misspelled as "chi"? "gang"=腸 (cheung4) misspelled as "gang"? Maybe. "duck" – "dok6" 啄 (peck), so "duck ng duck" = 啄我啄 (peck me peck). So maybe: "我食肥仔架，食雞腸啄我啄？" (I eat the fat guy, eat chicken intestines peck me peck?) That might be a casual, maybe silly question.

Example 3: "mud yeah lei ga?" – "mud" – "mou5" 冇? "mud" sounds like "mou5" with a "d" at the end? Or "mat6" 麥? "yeah" – "je5" 耶? "lei" – "lei4" 你 (you, familiar form). "ga" – "gaa1" 咖. So "mud yeah lei ga?" – "冇耶你咖？" No, "lei"=你, so "你係邊度呀？" is "nei hai bin dou ah?" but "mud" could be "bin dou" misspelled? "bin dou" is 邊度 (where), "mud" maybe "mou bin dou" 冇邊度? "冇邊度你咖？" (No where you?) No. "mud" could be "mot1" 唔 (not), "yeah"=係 (hai6), "lei"=你, "ga"=咖: "唔係你咖？" (Isn't it you?) But "mud" vs "mot1". Alternatively, "mud"= "mui4" 妹? "yeah lei"= 係你 (is you), "ga"=咖: "妹係你咖？" (Is the sister you?) Maybe, but "mud" is tricky.

Example 1: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "gor"=個, "doe"=多 (do1), "yau"=有, "gor"=個, "bin"=邊 (bin1), "tai"=睇, "lo"=樓 (lou4), "ah"=呀. So "個多有個邊睇樓呀？" No, word order in Cantonese questions: sometimes the object comes first. "睇樓" is 看樓 (look at flats). "有個邊"=有邊個 (which one has). Maybe "多個邊有睇樓呀？" (Which side has more looking at flats?) No, more likely: "個邊有多個睇樓呀？" (Does that side have many people looking at flats?) "個邊"=那邊 (go3 bin1), "有多個"=有好多個 (jau5 jau5 do1 go3), "睇樓"=tai2 lou4, "呀"=ah. So "個邊有多個睇樓呀？" But the input is "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "gor bin"=個邊 (go3 bin1), "doe yau gor"=多有個 (do1 jau5 go3), "tai lo"=睇樓 (tai2 lou4). Maybe the order is "gor bin doe yau gor tai lo ah" (那邊有多個睇樓呀？), which would be "個邊有多個睇樓呀？" That makes sense: "Is there many people looking at flats over there?"

Example 5: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" – "gor password"=個密碼 (go3 mai6 ma6), "send jor"=傳咗 (cyun4 zo2) or 送咗 (sung3 zo2), "hui nei"=去你 (heoi3 nei5), "gor yahoo email"=個雅虎電郵 (go3 jaa5 hau4 din6 mau4), "lu"=嚟 (lai4, particle). So putting it together: "個密碼傳咗去你個雅虎電郵嚟？" (Was the password sent to your Yahoo email?) Or "個密碼送咗去你個雅虎電郵啦？" if "lu" is "laa1" 啦. "lu" could be a mishearing for "lai4" 嚟, which is pronounced "lai" but maybe written as "lu" in Romanization.

Example 6: "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga" – if "farn hok" is "faan1 hok6" 翻學 (go back to school), "ho sun fu" – "wo4 seon1 fu6" 我順福 (I am blessed)? "lor"=羅 (lo4, name)? No, "lor" is often "lor4" 嚟 (come). "gei si"=機師 (gei1 si1, pilot), "sin fong"=心豐 (sam1 fung1, happy/content). "ga"=嘅 (ge3). So "翻學嚟，機師心豐嘅" (Back to school, the pilot is happy). Maybe "翻學嚟，我順福機師心豐嘅" (Back to school, I am blessed, the pilot is happy). Not perfect, but "翻學" is a key term.

Example 7: "yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok..." – "yau"=有 (jau5), "chin"=錢 (cin4, because "cin4" sounds like "chin" to English speakers), yes! "錢" in Cantonese is "cin4", which is often Romanized as "chin" by Hong Kongers (like "chin si"=錢是). "lar"=喇 (laa1, particle). "daap dik"=搭的 (daap3 dik1, take taxi). "si"=是 (si6). "farn hok"=翻學 (faan1 hok6). So "有錢喇，搭的是翻學..." (Now I have money, taking a taxi is going back to school...). That flows: "有錢喇，搭的是翻學嘅..." (Now I have money, taking a taxi is for going back to school...).

Example 8: "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung" – "kui"=鬼 (kwai4, a particle meaning "like" or "ghost"), "doe"=多 (do1), "9 ng"=九我 (gau2 ngo5, nine me), "connect"=連接 (lin4 zoek3), "8 ge"=八個 (baat3 go3), "man"=萬 (maan4, ten thousand), "yat yeung"=一樣 (jat1 joeng4, same), "yeah"=耶 (je5, particle), "kui jau"=有鬼 (kwai4 jau5, there are ghosts), "darp dai yeung"=達大樣 (daap6 dai6 joeng4, act big). So putting it together colloquially: "鬼多9我連接8個，萬一一樣耶有鬼達大樣" (Like so many 9 me connecting 8, if same then yeah there are ghosts acting big). Maybe it's about something like "Lots of 9s I connected to 8s, if they're the same then there are ghosts acting big" – maybe a game or numbers talk.

Example 9: "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju" – "need"=需要 (so1 joek3), "boot"=啟動 (kai1 dung6) or 開機 (hoi1 gei1), "gei"=機 (gei1), "wait me"=等我 (dang6 ngo5), "ng"=我 (ngo5), "hoe"=火 (fo4), "hoi"=海 (hoi2), "chi ju"=紙膠 (zi1 geo2, cellophane) or 車租 (che4 zu1, taxi fare). Maybe tech: "需要開機，等我，我火海紙膠" no. "hoe hoi" could be "貨海" (fo4 hoi2, sea of goods), "chi ju"=雜貨 (zaap6 fo4), but "chi ju" is more likely "紙膠". Maybe: "需要開機，等我，我火海紙膠" – no, better: "需要啟動機器，等我，我會處理紙膠" (Need to boot the machine, wait for me, I'll handle the cellophane). But "hoe hoi chi ju" might be "會海紙膠" (wo4 hoi2 zi1 geo2, will sea cellophane) – no, maybe "ng hoe hoi"=我會來 (ngo5 wo4 loi4, I will come) if "hoe" is "wo4" (會) misspelled, "hoi"=來 (loi4) misspelled. Then "need boot機，等我，我會來紙膠" – no. Maybe "chi ju"=車租 (che4 zu1), "我會來車租" (I will come for taxi fare).

Example 10: "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai" – "yap sat"=八日 (baat3 jat6, eighth day), "yim sat"=一月 (jat1 jyut6, first month), "gum gan"=緊緊 (gum1 gan1, tightly), "gap zai"=夾雜 (gaap3 zai2, mix). So "八日一月緊緊夾雜" (Eighth day first month tightly mixed). Maybe "一日一月緊緊夾雜" if "yap"=一 (jat1), but "yap" is "baat3" in sound. Or "yap sat"=日夜 (jat6 je6, day and night), "yim sat"=陰曆 (jam4 lit6, lunar calendar). "日夜陰曆緊緊夾雜" (Day and night lunar calendar tightly mixed). Not great, but maybe "一日一月緊緊相夾" (One day one month tightly mixed).

Now let's verify the most certain ones first:

Example 7: "yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok..." – "yau"=有, "chin"=錢 (cin4→chin), "lar"=喇, "daap dik"=搭的, "si"=是, "farn hok"=翻學. So definitely "有錢喇，搭的是翻學..." (Got money now, taking a taxi is going back to school...). That's solid because "daap dik" is a known term.

Example 4: "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah" – "but"=不過 (bat1 ko3) or 但 (daan6), "yuu"=有 (jau5), "yat chai"=一枝 (jat1 chai4) or 一隻 (jat1 zoek3), "yum cha"=飲茶, "lah"=啦. So "但有一枝飲茶啦" (But there's a cup of yum cha) or "不過有一枝飲茶啦" (But there's one stick of yum cha) – "chai" could be "zoek3" 隻, so "一隻飲茶" (a portion of yum cha). So "不過有一隻飲茶啦" (But there's a portion of yum cha).

Example 5: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" – "gor"=個, "password"=密碼, "send jor"=送咗, "hui nei"=去你, "gor yahoo email"=個雅虎電郵, "lu"=啦/嚟. So "個密碼送咗去你個雅虎電郵啦" (The password was sent to your Yahoo email啦).

Example 2: "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?" – "ngor"=我, "sik"=食, "use"=用, "fai zi"=飛紙 (notes), "gah"=架, "chi gang"=雞腸, "duck"=啄, "ng"=我. So "我食飛紙架，用雞腸啄我啄？" (I eat paper notes, use chicken intestines to peck me peck?). Maybe "飛紙" is "肥仔" (fei4 zai2), so "我食肥仔架，用雞腸啄我啄？" (I eat the fat guy, use chicken intestines to peck me peck?).

Example 1: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – "gor bin"=個邊, "doe yau gor"=多有個, "tai lo"=睇樓, "ah"=呀. So "個邊有多
