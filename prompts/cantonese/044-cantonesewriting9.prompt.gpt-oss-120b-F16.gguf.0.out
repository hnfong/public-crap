<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for phrase "從頭再嚟". Format similar to example:

```
# 從頭再嚟
(pos:??)
<explanation>
yue:...
eng:...
<eg>
yue:...
eng:...
```

We need to decide part of speech. "從頭再嚟" is an idiom meaning "start over again", "do it again from the beginning". Could be used as verb phrase. So pos: 動詞短語? In Cantonese dictionary maybe "副詞"? Actually phrase functions as verb phrase meaning "to start over". Could label as "動詞". Use (pos:動詞) maybe.

Explain: "重新開始，從頭再做一次". Provide Cantonese explanation.

Example sentence: "呢個項目失敗咗，我哋要從頭再嚟。" Provide Cantonese romanization.

Also maybe another example.

Need to follow format: <explanation> block includes yue and eng lines.

Example:

<explanation>
yue:重新開始，從頭再做一次（量詞：無）
eng:to start over again; to do something from the beginning

But need to follow example: they wrote "yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）". So we can include note about usage.

Let's craft.

Also need to include Cantonese romanization with tone numbers? In example they used numbers: "lau4 bing1 coeng4". So we should provide romanization for phrase and example.

Phrase "從頭再嚟" romanization: "cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4". Actually "再嚟" is "zoi3 lei4". So "cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4". Provide.

Example: "呢個項目失敗咗，我哋要從頭再嚟。" romanization: "ni1 go3 hoeng6 muk6 sat1 baai6 zo2, ngo5 dei6 jiu3 cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4."

Add English translation.

Make sure to use Cantonese grammar: "係" maybe not needed.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 從頭再嚟
(pos:動詞)

<explanation>
yue:重新開始，從頭再做一次（量詞：無）  
eng:to start over again; to do something from the beginning

<eg>
yue:呢個項目失敗咗，我哋要從頭再嚟。 (ni1 go3 hoeng6 muk6 sat1 baai6 zo2, ngo5 dei6 jiu3 cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4.)  
eng:The project failed, so we have to start over again. [end of text]
