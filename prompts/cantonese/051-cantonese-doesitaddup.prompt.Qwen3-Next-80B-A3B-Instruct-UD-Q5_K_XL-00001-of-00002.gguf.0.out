No, I don’t buy the story — and here’s why:

### 1. **Inconsistent Timeline and Logic**
The story claims the person was fired from a bank for “衰穿櫃桶底” (a slang term implying a serious breach of trust or theft, like stealing from the vault). Yet, the story claims he was *immediately fired* and *escorted out by security the same afternoon* — which is plausible for a serious theft.  
But then, **he somehow passed police vetting** — a process that includes **criminal record checks, financial history, employment verification, interviews with references, and even psychological evaluation** — especially for a role as a police officer in Hong Kong.

If he was **fired for stealing from the vault** (“衰穿櫃桶底”), that’s not just a firing — it’s **a criminal offense**. Banks in Hong Kong (especially international ones) have strict reporting protocols for theft or fraud. If he was caught stealing from the vault, the bank would have:
- Reported it to the police immediately.
- Filed a criminal complaint.
- Coordinated with law enforcement.

**So how did he pass police vetting?**  
Police vetting in Hong Kong is extremely rigorous — especially for recruits. It includes:
- Criminal record checks (local and international)
- Employment verification (including reasons for leaving previous jobs)
- Financial background checks (debt, bankruptcy, fraud)
- Interviews with former employers and references
- Psychological evaluation

**If he was fired for stealing from the vault, there is NO WAY he passed vetting.**  
The bank would have reported it as a criminal act. Police databases would flag it. His employment record would show “terminated for theft” — and that’s an automatic disqualifier.

### 2. **The tone and details feel exaggerated or fabricated**
- “衰穿櫃桶底” is slang — but it’s not something you’d casually say in a professional context unless you’re trying to dramatize.
- The detail that “老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官” sounds like a dramatic retelling — not something a bank would say in a professional termination. Banks don’t usually threaten to “報官” on the spot — they follow HR and legal procedures.
- The fact that he “輾轉走左去考警察” after being fired for theft? That’s not just unlikely — it’s implausible. Police vetting in Hong Kong is one of the most rigorous in the world. A criminal record (even if not formally charged) for theft from a bank would be a red flag that would trigger immediate disqualification.

### 3. **Why this story feels fabricated**
- It reads like a **dramatic urban legend** or a **joke** — the kind of story people tell to shock or entertain.
- The tone is overly dramatic (“老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官”) — this isn’t how banks operate. They’d use HR, legal teams, and possibly police *after* internal investigation — not threaten on the spot.
- The idea that someone fired for bank theft could pass police vetting is **logically impossible**. Police vetting in Hong Kong is *more* rigorous than bank hiring.

---

### Conclusion: **I don’t buy the story.**

It’s either:
- A **fabricated urban legend** meant to shock or entertain,
- A **misremembered or exaggerated** anecdote,
- Or a **joke** meant to mock the idea that someone with a criminal past could become a police officer.

**Realistically?**  
If someone was fired for stealing from a bank vault, they’d be blacklisted by every financial institution and flagged by police vetting systems. **It’s impossible for them to become a police officer.**

So — **no, I don’t buy it.**  
It’s either a tall tale, a joke, or a misunderstanding.  
**In real life, this scenario is impossible.**
