**English Version:**

The person is likely a young job seeker in Hong Kong, possibly in their late teens or early twenties. They are struggling to find employment, particularly in the formal job market. They mention that employers are offering "present cash" (likely referring to cash incentives or bonuses), which they find confusing because they don't understand why companies would use such a strategy to attract job seekers. They also express frustration that they lack the necessary qualifications—such as experience and education—to be hired, and they question why employers would even consider hiring someone with no experience or education.

The person seems to have a negative outlook on the job market, believing that the lack of job offers is not just due to their own shortcomings but also because companies are not offering attractive enough positions. They mention that they started working at age 13, implying that they have been working for a long time and are not concerned about the challenges of the job market. They conclude that the real issue is that companies are not offering enough attractive job opportunities, which is why they can't find work.

**Cantonese Version:**

人哋係咁咁年青嘅職場新人，可能係18至25歲之間。人哋嘅問題係唔容易找到工，特別係正式嘅職場。人哋提到公司用「現金糧」去招人，但唔知點解公司要用現金糧去招人，又講自己唔有經驗、唔有學歷，哋點做呀？人哋又講市場咁多人真係請咗人，但話唔容易找工，唔知點解。人哋又講自己唔有條件，唔有選擇，所以唔容易找工。人哋又講自己唔介意嘅問題，但唔知點解唔容易找工。人哋最後講，唔容易找工係因為公司唔提供唔夠好嘅offer，唔係人哋唔好。

**Agreement with the Conclusion:**

The person's conclusion—that the lack of job offers is due to companies not offering attractive enough positions—is partially valid. In a competitive job market like Hong Kong, employers often use incentives like cash bonuses to attract candidates. However, the person's frustration is understandable, as they lack the necessary qualifications and experience to be competitive in the formal job market. While the job market is indeed challenging, the person's own qualifications and experience are also significant factors in their difficulty finding work. Therefore, while the conclusion is not entirely accurate, it reflects a common frustration among job seekers who feel that the job market is not working in their favor. [end of text]
