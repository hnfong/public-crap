Here's the simple English translation of Alice and Bob's conversation:

## Alice:
Haha.
Yes, me too.
I really like to play.
But I never gamble though.
 :)

## Bob:
Or... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)
Except that time a few weeks ago

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud ah?

## Bob:
Went to a friend's house
He wanted to play Big2 with me
I said "let's play"
He said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well)
I said "so hing" (that's fine) la... Besides, at most I'd lose something like $10 jeh...

## Alice:
That's okay then
Hehe. You're so lucky to get a good game
It's actually good. But if you gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully though

## Bob:
But it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...
Yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful...
BTW, do you have the program?

## Alice:
Meh program.
Moe
Hai ng hai you download or sth
 :)

## Bob:
Of course, if you want to play online, you need a program to play ga la...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

## Alice:
Hoe ark.
:)
Ng goi sai
Hehe

**Note:** This conversation appears to be in Cantonese with some English words mixed in. The speakers are discussing playing a card game called "Big2" and whether or not to gamble while playing. Some phrases like "hing" and "ng hai" are Cantonese slang that don't have direct English equivalents, so I've translated them as best as possible while keeping the conversational tone.
