### Overview of the Situation

The person in this paragraph appears to be an older individual, likely someone who started working at a young age (13 years old) and has experienced the job market from a different era. The tone suggests a sense of frustration and disbelief towards the younger generation, particularly those who are struggling to find employment. The main issue he identifies is the mismatch between the job market's demands and the qualifications or expectations of the younger job seekers. He believes that the younger generation is not meeting the basic requirements (such as experience and education) and is overly selective about job conditions, such as pay and working conditions.

### Problems Identified

1. **Mismatch Between Job Seekers and Job Market**: The person argues that many young job seekers lack the necessary experience and qualifications (e.g., education) that employers are looking for.
   
2. **Expectations vs. Reality**: He suggests that young people have unrealistic expectations about jobs, such as wanting high pay, comfortable conditions, and clear career prospects, which he believes are not aligned with the reality of entry-level positions.

3. **Employer Perspective**: The person also points out that employers are offering "現金糧" (cash wages) to attract candidates, implying that this is a sign of the difficulty in finding suitable workers.

4. **Attitude Problem**: The person concludes that the issue is not with the job market or employers, but with the attitude and qualifications of the younger generation.

### Agreement with the Conclusion

I partially agree with the person's conclusion, but with some caveats:

1. **Mismatch Between Skills and Job Market**: There is some truth to the idea that many young people may not have the exact skills or experience that employers are looking for, especially in a rapidly changing job market. However, this is not entirely the fault of the job seekers. Education systems and job training programs may not always keep up with the demands of the market.

2. **Expectations vs. Reality**: While it's true that some young people may have unrealistic expectations, it's also important to consider the broader economic context. In some cases, the low wages and poor working conditions in certain industries may not be sustainable or fair, and young people are right to question these conditions.

3. **Employer Perspective**: The use of "現金糧" (cash wages) could be a sign of the informal nature of some jobs, which may not offer the stability, benefits, or legal protections that formal employment does. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, not just from the perspective of job seekers, but also from the perspective of employers and policymakers.

4. **Attitude Problem**: While the person's frustration is understandable, it's important to recognize that the job market has changed significantly since he started working. The challenges faced by young people today are different from those of previous generations, and blaming them entirely for their struggles may not be fair or constructive.

### Conclusion

The person's conclusion that the problem lies with the younger generation's attitude and qualifications is somewhat simplistic. While there may be some truth to the idea that young people need to adjust their expectations and improve their skills, the broader issues in the job market, such as low wages, poor working conditions, and the mismatch between education and employment needs, also need to be addressed. A more balanced perspective would consider both the challenges faced by job seekers and the structural issues in the job market. [end of text]
