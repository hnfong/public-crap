They have been applying to various companies but have not received any responses, and are starting to feel frustrated and demotivated.

Overall, the person is in a difficult situation where they are facing numerous challenges in their job search. They are struggling to find a job due to a lack of experience and education, and are feeling frustrated and demotivated as a result. The person's situation highlights the challenges that many young people face in the job market, where there are often more qualified candidates than available positions.
As for whether I agree with the person's conclusion, I partially agree. While it is true that the job search process can be challenging and time-consuming, it is also important to remember that it is a normal part of life and can lead to valuable experiences and opportunities. It is important to stay positive and persistent in one's job search, and to continue learning and developing one's skills in order to increase one's chances of success. Additionally, it can be helpful to seek support and guidance from others, such as career counselors or mentors, who can provide valuable advice and encouragement.
