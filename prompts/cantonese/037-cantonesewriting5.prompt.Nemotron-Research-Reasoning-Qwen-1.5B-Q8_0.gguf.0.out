好，我现在要解决用户的问题。用户希望我用广東话造10句例句，然后翻译成英文。首先，我需要理解用户的具体要求。

用户提到要用广東話的“睇怕”这个词，所以每句例句都得以“睇怕”开头。比如例子中“威水”对应的句子，所以我要按照这个模式来。

接下来，用户还特别指出，广東話中的“的”要换成“嘅”，比如“的”写成“嘅”。所以每句例句中的“的”都要处理成“嘅”。

然后，用户要求用普通话，所以句子要口语化，自然流畅。比如“睇怕”开头，后面跟广東话的句子，然后翻译成英文。

用户给的例子是“威水”，所以我要按照这个模式生成10句广東话的例句，然后翻译成英文翻译。

现在，我需要列出10句，每句都要以“睇怕”开头，然后描述广東话的场景或表达，再翻译成英文。

比如第一个例子，威水，所以第二个可以是“睇怕香港，是香港的特别行政区。” 然后翻译成“香港是中国的一个特别行政区。”

接下来，我需要确保每句都符合要求，用“睇怕”开头，广東话表达，然后翻译成英文。

可能的10句如下：

1. 常睇怕香港，是香港的特别行政区。
2. 常睇怕澳门，是澳门的一个特别行政区。
3. 常睇怕台湾，是台湾的一个特别行政区。
4. 常睇怕新加坡，是新加坡的一个特别行政区。
5. 常睇怕日本，是日本的一个特别行政区。
6. 常睇怕韩国，是韩国的一个特别行政区。
7. 常睇怕印度，是印度的一个特别行政区。
8. 常睇怕加拿大，是加拿大的一个特别行政区。
9. 常睇怕澳大利亚，是澳大利亚的一个特别行政区。
10. 常睇怕美国，是美国的一个特别行政区。

然后，翻译成英文翻译：
