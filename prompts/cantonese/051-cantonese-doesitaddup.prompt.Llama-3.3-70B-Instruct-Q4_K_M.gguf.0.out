A juicy story! While it's impossible to verify the authenticity of the comment without more information, I'll analyze the narrative and provide my thoughts on its credibility.

Reasons to doubt the story:

1. **Sensationalism**: The comment starts with a dramatic introduction, claiming to be a former colleague of the award-winning policeman, Chen. This might be an attempt to grab attention and establish credibility.
2. **Unverifiable details**: The story relies on specific, unverifiable details, such as the name of the bank, the reason for Chen's termination (穿櫃桶底, which roughly translates to "wearing a trash can on his head"), and the alleged threat from the supervisor. These details might be exaggerated or fabricated to make the story more interesting.
3. **Convenient narrative**: The story follows a convenient narrative arc, where Chen is portrayed as a problematic individual who was fired from his previous job and then, surprisingly, becomes a successful policeman. This narrative might be too neat and simplistic to be true.
4. **Lack of concrete evidence**: The commenter doesn't provide any concrete evidence to support their claims, such as dates, names, or specific events that can be verified.

Reasons to consider the story plausible:

1. **Specific details**: The commenter provides specific details about their alleged experience with Chen, including the fact that they worked together for a year and that Chen shadowed them during his first week on the job. These details might suggest that the commenter has some knowledge about Chen's past.
2. **Plausible motivation**: The commenter's motivation for sharing the story seems to be a mix of surprise and skepticism about Chen's success as a policeman, given his alleged past behavior. This motivation appears genuine, rather than an attempt to defame Chen.

In conclusion, while the story is intriguing, I don't entirely buy it. The narrative is too sensational, and the lack of concrete evidence raises doubts about its authenticity. However, it's possible that the commenter is telling a true story, and Chen's past behavior was indeed problematic. Without more information or verification, it's difficult to say for certain.
