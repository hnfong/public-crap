Overview: The person in this paragraph is a job seeker who is reflecting on the current job market situation. He observes that many attractive young people are unable to find work and questions why companies use cash incentives to attract job seekers. He acknowledges his own shortcomings, such as lack of experience and education, and wonders how he can compete in such a market. He mentions that despite the unappealing aspects of certain jobs (such as low wages, hard work, and no future prospects), he is willing to take them because of his own limited options due to his qualifications. He concludes that the problem lies not with companies offering insufficient salaries, but with the job seekers themselves having issues.

Problem: The main problem he faces is his own lack of qualifications and experience, which makes it difficult for him to secure a job in a competitive job market. He also points out a broader issue where some job seekers might have unrealistic expectations or lack the necessary qualifications to match the jobs they desire.

Conclusion: The person concludes that the issue is not with the companies offering inadequate salaries, but with the job seekers themselves. He believes that many job seekers have problems with their own qualifications and expectations.

Agreement: I agree with his conclusion to some extent. It is true that job seekers need to have realistic expectations and align their qualifications with the job market. However, it is also important to acknowledge that the job market can be challenging for everyone, regardless of qualifications. Companies should also strive to offer fair wages and opportunities for growth. The situation is complex and involves both the supply side (job seekers) and the demand side (employers). While personal qualifications are crucial, the job market's overall health and the economy's state also play significant roles in employment opportunities.

如果用廣東話答：
綜合看來，文章講述嘅人係一個自覺自己經歷與學歷有限嘅求職者。佢面對嚴峻嘅就業市場，同時又意識到其他求職者可能有適應問題，尤其係期望與自身資質之間嘅不合。佢自己唔擅長，冇經驗，但願意接受低資格嘅工作，反映佢對現實市場嘅認識。佢最終結論係，問題唔係公司offer唔高，而係求職者自身資質有問題。

我同佢嘅結論有一部分同意。求職者需要有現實的期望，並且應該根據自己的資格去適應市場。但同時，我覺得就業市場對於每一個人來說都可能有挑戰性，不僅僅是求職者自身資格問題。公司應該同時努力提供公平的薪資和職業發展的機會。這個情況很複雜，涉及到求職者（供應方面）和雇主（需求方面）。雖然個人資質非常重要，但就業市場的整體狀況和經濟狀況也對就業機會有重要影響。 [end of text]
