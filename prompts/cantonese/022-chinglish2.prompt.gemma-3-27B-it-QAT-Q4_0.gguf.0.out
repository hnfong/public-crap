Here's a translation of the conversation into simple English, with explanations of the slang where necessary:

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah. Me too.
I really like to play Big Two a lot.
But I never gamble, though.
:)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either. ;-)
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago with Joe?

**Bob:**
Went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
I said okay, let's play.
He said one cent per card... (because he's a really good player).
I said "okay, fine"… besides, I'd only lose maybe $10 at most.

**Alice:**
Okay, fine.
:)
Hehe. You're really good at it, so it's okay.
It's good actually. But if I *had* to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to "push it" too hard…
Yeah, if there's gambling, it's really stressful.
By the way, do you have the program [to play]?

**Alice:**
What program?
A little.
It's something you have to download or something.
:)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online you definitely need a program.
My program doesn't let me send files yet… maybe I can get it to you by FTP or HTTP… wait…

**Alice:**
Okay.
:)
I'll think about it.
Hehe.



**Slang/Context Notes:**

*   **Big Two:** A popular card game.
*   **lor, gah, jeh, wor, moe, yau hai, lei gor, yuun doe gei moe sor wai, ngor juun hai yiu, fai si, so hing, gum:** These are all common Singaporean/Malaysian slang particles used to soften statements, express agreement, or add emphasis. They don't have direct English equivalents but contribute to a casual tone.
*   **"stand so hard":** Means to push your luck or be very competitive.
*   **"hoe ark":** Means "okay" or "alright".
*   **"ng goi sai":** Means "I'll think about it".
*   **FTP/HTTP:** File transfer protocols used to send files over the internet.



The conversation is about two friends discussing their enjoyment of the card game Big Two, and a small, reluctant gambling incident Bob had. Alice is hesitant about gambling, while Bob admits to a small bet but agrees it's stressful. They then discuss getting a program to play online. [end of text]
