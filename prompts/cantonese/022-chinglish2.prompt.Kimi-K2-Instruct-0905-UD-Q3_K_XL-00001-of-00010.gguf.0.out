Alice:  
Yeah, me too.  
I love playing cards, but I never bet money on them.  

Bob:  
Same here—I don’t gamble at Big Two… except that one time a few weeks ago.  

Alice:  
A few weeks ago with Joe?  

Bob:  
Went to a friend’s place.  
He wanted to play Big Two, so I joined.  
He said, “Just one cent per card” (because he’s really good).  
I thought, “Why not, it’s fun,” and figured I’d lose at most ten bucks.  

Alice:  
So you went ahead.  
Hehe. You’re still pretty cautious.  
It’s fine, but if I *had* to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

Bob:  
Yeah, being too strict about “no gambling” isn’t great either.  
True, betting makes it stressful.  
By the way, do you have the game program?  

Alice:  
What program?  
Do I need to download something?  

Bob:  
Of course you need a program to play online.  
My chat client can’t send files yet.  
Maybe grab it from my FTP or website—hang on.  

Alice:  
Okay, thanks. [end of text]
