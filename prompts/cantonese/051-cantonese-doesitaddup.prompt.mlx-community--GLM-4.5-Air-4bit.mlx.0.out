==========
This is a fascinating and complex story that raises several red flags. Let's break it down carefully to assess its credibility.

---

### 📌 **Summary of the Story**

The commenter claims to be a former colleague of an outstanding police officer named **Chen Dawen (陳大文)**. They worked together for a year at a British multinational bank. The commenter remembers Chen vividly because:

1. Chen shadowed the commenter during his first week.
2. Chen was fired from the bank for serious misconduct (“衰穿櫃桶底” – literally “rotten through the bottom of the drawer,” meaning gross misconduct or corruption).
3. The boss allegedly threatened to report him to the police unless he left immediately.
4. Later that day, security and senior management escorted Chen out while he cleared his desk.
5. Despite this, Chen somehow passed police vetting and became an outstanding officer.

### 🔍 **Analysis of Credibility**

#### ✅ **Plausible Elements**
- **Firing for misconduct**: Not uncommon in banking, especially in compliance-sensitive roles.
- **Escorted out by security**: Standard procedure for terminations involving risk of misconduct or retaliation.
- **Becoming a police officer**: Possible, depending on jurisdiction and vetting standards.

#### ❌ **Red Flags**
1. **“衰穿櫃桶底” (Gross Misconduct)**:
   - This is a very serious accusation. If true, it would likely involve theft, fraud, or ethical violations that should raise red flags in any background check.

2. **Police Vetting**:
   - Most police forces conduct thorough background checks, including employment history. A firing for gross misconduct should surface unless:
     - It was not officially recorded (unlikely in a major bank).
     - The vetting process was flawed or circumvented.
     - The misconduct was not criminal (e.g., poor performance rather than fraud).

3. **Contradiction in Reputation**:
   - The officer is now described as “outstanding,” which conflicts with a past of serious misconduct. While people can reform, the severity of the alleged misconduct makes this a stretch without further evidence.

4. **Anonymous Forum Comment**:
   - No verifiable details (e.g., bank name, dates, location). This is typical of hearsay.

### 🧠 **Possible Explanations**

| Scenario | Likelihood | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| The story is true, and Chen reformed | Low | Possible but rare given severity of alleged misconduct. |
| The misconduct was exaggerated or misinterpreted | Medium | “衰穿櫃桶底” can be colloquial and not always literal. |
| The vetting process missed something | Medium | Possible if records were sealed or not properly checked. |
| The story is fabricated or exaggerated | High | Forum posts are often unreliable; motives could include jealousy or grudge. |

### 🧾 **Conclusion: Do I Buy the Story?**

**No, not entirely.** While some elements are plausible, the story contains inconsistencies and lacks verifiable details. The most likely explanation is that:

- The commenter has a personal bias or is exaggerating.
- The misconduct was serious but not criminal, allowing Chen to pass vetting.
- Or, the story is fictional or based on partial truths.

Without corroborating evidence (e.g., official records, other witnesses), it's best to treat this as **unverified hearsay**.

If you're assessing this for legal, professional, or personal reasons due to vetting concerns, I recommend relying on official background checks rather than anonymous forum comments.
