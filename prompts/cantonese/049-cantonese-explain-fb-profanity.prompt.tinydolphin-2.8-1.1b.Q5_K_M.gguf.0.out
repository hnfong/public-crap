 1. The person you are referring to is an artist or musician known by the username "Coldplay". 
2. Coldplay is a popular rock band from the UK known for their hit songs such as "Paradise" and "Adventure of a Lifetime". They have won numerous awards and are known for their energetic live performances.
3. The phrase "live" can be interpreted in various ways. In this case, it seems to be a reference to Coldplay's performance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in the United States. In that event, Coldplay performed their hit song "Adventure of a Lifetime" as the opening number.
4. In this context, I would suggest the following alternative sentence:

"The person you are referring to is an energetic and talented musician known as Coldplay. They have performed live on the well-known TV show Saturday Night Live in the United States, and their music has been a huge hit around the world."<|im_end|>
