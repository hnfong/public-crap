Okay, let's tackle this translation. The user wants the conversation between Alice and Bob translated into simple English. First, I need to understand the context and the slang they're using. It looks like they're talking about playing a card game called Big2, and there's some casual language with phrases like "lor," "gum," and "yeh." 

I should start by identifying the key points in each message. For example, Alice says "hah. yeh. me 2." That probably means "haha. Yeah. Me too." Then she mentions liking to play games but not gambling. The smiley face at the end adds a friendly tone.

Bob responds by saying he doesn't gamble on Big2 either, except for a specific incident a few weeks ago. He goes into detail about going to a friend's house, the friend wanting to play, and the betting involved. Phrases like "gum I say play lor" might be "Hey, I said play!" and "gum he said 1 cent for a card" could be "He said 1 cent for a card."

Alice then asks if it was Joe Mud, and Bob clarifies it was a friend's house. The part about downloading a program is important too. Bob mentions needing a program to play online, and Alice responds with a smiley and some casual phrases.

I need to make sure the translation captures the casual and friendly tone. Words like "lor" and "gum" can be translated as "you know" or "hey" to keep the conversational feel. Also, the slang and informal expressions should be simplified without losing their meaning.

Another thing to watch out for is the cultural context. Terms like "Big2" might not be familiar to everyone, so I should keep it as is since it's a specific game. The references to money and betting should be clear but straightforward.

I should also check for any idioms or phrases that might not translate directly. For example, "it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor" – this seems to be about enjoying the game without gambling. Translating "ngor juun hai yiu" as "if you gamble" makes sense here.

Finally, ensuring that the translated dialogue flows naturally in English while preserving the original intent and tone. Adding appropriate punctuation and capitalization where needed to make it readable.

## Alice:  
Haha. Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing games, but I never gamble.  
:)  

## Bob:  
Right... I never gamble at Big2 either. ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:  
Was it Joe Mud a few weeks ago?  

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
Hey, I said, “Let’s play!”  
He said, “One cent for a card...” (because he plays really well).  
I said, “So what?” Besides, I’d lose at most about $10.  

## Alice:  
Hey, you’re crazy!  
:)  
Hehe. It’s actually fun, but if you gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

## Bob:  
But it’s not good to “push yourself too hard.”  
Yeah, if you gamble, it’s super stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:  
No program.  
Hey, you can download it or something.  
:)  

## Bob:  
Hey, you need a program to play online, of course...  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

## Alice:  
How?  
:)  
You’re wrong.  
Hehe. [end of text]
