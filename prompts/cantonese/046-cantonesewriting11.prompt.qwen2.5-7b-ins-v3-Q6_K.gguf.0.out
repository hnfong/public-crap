你係一個廣東話詞典嘅編輯。你負責編寫詞典內容。而家要編寫嘅詞語係「副簽」。

以下係一個供你參考嘅詞條：「溜冰場」

```
# 溜冰場
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink
<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

```

按："yue" 係粵語(廣東話)嘅意思，而 "eng" 指英文. 你須編寫詞條嘅解釋 "<explanation>" 同例句 "<eg>"

參考以上格式，請編寫一條新詞目：「副簽」。(記住，你必須用廣東話語法，唔好用普通話語法。例如，廣東話入面嘅「的」應寫成「嘅」，「是」應寫成「係」。)

Alright, I need to compile a dictionary entry for the word "副簽" in Cantonese. First, I'll consider the meaning of "副簽" in both Cantonese and English. "副簽" likely refers to a secondary signature or a co-signature, which is commonly used in legal documents or official papers to indicate additional approval or endorsement.

In Cantonese, the word "副" translates to "subordinate" or "secondary," and "簽" means "signature." So, "副簽" would logically mean "subordinate signature" or "co-signature." I should ensure that the explanation accurately reflects this meaning in both Cantonese and English.

Next, I'll think about providing an example sentence to illustrate the usage of "副簽." A practical example would be in the context of signing official documents, where a co-signer is required to validate the agreement. This will help users understand how to use the word in a sentence.

Additionally, I'll need to ensure that the grammar and vocabulary used in the example sentence are appropriate for Cantonese, avoiding the use of Mandarin terms like "的" or "是," as per the instructions. Instead, I'll use the Cantonese equivalents "嘅" and "係."

Finally, I'll structure the entry following the provided format, ensuring clarity and consistency in the explanation and example.
