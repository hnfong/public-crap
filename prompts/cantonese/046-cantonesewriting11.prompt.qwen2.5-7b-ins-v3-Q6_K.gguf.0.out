<Thought>
Alright, I need to create a new entry for the word "副簽" in the Cantonese dictionary following the provided format. First, I'll identify the part of speech. "副簽" likely refers to a secondary signature or a copy of a signature, so it should be categorized as a noun.

Next, I'll think about the explanation in Cantonese. "副簽" in Cantonese would mean "a secondary signature" or "a copy of a signature." I'll need to ensure that the explanation is clear and accurately reflects the meaning in both Cantonese and English.

For the example sentence, I'll need to construct a sentence that uses "副簽" in a natural way. Perhaps something like "他用副簽簽名。" which translates to "He used a copy signature to sign."

I should also consider any nuances in Cantonese grammar, such as the correct use of particles like "嘅" for possession or "係" for "is." Ensuring that the example sentence follows proper Cantonese syntax is important for clarity.

Additionally, I'll need to make sure that the English translation accurately captures the meaning of "副簽." "Copy signature" seems appropriate, but I might also consider "secondary signature" as an alternative.

Finally, I'll review the entire entry to ensure consistency in formatting and that all parts of the entry align with the provided examples.
