### Overview of the Situation
The speaker is an older individual (referred to as "阿叔") who has been working since the age of 13. He is observing the current job - seeking situation where many young and attractive job - seekers ("靚仔靚妹") are complaining about not being able to find jobs. The overall situation in the job market is that companies are using cash - in - hand salaries ("現金糧") to attract job applicants.

The problems these young job - seekers are facing are multi - faceted. Firstly, they lack the necessary qualifications. They have no work experience and no proper educational background. As a result, they are not in a position to demand or even be considered for jobs that offer cash - in - hand salaries. Secondly, they are picky about job conditions. They complain that jobs are hard, dirty, have no future prospects, and offer low pay.

### Reasons for the Problems
The young job - seekers' lack of experience and education puts them at a disadvantage in the competitive job market. There are many people looking for jobs, and companies have the luxury of being selective. Since these young people do not meet the basic requirements in terms of skills and knowledge, they are less likely to be hired. Moreover, their high expectations regarding job conditions make them less willing to accept available jobs, further exacerbating their employment difficulties.

### Evaluation of the Conclusion
I partially agree with the speaker's conclusion. It is true that some job - seekers may have unrealistic expectations and lack the necessary qualifications, which can contribute to the difficulty in filling job vacancies. However, it is an oversimplification to say that the problem lies entirely with the job - seekers.

There are also structural issues in the job market. For example, some companies may offer low - quality jobs with poor working conditions and low pay, which are not attractive even to those with limited options. Additionally, the education system may not be providing students with the skills and knowledge that are in demand in the current job market, leaving many young people unprepared for the workforce. So, while the job - seekers' shortcomings are a factor, they are not the sole cause of the "hiring difficulty" problem. 

### 概述情况（中文）
说话者是一位年纪较大的男士（被称为“阿叔”），他自13岁起就开始工作。他观察到当下很多年轻靓仔靓女抱怨找不到工作。目前就业市场的整体情况是，公司用现金薪水（“現金糧”）来吸引求职者。

这些年轻求职者面临的问题是多方面的。首先，他们缺乏必要的资质。没有工作经验，也没有良好的教育背景。因此，他们根本没有资格要求甚至被考虑给予现金薪水的工作。其次，他们对工作条件很挑剔。他们抱怨工作辛苦、肮脏、没有发展前景且工资低。

### 问题产生的原因
年轻求职者缺乏经验和教育，这使他们在竞争激烈的就业市场中处于劣势。找工作的人很多，公司有挑选的余地。由于这些年轻人不具备基本的技能和知识要求，他们被录用的可能性较小。此外，他们对工作条件的高期望使他们不太愿意接受现有的工作，进一步加剧了他们的就业困难。

### 对结论的评价
我部分同意说话者的结论。确实，一些求职者可能有不切实际的期望，并且缺乏必要的资质，这可能导致招聘职位难以填补。然而，说问题完全出在求职者身上过于简单化了。

就业市场也存在结构性问题。例如，一些公司可能提供的工作质量低，工作条件差且工资低，即使对选择有限的人来说也没有吸引力。此外，教育系统可能没有为学生提供当前就业市场所需的技能和知识，使许多年轻人对进入职场毫无准备。所以，虽然求职者的不足是一个因素，但并非“招聘难”问题的唯一原因。 [end of text]
