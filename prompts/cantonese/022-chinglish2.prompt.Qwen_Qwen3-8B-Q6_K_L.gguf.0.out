Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games.  
But I never gamble.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Oh, right... I never gamble on Big 2 either ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud?

**Bob:**  
He went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big 2.  
I said, "Let's play!"  
He said, "One cent for a card..." (because he plays really well).  
I said, "Okay, so what?"  
Besides, at most I would lose something like $10.  

**Alice:**  
Okay, you're crazy.  
:)  
Hehe. Let's go play.  
It's actually fun. But if you gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.  

**Bob:**  
But it's not very good to "stand so hard" (be too serious).  
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
No program.  
No.  
You can download it or something.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Well, you need to play online, or you need a program to play.  
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...

**Alice:**  
How about that?  
:)  
You're wrong.  
Hehe.
