Here’s the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha. Yeah, me two.  
I like to play very much gah.  
But I never gamble.  
:)  

**Bob:**  
Oh, right... I never gamble on Big2 either.  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe mud ah?  

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, "Come on, play!"  
He said, "One cent for a card..." (because he plays very good)  
I said, "So hang on..." Besides, I’d lose at most $10.  

**Alice:**  
Oh yeah.  
:)  
Hehe. Yeah, I guess that’s good. But if you don’t gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game thoroughly.  

**Bob:**  
But it’s not very good to "stand so hard" for...  
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it’s very stressful...  
Also, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
Meh, program.  
Moe.  
Hai, ng hai, yiu download or sth.  
:)  

**Bob:**  
Gum, play online because you need a program to play.  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

**Alice:**  
How are you?  
:)  
Ngi goi sai.  
Hehe.
