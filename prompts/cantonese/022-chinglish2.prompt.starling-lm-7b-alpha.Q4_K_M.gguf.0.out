Alice: Hah, I like to play games a lot, but I never gamble. 

Bob: I don't gamble on Big2 either, except for that one time a few weeks ago. 

Alice: A few weeks ago, Joe? 

Bob: We went to a friend's house, and he wanted to play Big2. I agreed to play, but he said it would cost 1 cent per card. I thought that was too expensive, especially since I might lose up to $10. 

Alice: It's not a bad idea, but if you have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much. 

Bob: It's not a good idea to be so stubborn about it, though. Gambling can be stressful. By the way, do you have the program to play online? 

Alice: I don't know what program you're talking about. You should download it. 

Bob: In order to play online, you need a program. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me through FTP or HTTP. 

Alice: Hmm, I understand.
