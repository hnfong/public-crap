Based on the information provided in the comment, there are several points that raise questions about the reliability of the story:

1. **Shadowing**: The comment mentions that the person shadowed the commenter for the first week of their new job. Shadowing is a common practice in the police force to observe and learn from experienced officers. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person will be accepted into the police force. The fact that the person was shadowing the commenter suggests they were interested in the police profession, but it doesn't guarantee their acceptance.

2. **Being fired**: The comment states that the person was fired due to "衰穿櫃桶底" (which I believe is a colloquial term meaning "dropping the cash drawer"). This is a serious offense in the banking industry, and it could indeed result in termination. However, the comment doesn't provide enough context to determine if this was the sole reason for their firing or if there were other factors involved.

3. **Threat of reporting**: The commenter mentions that a senior person threatened to report the person to the police if they didn't leave the bank immediately. This is a significant threat and could indicate a serious situation. However, the comment doesn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding this threat.

4. **Immediate acceptance into the police force**: The comment suggests that the person was immediately accepted into the police force after leaving the bank. This is highly unusual and raises questions about the vetting process. Typically, individuals who have been fired from a bank due to such serious offenses would not be accepted into the police force without a thorough vetting process.

5. **Personal character issues**: The comment mentions that the person has "個人品有啲問題" (personal character issues), which is a vague statement. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the nature of these issues and how they relate to the person's suitability for the police force.

In summary, while the comment provides some context about the person's background and the circumstances surrounding their employment at the bank, it lacks sufficient details to verify the story. The rapid acceptance into the police force and the mention of personal character issues without further explanation raise significant doubts about the reliability of the story. It would be prudent to seek additional information or verify the details with other sources before accepting this account as entirely accurate. [end of text]
