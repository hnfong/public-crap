Okay, let's tackle this translation request. The user wants me to translate a conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English. First, I need to understand the original text. It looks like they're using a mix of English and Singlish (Singaporean English), with some slang and colloquial terms.

Starting with Alice's first message: "hah. yeh. me 2. I like to play very much gah. but never gamble lor :)" 

Hmm, "me 2" is probably "me too". "gah" and "lor" are Singlish particles. So "I like to play very much gah" might translate to "I really like playing, you know." And "but never gamble lor" would be "but I never gamble, okay?"

Next, Bob says: "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" except for that time a few weeks ago"

"orr" is likely "oh right" or "oh yeah". Big2 is a card game, so "I never gamble on Big Two either, except for that time a few weeks ago."

Alice: "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?"

"joe mud" might be a typo or slang. Maybe "Joe mud" is "jialat" or something else? Wait, "joe mud" could be "what happened" but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "Joe mud" as in a name? Wait, maybe it's Singlish for "what's up" or "what happened". Alternatively, "joe" could be "what" and "mud" could be a typo. Maybe "a few weeks ago, what happened ah?"

Bob's response: "went to a friends house he wanted to play big2 wor gum i say play lor gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good) gum I fai si "so hing" la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..."

Breaking this down: "Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, right? So I said play, okay? Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays very well). Then I thought 'so cheap', right? Besides, at most lose something like $10, right?"

"wor", "gum", "lor", "jeh" are all Singlish particles. "fai si" might be "thought" or "figured". "so hing" could be "so cheap" (since "heng" in Hokkien means cheap, but maybe "so cheap").

Alice: "gum yau hai :) hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor"

"gum yau hai" might be "it's okay" or "it's fine". The Chinese part "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" translates to "it's good actually". Then "but if I really have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly, okay?"

Bob: "but it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga... yea if need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do u have the program?"

"stand so hard" might be an idiom. Maybe "take it too seriously" or "be too strict". So "but it's not good to take it too seriously, you know... Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful... By the way, do you have the program?"

Alice: "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth :)"

"meh program" could be "no program". "moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth" might be "I don't have to download anything" or "maybe I need to download something".

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..."

"So to play online, of course you need a program to play, right? My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait..."

Alice: "hoe ark. :) ng goi sai hehe"

"hoe ark" might be "okay" or "alright". "ng goi sai" could be "I'll try" or "I'll see".

Now, translating all this into simple English, keeping the casual tone but making it understandable. Need to replace Singlish terms with standard English equivalents, keep the meaning, and maintain the conversational flow.

Check for any specific terms: Big2 is a card game, so keep that as Big Two. "1 cent for a card" makes sense. "so hing" as "so cheap". "stand so hard" as "take it too seriously".

Also, note the use of "gum" which is "then" in Singlish. So "gum I say play lor" becomes "so I said play, okay?"

Make sure the translation is simple and clear, avoiding slang that's too specific. Replace Singlish particles with standard English equivalents like "you know", "right?", "okay".

Let me piece it together step by step.

Alice:
hah.
yeh. me 2.
I like to play very much gah.
but never gamble lor
:)

Translation:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like playing, you know.
But I never gamble, okay? :)

Bob:
orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)
except for that time a few weeks ago

Translation:
Oh right... I never gamble on Big Two either. ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice:
a few weeks ago joe mud ah?

Translation:
What happened a few weeks ago? Ah?

Bob:
went to a friends house
he wanted to play big2 wor
gum i say play lor
gum he said 1 cent for a card...  (coz he plays very good)
gum I fai si "so hing" la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh...

Translation:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two, right?
So I said, "Let's play," okay?
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays really well.)
Then I thought, "That's so cheap," right? Besides, I'd lose at most like $10, right?

Alice:
gum yau hai
:)
hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai
it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor

Translation:
It's okay. :)
Hehe. It's actually good. But if I really have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly, okay?

Bob:
but it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...
yea if need to gamble it's very stressful...
btw, do u have the program? 

Translation:
But it's not good to "take it too seriously," you know...
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

Alice:
meh program.
moe
hai ng hai yiu download or sth
:)

Translation:
No program.
Maybe
I don't need to download anything.
:)

Bob:
gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la...
my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

Translation:
So to play online, you obviously need a program to play, right?
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... Wait...

Alice:
hoe ark.
:)
ng goi sai
hehe

Translation:
Okay.
:)
I'll try.
Hehe

Wait, "ng goi sai" might be "I'll go try" or "I'll see". So "I'll try." or "I'll check."

Let me check if all parts are translated correctly. For example, "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" is written as "it's good actually" in the original, so the translation includes that. The Chinese part is already translated in the original, so maybe it's a mix. The user provided the Chinese translation in the text, so perhaps "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" is meant to be translated as "it's good actually", which is already there.

Another point: "ngor juun hai yiu gamble" translates to "if I really have to gamble".

"moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth" -> "maybe I don't need to download anything".

"ng goi sai" -> "I'll try" (from Hokkien "goi" meaning to try).

I think this covers most of it. Now, compiling the final translation with simple English, keeping the conversational tone.
