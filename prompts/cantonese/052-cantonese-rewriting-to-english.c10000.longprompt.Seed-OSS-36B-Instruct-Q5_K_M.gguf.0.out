Got it, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to rewrite the essay into English, but the user said "No need to translate any individual words or phrases." Wait, maybe that means keep the meaning but not just literal translation? Or maybe they mean don't translate proper nouns or terms directly? Wait, looking at the original, there are hashtags like #余英時, #王偉雄, which are names, so probably keep those as they are, or transliterate? Wait, the user said "No need to translate any individual words or phrases," so maybe just convey the meaning naturally in English, not word-for-word.

First, let's parse the original essay. The author starts by saying they saw someone mourning Yu Ying-shih three hours after work, only knew he was Wang Wei-xiong's idol, then Googled him and realized why he's famous. Then compares him to their respected teacher Yun Gen, both "erudite" and "identifying with Chinese culture." Then talks about Confucianism: in ancient China, Confucian disciples adapted to rulers, now in America, Confucian scholars (like Yu) would have to adapt to democracy, even say Confucius supported democracy, because otherwise they'd fail. Criticizes that Confucian tradition was shattered by May Fourth, so modern scholars just twist it to fit Western academia, using authority to claim Confucius is a democrat, ignoring real conflicts (like in Taiwan, Japan, UK—author says those are "Confucian" with hierarchies, so democracy there isn't really Confucian).

Now, rewriting into English: need to keep the flow, the personal tone (starting with "Three hours ago, after getting off work..."), the comparisons, the sarcasm but just convey the content. Let's start:

"Three hours ago, after getting off work and going online, I saw someone mourning #Yu Ying-shih. At that time, I only knew he was the idol of the famous blogger Professor #Wang Wei-xiong; besides that, I knew nothing about his life.

But in the 21st century, you don’t have to ask teachers all the time—with Google, you can know everything. After searching around, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wang kept mentioning Mr. Yu...

Mr. Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! Isn’t that impressive? Just mentioning that is enough to shock people!

I was like a stalker, constantly digging up Mr. Yu’s background: what does the Chinese Wikipedia say about him? What does the English Wikipedia say? How were people praising him when he won awards? And how are the obituaries talking about him now? A person I respect the most came to mind—Teacher Yun Gen. They’re really similar!

It’s a pity that Teacher Gen didn’t have a Harvard professorship, but their "erudite in both ancient and modern times" and "I am China" traditional Chinese skills are definitely from the same mold. Teacher Gen liked Taoism and Buddhism; Mr. Yu seems to be a Confucian fan.

But that’s a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, faithfulness, respect for hierarchy, and the proper relationship between ruler and subject. But if you studied at a top American university, got a PhD right when hippies were most prevalent, could you really go around teaching people to "respect teachers and value education" and not engage in so much "individualism"? That would be a disaster.

Speaking of how scholars avoid disaster, that’s the wisdom Confucius spent his entire life gaining. Confucian disciples couldn’t possibly not know: in Confucius’ time, chaos was about to sweep the country; he traveled around the states, hoping to get an official position to achieve great things. But he only knew how to recite the Zhou rituals and didn’t know how to cater to the bosses’ needs, so he returned in vain. However, failure is the mother of success—his students made more progress. Sima Qian said: "The seventy disciples scattered and traveled to the states; the greater ones became teachers, mentors, or high officials; the smaller ones befriended and taught scholar-officials." Why?

Because after several generations of transmission, they started to read the rulers’ expressions. By Mencius’ time, his interactions with kings were different—he chatted and flattered: "King Qi, you couldn’t bear to kill a cow; you must be a benevolent ruler! Pursue the Way of Kingship—you can do it!"

By the end of the Warring States period, "Confucian" strategists had mastered the game of "interviewing kings." To become officials, they discarded "benevolence" and "propriety" and all went to study "legalism," this new "technology." So Xunzi, a Confucian disciple, taught students who became high officials in the Qin Dynasty—you definitely can’t smell any trace of Confucius in Li Si.

Today, the United Nations has over a hundred countries; the situation is more complex than the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leave China, this "ancient land of etiquette," and go to the "barbaric" military hegemon America—could they really take out the Analects and tell people to "mourn parents for three years"? Everyone knows how badly Confucius and his students were rejected back then. So in America, Confucian disciples would definitely say that Confucius supported #democracy—"democracy is great," "the Communist Party is damned and destroys families"—only then can you be an Ivy League professor!

Maybe someone will ask: Isn’t nonsense without consequences? Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago; the Confucian tradition was shattered by the #May Fourth Movement. As an academic authority at a top university in the only post-WWII superpower, even if Johnny Kung taught people to take drugs and sleep around, someone might believe it—after all, America’s "theoretical nuclear bombs" are reliable; the consequences of Japan not believing in them are still fresh in everyone’s memory.

So why could Mr. Yu casually translate a few lines from the Han Shu into English and get a PhD, and then be invited to be a professor at several universities? #You know. They push you up to be an authority so you can firmly say: "All of you here are ducks—do you think Confucian thought is feudal? What a big misunderstanding! Actually, he was the first democrat! If you don’t have a Harvard professorship, just listen quietly!"

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy—frankly, those "Sinologists" know nothing. You say: The Republic of China is an example. Hey, buddy, is Taiwan’s political system "Confucian"? The Kuomintang bastards curse Tsai Ing-wen every day—is that how Confucianism is practiced? Did Tsai Ing-wen pretend to worship heaven and sacrifice to the earth? No, of course not. Scientific spirit, not being a charlatan—that violates Confucian principles. Do you think using Chinese characters means Confucianism? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, Britain is Confucian (at least among advanced countries, they’re the most Confucian): kings emphasize etiquette and pomp, power is granted by heaven, supreme and unchallengeable, everyone is in a hierarchy, no crossing ranks, so society is stable. As for the success or failure of their democratic systems, it’s not for a Chinese-American to criticize."

Now, the second part: comment on the essay, disregarding the sarcastic tone, what's the main point? Let's see. The author is talking about how Confucian scholars, when in Western (especially American) academic contexts, adapt Confucian thought to fit the dominant values (like democracy) to succeed, even if that means distorting the original teachings. They draw parallels from ancient China where Confucian disciples adapted to rulers to modern times where they adapt to Western academia. The main point is that Confucianism, as a traditional philosophy, is often recontextualized or distorted by scholars in foreign (especially American) academic spaces to align with local values (democracy, individualism) in order to gain acceptance and authority, rather than being practiced or interpreted in its original form. Also, critiques that this adaptation ignores the true nature of Confucianism, which emphasizes hierarchy and tradition, conflicting with Western democracy, but scholars twist it anyway for academic success.</seed:think>### Rewritten Essay  

Three hours ago, after getting off work and logging online, I saw someone mourning #Yu Ying-shih. At the time, I only knew he was the idol of the famous blogger Professor #Wang Wei-xiong—beyond that, I knew nothing about his life.  

But in the 21st century, you don’t need to ask teachers constantly; with Google, you can learn anything. After some searching, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wang often mentioned Mr. Yu…  

Mr. Yu taught at three Ivy League schools! How impressive is that? Just mentioning that alone is enough to astound people!  

I was like a stalker, digging into Yu Ying-shih’s background nonstop: What does the Chinese Wikipedia say about him? The English Wikipedia? How were people praising him when he won awards? How do today’s obituaries frame him? A person I respect most came to mind—Teacher Yun Gen. They’re so similar!  

It’s a shame Teacher Gen never held a Harvard professorship, but their “erudite in ancient and modern learning” and “I am China” brand of traditional Chinese scholarship are definitely cut from the same cloth. Teacher Gen loved Taoism and Buddhism; Mr. Yu seems to be a Confucian devotee.  

But that’s a problem.  

Confucianism preaches benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, faithfulness, hierarchical order, and the proper roles of ruler and subject. Yet if you studied at a top U.S. university, earned a PhD during the height of hippie culture, could you really go around teaching people to “respect teachers and value tradition” and reject “individualism”? That would be a disaster.  

Speaking of how scholars avoid disaster—that’s the wisdom Confucius spent his entire life honing. Confucian disciples could never ignore it: In Confucius’ era, chaos loomed; he traveled the states, hoping for an official post to achieve greatness. But he only knew how to recite Zhou Dynasty rituals and couldn’t cater to rulers’ needs, so he returned empty-handed. Still, failure breeds success—his students improved. Sima Qian wrote: “The seventy disciples scattered across the states; the prominent ones became teachers, mentors, or high officials; the lesser ones befriended and taught scholar-officials.” Why?  

Because after generations, they learned to read rulers’ moods. By Mencius’ time, his interactions with kings were smoother—he chatted and flattered: “King Qi, you couldn’t bear to kill a cow; you must be a benevolent ruler! Pursue the ‘Way of Kingship’—you’ll succeed!”  

By the end of the Warring States period, “Confucian” strategists had mastered the “royal interview” game. To secure office, they ditched “benevolence” and “propriety” to study “legalism”—this new “skill.” So Xunzi, a Confucian, taught students who became Qin Dynasty officials; in Li Si, you’d find no trace of Confucius.  

Today, the UN has over 100 countries—more complex than the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leave China, this “ancient land of etiquette,” for “barbaric” U.S. military hegemony—could they really pull out the *Analects* and demand “three years of mourning for parents”? Everyone knows how badly Confucius and his students were spurned then. So in America, Confucian disciples will surely claim Confucius supported #democracy—“democracy is great,” “the Communist Party is damned and destroys families”—only then can you become an Ivy League professor!  

Maybe someone asks: “Isn’t nonsense without consequences?” Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died 2,000 years ago; Confucian tradition was shattered by the #May Fourth Movement. As an academic authority at a top U.S. university—the only post-WWII superpower—even if Johnny Kung taught drug use or promiscuity, people might believe it. After all, America’s “theoretical nuclear bombs” are reliable; Japan’s mistake of ignoring them still haunts us.  

So why could Yu casually translate a few lines from *Hanshu* into English, earn a PhD, and get hired by multiple universities? #You know. They prop you up as an authority so you can declare: “You’re all fools—think Confucianism is feudal? What a misunderstanding! He was the first democrat! If you don’t have a Harvard post, just listen!”  

Does Confucianism conflict with democracy? Frankly, “Sinologists” know nothing. You say: “The Republic of China is an example.” Hey, is Taiwan’s system “Confucian”? KMT thugs curse Tsai Ing-wen daily—is that Confucian? Did Tsai pretend to worship heaven? No. Scientific spirit, not charlatanry—*that* violates Confucianism. Do Chinese characters equal Confucianism? Is Confucianism only Chinese?  

As I said: Japan is Confucian, Britain is Confucian (among advanced nations, they’re the most “Confucian”): Kings value etiquette and pomp, power from heaven is supreme and unchallenged, strict hierarchies keep society stable. Whether their democracy succeeds or fails? Not for a Chinese-American to judge.  


### Comment on the Essay: Main Point (Disregarding Sarcasm)  

The author’s core argument is that **traditional Confucian thought is often distorted or recontextualized by scholars in Western (especially American) academic spaces to align with dominant local values (e.g., democracy, individualism)**, rather than being interpreted in its original form.  

To support this, the author:  
1. **Draws parallels between ancient and modern adaptation**: In ancient China, Confucian disciples adapted their teachings to flatter rulers or pursue power (e.g., Mencius pandering to kings, Xunzi’s students embracing legalism). Today, Confucian scholars in America similarly “adapt” to Western academia by framing Confucianism as compatible with democracy—even claiming Confucius supported it—to gain status and acceptance.  
2. **Critiques academic opportunism**: The author argues that scholars like Yu Ying-shih succeed not because of rigorous Confucian scholarship, but by weaponizing Western academic authority to twist tradition. This distortion ignores Confucianism’s core emphasis on hierarchy, ritual, and tradition, which conflict with Western values like democracy.  
3. **Challenges superficial “Confucian” labels**: The author mocks the idea that using Chinese characters or vague “traditional” identities equates to genuine Confucianism. They note that countries like Japan or Britain—often mislabeled as “Confucian”—prioritize hierarchy and stability over democratic ideals, exposing the hypocrisy of Western scholars’ claims.  

In short, the author contends that Confucianism, when exported to Western academia, becomes a tool for academic and cultural capital rather than a meaningful philosophical tradition—its original teachings sacrificed to fit dominant Western narratives. [end of text]
