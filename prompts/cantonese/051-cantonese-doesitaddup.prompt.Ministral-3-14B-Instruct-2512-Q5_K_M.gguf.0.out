This comment is highly dubious and raises several red flags that make the story **unlikely to be credible**. Here’s why:

### **1. Inconsistencies in the Timeline & Context**
   - **Shadowing a New Employee for a Week**: The claim that the award-winning police officer (陳大文) was shadowed for a week before being fired seems odd. Typically, new hires are given a probationary period (often months), not just a week. If he was fired so quickly, it suggests either:
     - **Extreme incompetence** (e.g., failing basic tasks, insubordination, or a major breach).
     - **A fabricated story** to discredit him.
   - **"Wearing a trash can at the bottom of the wardrobe" (衰穿櫃桶底)**: This is a nonsensical phrase in Cantonese. Even if interpreted loosely (e.g., "wearing something inappropriate" or "dressing poorly"), it’s an absurd reason to fire someone—especially someone who later became an award-winning police officer. Police forces (and banks) have strict dress codes, but this phrasing is more likely **sarcastic or exaggerated** to make the story seem ridiculous.

### **2. The Threat of Legal Action & Immediate Firing**
   - The claim that the boss said, *"If you don’t leave today, I’ll report you to the police"* (話你唔即日走就報官) is **highly suspicious**.
     - **Why would a bank threaten to report a new employee to the police?** Unless he committed a serious crime (e.g., fraud, theft, or harassment), this is an **unprofessional and extreme** response. Most HR procedures involve warnings, performance reviews, or legal consultations—not direct police threats.
     - **If he was fired for a minor issue**, why would the bank involve the police? This suggests the story is **exaggerated or fabricated** to make the firing seem unjustified.
   - The fact that he was **"escorted out by security"** (同保安落嚟押住佢執野走) is also **dramatic and unlikely** for a routine firing. Most firings happen in private HR meetings, not with security involvement.

### **3. The Police Vetting (Vetting) Issue**
   - The comment claims: *"His personal character has some issues, I don’t know how he passed the vetting"* (佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關).
     - **Police vetting is extremely thorough** in Hong Kong (and most places). It includes:
       - **Background checks** (criminal record, financial history, past employment).
       - **Psychological evaluations**.
       - **Reference checks** (from previous employers).
     - If he was fired for something as trivial as "wearing a trash can," it **would not** appear in his records. The fact that he passed vetting suggests:
       - **The firing was for a different (more serious) reason** (e.g., fraud, misconduct, or a criminal offense).
       - **The commenter is lying or exaggerating** to discredit him.

### **4. Motivational Bias (Why Would Someone Say This?)**
   - The commenter claims to be a **former colleague** but provides **no verifiable details** (e.g., bank name, exact job roles, dates).
   - The tone is **bitter and vindictive**, suggesting:
     - **Personal grudge** (maybe he was also fired or had a bad experience).
     - **Attempt to discredit the officer** (possibly because he’s now successful).
     - **Trolling or humor** (the absurdity of the story makes it seem like a joke).
   - If this were true, **other former colleagues or the bank itself** would likely have more credible accounts. The lack of supporting evidence makes it **highly unreliable**.

### **5. Police Awards & Career Trajectory**
   - If this officer **really** had a major character flaw (e.g., fraud, violence, or unethical behavior), he **would not** have become an award-winning police officer.
   - Police forces **investigate thoroughly** before promoting officers. If he had a history of misconduct, it would likely be discovered during background checks for promotions or sensitive roles.

### **Possible Explanations for the Comment:**
1. **A Joke or Satire** – The absurdity of the story (trash can + immediate firing + police threat) makes it seem like a **darkly humorous exaggeration**.
2. **A Personal Vendetta** – The commenter may have a grudge and is trying to ruin the officer’s reputation.
3. **Misinterpretation or Misremembering** – Maybe the firing was for something serious (e.g., theft, harassment), but the commenter **misrepresented it** in an exaggerated way.
4. **Trolling or Forum Culture** – Some online forums encourage **outrageous or fake stories** for engagement.

### **Conclusion: Do I Buy the Story?**
**No, I do not believe this story as presented.**
- The reasoning for firing is **too trivial and absurd** for someone who later became an award-winning police officer.
- The **threat of police involvement** is **unrealistic** for a routine employment issue.
- The **lack of verifiable details** makes it **highly suspicious**.
- The **tone and phrasing** suggest either **exaggeration, a joke, or a deliberate attempt to discredit** the officer.

If this were true, **other credible sources** (former colleagues, HR records, or the bank itself) would likely have a more plausible explanation. As it stands, the story **reads like a mix of exaggeration and trolling**.
