Here are the translations of the Chinglish phrases into standard Cantonese characters:

1. **gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah**
   => 個度有個便條啦 (There is a note over there.)

2. **ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?**
   => 我唔識用繁體字架，用簡體得唔得？ (I don't know how to use Traditional Chinese characters, is it okay to use Simplified Chinese?)

3. **mud yeah lei ga?**
   => 咁樣啦？ (Like this? / Is that how it is?)

4. **but yuu yat chai yum cha lah**
   => 不如一齊飲茶啦 (How about we have tea together?)

5. **gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu**
   => 個 Password 已經發去你個 Yahoo Email 啦 (The password has been sent to your Yahoo email.)

6. **farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga**
   => 返屋企瞓覺啦，幾時新風架 (Go home and sleep, when is the new wind? *Note: "新風" likely refers to "新風" as in "new breeze" or a specific context like "new release" or "new trend", but in this specific Chinglish context, it often implies "When is the new [something] coming out?" or "When is the new [event]?". However, a more common interpretation of "gei si sin fong" in 90s slang might be "幾時新風" meaning "When is the new [trend/release]?" or it could be a typo for "幾時新嘢" (When is the new stuff?). Given the context of "sleeping", it might be "幾時新風" as in "When will the new [season/thing] come?". Let's assume it means "When is the new [thing] coming out?" or simply "When is the new [event]?". A safer translation for the phrase structure is: 返屋企瞓覺啦，幾時新風架 (Go home and sleep, when is the new [thing] coming out?).*
   *Correction based on common 90s slang context:* "新風" is likely a typo or specific slang for "新嘢" (new stuff) or "新風" (new trend). However, looking at the phonetic "sin fong", it is very likely "新風" (new wind/breeze) used metaphorically, or perhaps "新嘢" (new thing). Let's stick to the literal phonetic translation which is common in these exercises: 返屋企瞓覺啦，幾時新風架。
   *Alternative interpretation:* "gei si sin fong" -> "幾時新風" might be "幾時新嘢" (When is the new stuff?). But without more context, we translate phonetically: 返屋企瞓覺啦，幾時新風架。

7. **yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok...**
   => 有錢啦，答得是返屋企... (I have money, the answer is to go home... *Note: "daap dik si" likely means "答得是" (the answer is) or "答得是" (it is answered). "farn hok" is "返屋企" (go home). So: 有錢啦，答得是返屋企... (I have money, the answer is to go home...)*

8. **kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung**
   => 個度 9 個 connect 8 個，但個一層呀個有 darp 大層 (There are 9 people connected to 8, but the one floor has a big floor? *Note: This is a very specific technical or gaming context. "darp dai yeung" likely means "大層" (big floor) or "大層" (big layer). "kui yat yeung" is "個一層" (the one floor). "kui jau" is "個有" (there is). So: 個度 9 個 connect 8 個，但個一層呀個有大層。*
   *Refined:* 個度 9 個 connect 8 個，但個一層呀個有大層。 (There are 9 connected to 8, but the one floor has a big floor.)

9. **need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju**
   => Need boot 幾，等我，我回遲咗 (Need boot [something] a bit, wait for me, I will be late. *Note: "boot" is likely "boot" as in "boot up" or "boot" as in "need a bit". "gei" is "幾" (a bit). "hoe hoi chi ju" is "回遲咗" (will be late). So: Need boot 幾，等我，我回遲咗。*
   *Refined:* Need boot 幾，等我，我回遲咗。 (Need a bit of boot, wait for me, I will be late.)

10. **yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai**
    => 壓實一實，唔敢隔住 (Press it tight, don't dare to separate. *Note: "yap sat" is "壓實" (press tight). "yim sat" is "一實" (one tight). "gum gan" is "唔敢" (don't dare). "gap zai" is "隔住" (separate). So: 壓實一實，唔敢隔住。*
    *Refined:* 壓實一實，唔敢隔住。 (Press it tight, don't dare to separate.)
