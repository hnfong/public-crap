I'm skeptical about the story. Here's why:

1. **Unlikely to remember a colleague from a year of shared work**: The author claims to have worked with 陳大文 (Chen) for a year, but it's unusual to remember a colleague's personal struggles and details from so long ago, especially if they weren't close friends.
2. **Sensational and dramatic details**: The story includes vivid, dramatic details like "衰穿櫃桶底" (failing to wear a tie properly) leading to being "炒" (fired), and "老細" (the boss) threatening to report him to the authorities. These details seem exaggerated or fabricated to make the story more interesting.
3. **Conveniently timed "shadowing"**: The author claims that Chen shadowed them for a week, which is an unusual arrangement, especially if Chen was already struggling with basic work expectations.
4. **Questionable vetting process**: The author implies that Chen's personal issues should have disqualified him from becoming a police officer, but the vetting process is designed to assess an individual's suitability for the role. It's unlikely that someone with significant personal problems would pass the vetting process without any issues.
5. **Motivation**: The author's tone seems more focused on discrediting Chen's achievement rather than sharing a genuine anecdote. This raises questions about their motivations and the story's authenticity.

Overall, while it's possible that the author did work with Chen, the story seems embellished or fabricated to tarnish Chen's reputation. I don't buy the story as presented. [end of text]
