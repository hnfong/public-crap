The comment tells a story about a former colleague, Chen Dawen, who recently received an award for being an outstanding policeman. The commenter, who worked with Chen in a foreign-owned bank for a year, shares an anecdote about Chen's first week on the job. According to the commenter, Chen made a significant mistake by selling a client's assets due to a clerical error (衰穿櫃桶底), which almost led to his immediate termination. However, instead of being fired, Chen chose to leave the bank and eventually joined the police force after going through the vetting process (vetting).

Do I buy the story?

Explanation:

1. **Plausibility**: The story is plausible because it is not uncommon for individuals to make career changes after experiencing failure or dissatisfaction in their previous job. The transition from a banking career to law enforcement is not unheard of, especially if the individual has a strong desire to serve the community in a different capacity.

2. **Emotional and Professional Growth**: The commenter suggests that Chen had "some personal issues" (個人品有啲問題), which could imply that the banking incident was a turning point for him. It is conceivable that this event prompted Chen to reevaluate his career path and seek a profession where his values and skills could be better aligned, such as law enforcement.

3. **Vetting Process**: The mention of Chen passing the vetting process (vetting個關) adds credibility to the story. The vetting process for law enforcement is rigorous and designed to uncover any issues that could disqualify a candidate. If Chen passed this process, it suggests that his past mistake was either not a disqualifying factor or that he had demonstrated significant personal growth and improvement since then.

4. **Lack of Specific Details**: The story lacks specific details about the nature of the mistake, the bank's response, and the vetting process. While this could be seen as a weakness, it could also be attributed to the casual nature of a forum comment, where people often share anecdotes without exhaustive detail.

5. **Human Element**: The story has a human element to it, showing that people can make mistakes and still redeem themselves. It is a narrative that resonates with many, as it reflects the possibility of second chances and personal transformation.

In conclusion, while the story lacks some specifics that could make it more verifiable, it is plausible and emotionally coherent. It reflects a common narrative of personal growth and career change, which makes it believable. However, without further evidence or corroboration, it remains a personal account that should be taken with a grain of salt. The story could be true, but it is also possible that it is exaggerated or embellished for dramatic effect, as is often the case with forum anecdotes. [end of text]
