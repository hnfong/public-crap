Okay, here are the translations of the Chinglish phrases into Cantonese, attempting to capture the intended meaning as a Hong Konger would have understood it in the 90s/early 2000s.  I'll also add some notes where the Chinglish is particularly ambiguous or relies on slang.

1.  **gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah**
    => 嗰度有冇咁煩睇囉呀？ (Go1 dou6 jau5 mou5 gam2 fan6 tai2 lo1 aa3?)
    *Meaning:* "Is it really that annoying to watch there?" (Referring to a TV show, movie, or something similar).  "Tai lo" is a common way to end a question in a casual, slightly exasperated tone.

2.  **ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?**
    => 我而家用廢紙㗎，用紙巾定紙？ (Ngo5 ji4 gaa1 jung6 faai3 zi2 gaa3, jung6 zi2 gan1 ding6 zi2?)
    *Meaning:* "I'm using toilet paper now, should I use tissue or paper?" (The "duck" is a mispronunciation of "ding" which means "or").

3.  **mud yeah lei ga?**
    => 乜嘢嚟㗎？ (Mat1 je5 lai4 gaa3?)
    *Meaning:* "What is this?" or "What's going on?"  "Mud yeah" is a phonetic rendering of "mat ye" (乜嘢), meaning "what thing."

4.  **but yuu yat chai yum cha lah**
    => 不如一齊飲茶啦 (Bat1 jyu4 jat1 cai4 jam2 caa4 laa1)
    *Meaning:* "Why don't we go for dim sum?" or "Let's go for dim sum together." "Yuu" is a phonetic rendering of "yu" (不如), meaning "rather not" or "why don't."

5.  **gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu**
    => 嗰啲 password send咗俾你個 Yahoo email 喇 (Go1 di1 password send6 zo2 bei2 nei5 go3 Yahoo email laa3)
    *Meaning:* "I've sent the password to your Yahoo email." "Jor hui" is a phonetic rendering of "zo bei" (咗俾), meaning "sent to."

6.  **farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga**
    => 返學好似身負重任㗎 (Faan1 hok6 hou2 ci5 san1 fu6 lor1, gei2 si1 san1 fung1 gaa3)
    *Meaning:* "Going to school feels like carrying a heavy responsibility." "Farn hok" is a phonetic rendering of "faan hok" (返學), meaning "going to school."

7.  **yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok...**
    => 有錢啦，答死係返學... (Jau5 cin4 laa1, daap3 sei2 hai6 faan1 hok6...)
    *Meaning:* "I have money now, so I have to go to school..." (Said sarcastically, implying they don't want to go). "Daap sik" is a phonetic rendering of "daap sei" (答死), meaning "definitely."

8.  **kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung**
    => 嗰度 9 唔 connect 8 嘅，慢鬼一兩吓，快啲嚟啦 (Go1 dou6 9 m4 connect 8 ge3, maan6 gwai2 jat1 loeng5 haa5, faai3 di1 lai4 laa1)
    *Meaning:* "It's not connecting properly, slow down a bit, hurry up!" (Referring to a slow internet connection). "Kui doe" is a phonetic rendering of "go dou" (嗰度), meaning "there."

9.  **need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju**
    => 呢啲 boot 嘅，等我，我好快嚟到 (Ni1 di1 boot ge3, dang2 ngo5, ngo5 hou2 faai3 lai4 dou2)
    *Meaning:* "This is a bootleg, wait for me, I'm coming soon." "Need boot" is a phonetic rendering of "ni boot" (呢 boot), meaning "this bootleg."

10. **yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai**
    => 壓死陰死咁咁咪 (Yap3 sei2 yam1 sei2 gam2 gam2 mai5)
    *Meaning:* "Pressing down on the dead, so dead." (A nonsensical phrase, likely used as a curse or to express extreme frustration). "Yap sat" is a phonetic rendering of "yap sei" (壓死), meaning "press to death."

**Important Notes:**

*   **Pronunciation:** Chinglish relies heavily on how Cantonese speakers *pronounce* English words, not necessarily how they're spelled.
*   **Slang:** Many of these phrases use slang that was common in the 90s Hong Kong youth culture.
*   **Context:** The meaning of some phrases is highly dependent on the context of the conversation.
*   **Ambiguity:** Chinglish is often deliberately ambiguous or nonsensical for comedic effect.
