<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "副簽" in Cantonese. We need to provide pos:名詞, explanation in Cantonese and English, and example sentence in Cantonese and English. Must use Cantonese grammar. "副簽" likely means "co-signer" or "secondary signature" in legal documents. In Cantonese, "副簽" might be "副簽字" or "副簽" meaning "co-signer" or "secondary signatory". Provide explanation: "係文件上簽字嘅第二位簽署人，通常係為咗擔保或證明文件有效性而簽署" etc. Provide English: "co-signer" or "secondary signatory".

Example: "佢係租約嘅副簽，負責擔保租客付款。" (He is the co-signer on the lease, responsible for guaranteeing the tenant's payment.) English: "He is the co-signer on the lease, responsible for guaranteeing the tenant's payment."

We need to ensure Cantonese uses correct grammar: "係" for "is", "嘅" for possessive, "負責" etc. Provide example with Cantonese romanization? The example in the sample uses romanization: "lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2." So we need to provide romanization for the example sentence. Provide both Cantonese and English. Provide explanation in Cantonese and English. Use the same format.

Let's produce:

# 副簽

(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:係文件上簽字嘅第二位簽署人，通常係為咗擔保或證明文件有效性而簽署。  
eng:the second signatory on a document, usually signing to guarantee or attest the validity of the document.

<eg>
yue:佢係租約嘅副簽，負責擔保租客付款。 (keoi5 hai6 zou1 joek3 ge3 fu6 sin2, fu6 zik1 daam1 bou2 zou1 haak3 fan6 fun2.)  
eng:He is the co-signer on the lease, responsible for guaranteeing the tenant's payment.

Check romanization: "keoi5" for 佢, "hai6" for 係, "zou1" for 租, "joek3" for 約, "ge3" for 嘅, "fu6" for 副, "sin2" for 簽, "fu6" again? Actually "副簽" is "fu6 sin2". "負責" is "fu6 zik1". "擔保" is "daam1 bou2". "租客" is "zou1 haak3". "付款" is "fan6 fun2". Good.

We need to ensure the romanization uses numbers for tones. Provide the example.

Also we might add "副簽" can also mean "secondary signature" in a contract. Provide explanation accordingly.
