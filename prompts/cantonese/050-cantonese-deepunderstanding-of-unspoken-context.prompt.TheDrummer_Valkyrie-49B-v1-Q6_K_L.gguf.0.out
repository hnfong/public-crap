Overview of the situation:
The person in this paragraph appears to be a young individual, likely in their early teens (as mentioned "13歲已經出嚟做嘢"), who has been working since a very young age. They seem to be reflecting on the current job market and the challenges faced by young people in finding employment. The overall situation is one of frustration and disillusionment with the job market, particularly with the emphasis on "現金糧" (cash incentives) by companies to attract job seekers.

The problem(s) the person has run into:
1. The job market is highly competitive, with many people vying for positions.
2. Companies prioritize offering cash incentives to attract employees, which the author believes is not a sustainable or meaningful way to secure a job.
3. The author feels that many young people lack the necessary qualifications, experience, or skills to be attractive candidates for jobs, despite their eagerness to work.

The author's conclusion:
The author concludes that the real issue lies not with the companies' offers but with the qualifications and preparedness of the job seekers themselves. They believe that if one's own conditions (qualifications, experience, etc.) are not up to par, they have no choice but to accept the available options, even if they are less desirable.

Critique and agreement with the conclusion:
While the author raises some valid points about the importance of self-improvement and the need for job seekers to be competitive, their conclusion oversimplifies the complexities of the job market and the challenges faced by young people. Factors such as systemic issues, lack of opportunities for education and skill development, and sometimes discriminatory hiring practices can also play significant roles.

Moreover, the author's assertion that they have "no problem" with undesirable job conditions at the age of 13 raises concerns about child labor and the potential for exploitation. It is generally recognized that children should not be expected to work in such conditions and should instead be in school.

In conclusion, while the author's perspective highlights the importance of personal responsibility and self-improvement, it fails to fully acknowledge the broader structural issues that contribute to the difficulties faced by young job seekers. A more nuanced approach that considers both individual and systemic factors would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. [end of text]
