I don’t buy the story, at least not in the way it’s being told.

1. Vetting for the Hong Kong Police Force is extremely thorough.  
   – It includes criminal-record checks, credit checks, interviews with former employers, neighbours and even secondary-school teachers, plus integrity and psychological tests.  
   – A “fired-for-theft” incident that ended with senior management threatening to “report to the police” would almost certainly have produced a police record or, at minimum, a documented internal-investigation file. Either of those would have shown up in the vetting process and disqualified the applicant outright.  
   – The idea that the same bank would simply let the person walk out at lunchtime without actually making the police report, yet still leave no discoverable trace for the Force’s vetting officers, is unlikely.

2. The narrative is too neat and dramatic.  
   – “衰穿櫃桶底” (caught red-handed stealing from the till) is a serious accusation, yet the teller claims the bank never followed through with the police report. That combination is rare: banks almost always prosecute teller theft because they need to deter others and to satisfy auditors.  
   – The timeline is compressed: fired in the afternoon, immediately “went to apply for the police,” then sailed through vetting. Real vetting takes months and would have surfaced the firing.

3. The post is anonymous and second-hand.  
   – The writer offers no corroborating detail (branch name, date, supervisor’s name, case number).  
   – It is posted on a forum where people often vent or settle scores; the tone (“佢個人品有啲問題”) sounds more like personal dislike than verifiable fact.

4. Internal contradiction.  
   – If the bank really had evidence of theft, it would have documented it. If it did not, then the claim that the person was “caught stealing” is unproven. Either way, the story as told is internally shaky.

So, while it’s possible the person was dismissed for some misconduct, the claim that he was caught stealing cash and still slipped through police vetting is highly implausible. Without corroboration, I treat it as unsubstantiated gossip rather than reliable information. [end of text]
