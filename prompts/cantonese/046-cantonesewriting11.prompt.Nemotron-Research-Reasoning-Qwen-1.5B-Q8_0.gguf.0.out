Alright, I need to create a Chinese explanation for the term "副簽" based on the given example. Let me start by understanding the structure they provided.

In the previous example, the word was "溜冰場". The explanation section had "yue" as the Chinese word meaning "the", followed by an explanation in Chinese and an example sentence in English.

So for "副簽", I need to follow a similar structure. The term "副簽" translates to "副签" in English. In Chinese, "副" is "副" or "副" (like "副" in "副签" meaning "副" as in "副" in "副" or "副" as in "副" in "副签" meaning "副" as in "副" in "副签").

But looking at the example, they used "yue" as the Chinese word for "the" in "溜冰場". So perhaps for "副签", I need to use "副" as the Chinese word.

Wait, let me think. The user mentioned that in the example, "yue" is the Chinese word, and "eng" is the English translation. So for "副簽", I need to structure it similarly.

So perhaps the structure would be:

# 副簽
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 司法签 (but not exactly, since "副签" is a term in legal context)
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几人。 (yue:副签场有几人。)
eng: There are several people at the legal sign field.

Wait, but "副签" in Chinese is a term used in legal contexts, referring to a type of sign. So perhaps the explanation should be in Chinese, using "yue" as the Chinese word, followed by an English translation.

So the explanation would be:

yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 在 law 的情况下，可能需要翻译成法语，但 since the user wants it in Chinese, perhaps just the English translation.

But the user provided an example where "溜冰場" had an explanation in Chinese and English. So perhaps for "副簽", I need to write:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签場 (the sign field)
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the sign field.

Wait, but the example had "溜冰場" followed by an example sentence. So perhaps for "副簽", it's a noun referring to a sign, so the explanation would be:

yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签 is a type of sign.

But to make it more precise, perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签 is a sign used in legal contexts.

But the user wants it in the same format as the example. So perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签 field.

But I think the user wants a concise explanation. So perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。

But considering the example used "溜冰場" with "有好多细蚊仔" and "有" followed by count noun. So for "副签", perhaps it's a noun referring to a sign, so:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。

But to fit the structure, perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签 field has several people. (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: The副签 field has several people.

But I think the user wants a simple explanation. So perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。

But considering the example used "溜冰場" followed by a sentence with "有" and "有好多细蚊仔", so for "副签", it would be "有几个人在副签处" or something.

So perhaps:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签 field.

So putting it all together:

# 副簽
(pos: 名词)
<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签 field.

Wait, but the user wants the explanation in the same format as the example. So perhaps:

# 副簽
(pos: 名词)
<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签 field.

But perhaps the "副签" is a noun, so the explanation should be:

<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签 field.

So combining it all, ensuring that the structure is correct.
</think>

# 副簽
(pos: 名词)
<explanation>
yue: 副签 (the副签)
eng: 副签是法律中的一个标志。
<eg>
yue: 副签場有几个人。 (yue: 副签场有几个人。)
eng: There are several people at the副签场.

Explanation provided in Chinese with appropriate usage of "yue" and "eng" as per the example. [end of text]
