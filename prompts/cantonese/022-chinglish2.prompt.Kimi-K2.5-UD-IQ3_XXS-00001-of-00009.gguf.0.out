Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play, you know.
But I never gamble, okay? :)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? What happened?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two, you know.
So I said okay, let's play.
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he's really good at it)
So I acted all confident... besides, I'd lose at most something like $10 only...

**Alice:**
So you still went ahead. :)
Hehe. You're quite something.
It's good actually. But if I really had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so stubborn, you know...
Yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program?
No.
Do I need to download it or something? :)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online of course you need a program...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

**Alice:**
Okay.
:)
Thanks
Hehe
