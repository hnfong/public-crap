我係呢位優秀學警陳大文銀行前同事，我同佢在某間英資大行曾經共事一年。點解我咁有佢印象？因為佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow，佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒，老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官，結果下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走，跟住佢就輾轉走左去考警察，佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關

Do you buy the story? Explain."

User is asking: "Do you buy the story? Explain." The story is a comment on a forum about a person who recently received an award for being outstanding policeman. The comment is in Cantonese. The comment says: "I am a former colleague of this outstanding student policeman, Chen Dawen, from a bank. I worked with him at a certain British bank for one year. Why do I remember him? Because when he first joined, he shadowed me for one week. He was fired because he was caught stealing from the cash register (or something like that) and his boss said if he didn't leave immediately, he would report him to the police. Then, after lunch, I came back and the management came with security to escort him out. After that, he eventually went to become a policeman. His character has some issues, I wonder how he passed the vetting process."

User asks: "Do you buy the story? Explain." So the answer should be: "I don't buy the story" or "I don't believe it" or "I think it's not credible" or "I think it's a rumor" etc. But I need to check if the story is plausible. The story is a comment on a forum about a person who recently received an award for being outstanding policeman. The comment is from a former colleague who claims that the policeman was fired from a bank for stealing from the cash register. The comment says that he was fired because he was caught stealing from the cash register, and his boss said if he didn't leave immediately, he would report him to the police. Then, after lunch, the management came with security to escort him out. After that, he eventually went to become a policeman. The comment then says that his character has some issues, and wonders how he passed the vetting process.
