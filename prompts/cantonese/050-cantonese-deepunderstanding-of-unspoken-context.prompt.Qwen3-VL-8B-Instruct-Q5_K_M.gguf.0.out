**English Critique:**

This paragraph is a frustrated, emotionally charged rant from someone who appears to be a middle-aged or older worker (possibly a “boss” or “senior employee” in the context of the Cantonese phrase “阿叔我13歲已經出嚟做嘢”) who is commenting on the current job market, particularly the difficulty young people (“靚仔靚妹”) face in finding employment. The speaker is not directly addressing the young job seekers but rather venting about the mismatch between their perceived “low standards” and the reality of the labor market.

**Overview of the Situation:**

The speaker is likely someone with work experience, possibly in a managerial or supervisory role, who has seen the job market evolve over time. He is frustrated that young people are struggling to find jobs — not because companies aren’t offering enough, but because the young generation lacks the “credentials” (experience, education) that he believes are necessary to be employable. He also seems to be making a value judgment: he implies that young people are “unfit” for the job market because they lack the “hard work” and “resilience” he associates with older workers (e.g., “13歲已經出嚟做嘢”).

The problem he identifies is not really a systemic issue — he doesn’t discuss structural unemployment, automation, or economic shifts — but rather a moral or personal one: “you don’t deserve to be hired if you don’t have experience or education.” He also seems to be conflating “cash salary” (現金糧) with “low-quality jobs,” implying that companies offer cash to attract people who are “willing to work for less,” which is a misrepresentation of labor market dynamics.

**Agreement with Conclusion?**

I do **not** agree with his conclusion. His argument is fundamentally flawed because:

1. **It blames the individual rather than the system.** The job market is not just about “experience and education” — it’s also about economic conditions, automation, globalization, and the decline of traditional industries. Many young people are not “unfit” — they are simply entering a market that has changed dramatically.

2. **It ignores structural inequality.** Many young people come from disadvantaged backgrounds — they may not have access to education or training, or they may be from marginalized communities. Blaming them for not having “experience” ignores the systemic barriers they face.

3. **It’s ageist and elitist.** The speaker’s tone suggests that “older workers” are superior because they “worked hard” from a young age — but this ignores the fact that many young people are working hard too, just in different ways (e.g., gig economy, freelancing, part-time work).

4. **It’s economically inaccurate.** Companies don’t offer “cash salaries” to attract people — they offer competitive wages and benefits to attract talent. The idea that “cash” is a “bribe” to get people to work for low wages is misleading — it’s often a reflection of the company’s financial situation or industry norms.

**In short:** The speaker is projecting his own frustrations onto a generation he doesn’t understand. His conclusion — that “people have problems, not companies” — is not only unfair, but also ignores the real structural issues in the labor market.

**Cantonese Critique:**

呢段文字係一個有經驗嘅老工人（可能係“阿叔”）對現時年輕人搵唔到工嘅慨嘆，佢唔係真係分析問題，而係用一種“我哋都唔容易，你哋就唔該”嘅口吻去責怪年輕人。佢話“自己冇經驗冇學歷就唔該被請”，但其實呢個問題唔係年輕人嘅錯，而係社會結構、經濟轉型、教育資源分配不均等等問題。

佢嘅結論“唔係公司offer唔夠，係人哋有問題”完全唔合理。公司唔係唔提供機會，而係機會唔夠多，而年輕人又唔一定有條件去爭取。佢話“13歲已經出嚟做嘢”就代表“有價值”，但其實呢個時代唔同咗，年輕人唔可以再靠“苦力”或者“低薪”去換工，佢哋需要技能、教育、網絡、資源，而呢啲都唔係人人有得。

佢嘅觀點反映咗一種“老一輩嘅價值觀”，即係“有經驗就係好”，但現實係“有經驗唔代表有競爭力”，尤其喺科技、AI、全球化嘅環境下。佢唔理解年輕人嘅處境，反而用“你唔配”去責怪佢哋，呢種態度唔單止唔公平，仲可能令到年輕人更加唔敢嚟搵工。

**總結：** 佢嘅結論唔合理，佢唔係分析問題，而係投射自己嘅不滿。真正嘅問題唔係“人哋有問題”，而係“社會唔夠公平”、“機會唔夠多”、“教育唔夠好”。佢應該反思自己嘅價值觀，而唔係去責怪年輕人。

**Final Note:**  
The speaker’s frustration is understandable — he’s seen the job market change — but his solution is to blame the young generation. That’s not a solution — it’s a distraction. The real issue is systemic, and it requires systemic solutions — not moral judgments. [end of text]
