Here's my critique of the paragraph:

**Objective situation:**
The writer appears to be a middle-aged man (referred to as "阿叔" or "uncle") who has been working since he was 13 years old. He is likely from a lower socio-economic background and has limited education and work experience. He is currently facing a situation where he sees many young people (referred to as "靚仔靚妹" or "good-looking boys and girls") complaining about not being able to find jobs, despite having better qualifications and conditions than he did when he was younger.

**Problem:**
The problem the writer has run into is that he is frustrated with the younger generation's expectations and sense of entitlement when it comes to job hunting. He feels that they are too picky and demanding, expecting high pay and good working conditions without having the necessary skills or experience to back it up.

**Conclusion:**
The writer concludes that the reason why companies are having trouble finding employees is not because they are not offering enough, but because the job seekers themselves have problems, such as lack of experience, education, and unrealistic expectations.

**Agreement:**
While I understand the writer's frustration, I don't entirely agree with his conclusion. The job market has changed significantly since he was 13 years old, and the expectations of younger generations are shaped by different societal and economic conditions. It's true that some young people may have unrealistic expectations, but it's also true that many companies are not offering competitive pay and benefits, and are instead relying on cheap labor to maximize profits.

Moreover, the writer's statement that "自身條件唔好就根本上冇選擇" (if you don't have good qualifications, you don't have a choice) is overly simplistic and dismissive of the structural barriers that many people face in the job market. It's not just a matter of individual merit or hard work; systemic issues such as discrimination, lack of access to education and training, and unequal distribution of resources also play a significant role.

Overall, while the writer's perspective is understandable, it's essential to consider the complexities of the issue and not blame the individual job seekers for the problems in the job market. [end of text]
