The user is asking me to evaluate a forum comment about a police officer who received an award. The comment is in Cantonese and describes the commenter's past relationship with the officer. I need to assess whether I "buy" the story - meaning, is it credible, plausible, and does it make sense?

Let me break down the key points:

1. **Context**: The comment is about a police officer who recently received an award for being outstanding. The commenter claims to be a former colleague from a time when they both worked at an English-funded bank (英資大行).

2. **The story**: The commenter says:
   - The officer shadowed them in their first week of work.
   - The officer was fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (which literally means "rotting through the bottom of the cabinet" - this is a colloquial Cantonese idiom meaning "to be caught stealing" or "to be caught red-handed" or "to be caught out").
   - The boss threatened to report them to the police (報官) if they didn't leave immediately.
   - The next day, the commenter came back from lunch and the security came to escort the officer out to pack up and leave.
   - The officer then went on to become a police officer.
   - The commenter claims the officer has "人品有啲問題" (some character issues) and questions how they passed the vetting process (vetting個關).

3. **Credibility concerns**:
   - **Anonymity**: The comment is anonymous. No verification of identity.
   - **Specificity**: The details are very specific (first week, shadowing, being fired, the exact phrase "衰穿櫃桶底", the boss's threat, the security escort, the transition to police work).
   - **Plausibility**: It's plausible that someone could be fired for theft in a bank and then become a police officer. However, the vetting process for police officers is typically very strict, especially for financial crimes or dishonesty. Passing vetting with a history of theft (even if dismissed) would be highly unlikely.
   - **Tone**: The tone is very negative and accusatory. The commenter seems to be trying to discredit the officer.
   - **"報官"**: The phrase "報官" (report to the police) is interesting. In Hong Kong, "報官" can mean reporting to the police, but it's also used in a more general sense of "reporting someone" or "telling on someone." The context here is that the boss is threatening to report the employee to the police for theft. This is plausible.
   - **"衰穿櫃桶底"**: This is a strong accusation. It's a common idiom for being caught stealing or being caught out. It's plausible that this happened.
   - **Vetting**: The claim that the officer "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" (doesn't know why they passed the vetting process) is a strong assertion. It implies the commenter believes the officer is unfit for duty. This is a serious claim and needs scrutiny.

4. **Logical consistency**:
   - If the officer was fired for theft, it's a serious black mark. For them to become a police officer, they would need to pass rigorous background checks, including financial history, character references, and criminal record checks. A history of theft would be a major red flag.
   - The commenter is providing a first-hand account. This adds weight, but also raises the question of why they are now revealing this information.

5. **Counterarguments/Alternative explanations**:
   - Could this be a case of mistaken identity? Unlikely, as the name "陳大文" is mentioned.
   - Could the commenter be lying or exaggerating? Possible, but the specificity suggests they believe it's true.
   - Could the officer have been reformed? Yes, but the vetting process is designed to prevent this.
   - Could the commenter have a grudge? The tone suggests a personal conflict.

6. **Conclusion**: The story is **plausible but highly suspect**. The specific details are consistent with a real event, but the claim that the officer passed vetting is a major red flag. In reality, a history of theft, even if dismissed, would almost certainly disqualify someone from becoming a police officer in Hong Kong. The vetting process is very thorough. Therefore, while the *events* described might have happened, the *conclusion* that the officer is unfit and somehow slipped through is likely an exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the vetting process. The commenter is trying to damage the officer's reputation, and the claim about vetting is the most problematic part.

**Final Assessment**: I do not "buy" the story as presented. The core claim that the officer passed vetting despite a history of theft is highly implausible and contradicts known facts about Hong Kong police recruitment. The commenter is likely telling a true story about the firing but is misrepresenting or misunderstanding the vetting outcome. It's a malicious or at least very biased account designed to discredit the officer.

I should explain this clearly, addressing the plausibility of the events and the specific claim about vetting. I should also be mindful of the language and cultural context.

I don't buy the story as presented, and here's why:

**1. The Vetting Claim is Highly Implausible:**
This is the biggest red flag. In Hong Kong, passing the rigorous police vetting process with a history of theft—especially being caught and fired for it—is extremely unlikely. The vetting includes:
*   **Financial disclosure:** Any history of financial misconduct, including theft, would be a major disqualifier.
*   **Criminal record checks:** Even a dismissed charge or internal disciplinary action for theft would be flagged.
*   **Character references:** A former employer's negative reference for theft would be devastating.
The commenter seems to fundamentally misunderstand or is misrepresenting how the vetting works. It's not a rubber stamp; it's a comprehensive background check designed to filter out exactly this kind of person.

**2. The Specificity vs. Credibility Paradox:**
The level of detail ("shadowed me," "衰穿櫃桶底," "報官," "保安落嚟押住佢執野走") makes the anecdote feel authentic, but it also makes the vetting claim more suspicious. If the events happened exactly as described, the commenter would know first-hand how serious the theft allegation was. They would also know that passing vetting was virtually impossible, making their final assertion ("唔知點解會過到vetting個關") either a deliberate lie or a profound misunderstanding of the process.

**3. The Motive and Tone:**
The comment is clearly intended to damage the officer's reputation. The language is accusatory and personal ("人品有啲問題"). This doesn't automatically mean the story is false, but it raises the question of why this information is being shared now, years later, and in such a public forum.

**Conclusion:**
The core events (being fired for theft) are plausible. However, the claim that this person then became a police officer and passed vetting is almost certainly false or a severe exaggeration. The commenter is likely telling a true story about the firing but is either misinformed about the vetting outcome or deliberately trying to discredit the officer by making a false claim about their suitability for the force. The story should be treated with extreme skepticism, particularly the vetting claim. [end of text]
