Hmm, the user has shared a forum comment in Cantonese about a police officer who recently received an award. The commenter claims to be a former colleague of this officer at a British bank, alleging that the officer was fired for stealing from the company ("穿櫃桶底" meaning embezzlement) and was escorted out by security. The commenter questions how someone with such alleged character issues passed police vetting.

This seems like a serious allegation that could damage someone's reputation. The commenter provides specific details - they worked together for a year, the officer shadowed them during the first week, and was fired after lunch on what sounds like their first week. The dramatic description of being escorted out by senior management and security adds emotional weight to the story.

But I notice several red flags. There's no verifiable evidence provided - no dates, no documents, no names of the bank or managers. The story relies entirely on anonymous personal recollection. The timing seems suspicious too - why would someone share this negative information only after the officer received an award? That timing suggests possible jealousy or malice.

The language used is quite emotional with phrases like "衰穿櫃桶底" (got caught stealing) and "押住佢執野走" (escorted while packing things), which feels deliberately inflammatory. The commenter also makes a judgment about character ("人品有啲問題") without providing concrete examples beyond the alleged theft.

Police vetting processes are typically rigorous, especially in places like Hong Kong where this seems to be set. They check employment history, criminal records, and conduct thorough background checks. If this firing actually happened, it should have appeared during vetting unless it was unsubstantiated or handled informally.

The user asks if I "buy the story" - meaning do I believe it? Given the lack of evidence, the anonymous nature, the emotional language, and the questionable timing, I'm skeptical. It reads more like character assassination than a credible report. Without proof, this could just be workplace gossip or a personal grudge.

I should respond carefully - acknowledging the allegations while emphasizing the need for evidence and due process. The police officer deserves fair treatment, and unverified claims shouldn't undermine their achievement. I'll explain why the story seems unreliable while staying neutral about the actual individuals involved.

Based solely on the information provided in this anonymous forum comment, **I do not find the story credible enough to accept it as fact without significant skepticism or further evidence.** Here's why:

1.  **Anonymous Source & Lack of Evidence:** The comment is posted anonymously on a forum. There is no way to verify the identity of the "former colleague," their actual relationship to the officer (陳大文), or whether they even worked at the same bank. No evidence (documents, witness names, specific dates beyond "first week") is provided to substantiate the serious claim of theft ("穿櫃桶底") and termination.
2.  **Inherent Bias and Motive:** The comment appears immediately *after* the officer received an award. The timing strongly suggests potential jealousy, resentment, a personal grudge, or an attempt to discredit the officer's achievement. The language used ("衰," "押住佢執野走," "人品有啲問題") is emotionally charged and disparaging.
3.  **Police Vetting Process:** Police vetting (背景審查) is typically rigorous, especially in jurisdictions like Hong Kong. It involves:
    *   Detailed employment history checks (including reasons for leaving previous jobs).
    *   Criminal record checks.
    *   Financial checks.
    *   References.
    *   Assessments of character and integrity.
    A documented termination for *theft* from a major financial institution ("英資大行") would be a massive red flag and highly unlikely to be overlooked during a thorough vetting process for a police officer. The comment offers no explanation for how such a serious incident could have been missed, beyond incredulity ("唔知點解會過到vetting個關").
4.  **Unverifiable Specifics:** Details like being shadowed for the first week, being fired on the spot after lunch, and escorted out by senior management and security are dramatic but unverifiable anecdotes. They could be exaggerated, fabricated, or misremembered.
5.  **Potential for Misrepresentation or Misunderstanding:** Even if the officer *was* fired from the bank, the *reason* given by the anonymous commenter might be inaccurate, exaggerated, or based on office gossip rather than formal findings. The termination could have been for performance, probation failure, or another reason misconstrued or maliciously reported as theft.

**Conclusion:**

While the story *could* theoretically be true, the combination of **anonymity, lack of evidence, highly charged language, suspicious timing, and the inherent unlikelihood of such a serious incident bypassing police vetting** makes it **highly dubious.** It reads much more like **unsubstantiated gossip, character assassination, or the airing of a personal grievance** than a reliable account of fact.

**Therefore, based solely on this comment, I do not "buy the story" as presented.** It should be treated with extreme caution and not taken as proof of any wrongdoing by the officer without independent, verifiable evidence. [end of text]
