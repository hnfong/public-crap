Okay, let's break down this forum comment and assess whether the story seems believable. Here's a translation and then an analysis:

**Translation:**

"I was a former colleague of this outstanding police officer, Chen Da Wen, at a bank. Why do I have such a strong impression of him? Because he shadowed me for his first week on the job. He was fired because he was caught stealing from the bottom of the counter (likely meaning skimming money). His boss even said if he didn't leave immediately, they would report him to the police. As a result, after I finished lunch that afternoon, I came back to find senior management and security escorting him out while he packed his belongings. He then went on to take the police entrance exam. His character is questionable; I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

**Do I buy the story?  It's *possible*, but highly suspicious and requires significant skepticism.** Here's a detailed explanation:

**Reasons to be Skeptical (Why it feels potentially fabricated or exaggerated):**

* **Severity of the Allegation & Award:** The accusation is *very* serious – theft/skimming from a bank.  Banks have incredibly robust security and auditing procedures.  Being caught doing this, and *then* being awarded as an "outstanding policeman" is a massive contradiction.  It's hard to believe someone with a confirmed history of theft would pass the rigorous background checks required to become a police officer, let alone be recognized for excellence.
* **Public Shaming Detail:** The detail about being escorted out by senior management *and* security, with a threat to call the police if he didn't leave, feels… dramatic. While it *could* happen, it's a very public and potentially legally risky way to handle a situation. Banks usually prefer quiet settlements and non-disclosure agreements to avoid bad publicity.  The level of public humiliation described seems almost designed to be remembered and shared.
* **Vetting Process Question:** The commenter explicitly points out the improbability of passing the "vetting" process (background check). This is a key point. Police vetting is *extremely* thorough.  A confirmed history of theft would almost certainly disqualify a candidate.  The commenter highlighting this suggests they find it particularly unbelievable.
* **Anonymity & Timing:** The comment is made anonymously on a forum *after* the award was given. This raises questions about the commenter's motives. Why come forward now? Is it genuine concern, or is there a personal grudge?  The timing suggests a possible attempt to discredit the officer.
* **"Shadowing" Detail:** The detail about Chen shadowing the commenter is a bit odd.  While new employees are often paired with experienced ones, shadowing for a *week* seems unusually long for a bank teller position. It feels like a detail added to establish the commenter's connection to the story, but it doesn't necessarily add credibility.

**Reasons Why It *Could* Be True (However Slim):**

* **Mistakes Happen:**  Vetting processes aren't foolproof.  It's *possible* that information was missed, or that the incident was downplayed during the application process. (Though highly unlikely for a confirmed theft).
* **Rehabilitation/Change:** People can change. It's *possible* Chen genuinely reformed after the incident and demonstrated exemplary behavior in the police force. However, the nature of the original offense makes this less plausible.
* **Different Interpretation of "Stealing":**  The phrase "穿櫃桶底" (stealing from the bottom of the counter) could *potentially* be interpreted as a minor infraction, though it's generally understood as skimming money.  Perhaps it was a misunderstanding, or a very small amount of money. (Still unlikely to be overlooked in vetting).



**Overall Assessment:**

I'm leaning towards **not believing the story as presented**, or at least believing it's heavily embellished. The core allegation of theft is so serious, and the subsequent award so contradictory, that it raises significant red flags. The dramatic details and anonymous nature of the comment further contribute to my skepticism.

**What would be needed to verify this?**

* **Independent Confirmation:**  Evidence from the bank (employment records, security footage, internal reports) would be needed to confirm the theft allegation.
* **Police Records:**  Checking police records to see if there was any report filed regarding the incident at the bank.
* **Vetting Records (Difficult to Obtain):** Access to the police vetting records (highly confidential) would be necessary to see what information was considered during the application process.
* **Response from Chen Da Wen:** A statement from the officer himself addressing the allegations.



In conclusion, while not impossible, this story feels highly suspect and should be treated with extreme caution until corroborated by independent evidence. It's a classic example of why you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet, especially anonymous forum posts.
