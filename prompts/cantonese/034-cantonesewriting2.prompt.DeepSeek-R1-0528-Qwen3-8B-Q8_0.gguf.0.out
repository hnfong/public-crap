嗯，用户要求我用广东话造10句包含"阴功"的例句，并附上英文翻译。用户特别强调要用广东话语法，比如用"嘅"代替"的"，用"係"代替"是"。

首先，我需要理解"阴功"这个词的意思。根据我的知识，"阴功"在广东话中通常指暗中帮助别人，不为人知的善行或帮助。它带有秘密、不张扬的意味，类似于"暗中帮助"或"背后支持"。

接下来，我应该考虑如何用广东话造句。广东话是一种方言，有其独特的语法和表达方式。我需要确保句子结构符合广东话的习惯，比如使用粤语的语气词、助词等。

然后，我需要为每个例句提供准确的英文翻译。这需要理解每个句子的意思，并用恰当的英文表达出来。例如，如果例句是关于暗中帮助朋友的，翻译时应该突出"secret help"或"behind-the-scenes support"。

我还需要确保句子多样化，覆盖不同的场景和用法，比如工作、家庭、社交等，这样用户才能全面理解"阴功"的用法。

最后，我要检查所有例句和翻译是否符合用户的要求，确保没有使用普通话的语法结构，比如"的"、"是"等，而是用广东话的表达方式。
