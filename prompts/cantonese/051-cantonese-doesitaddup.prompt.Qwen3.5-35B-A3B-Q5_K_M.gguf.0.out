I do not buy this story as a credible or factual account. There are several major logical inconsistencies, procedural impossibilities, and red flags that suggest this is likely a fabrication, a misunderstanding, or a malicious rumor.

Here is a breakdown of why the story does not hold up:

### 1. The "Vetting" Process Contradiction
The most critical flaw is the claim that the person passed the police vetting process (background check) despite being fired for theft ("衰穿櫃桶底" implies stealing or embezzlement) and being threatened with police action ("報官").
*   **Reality:** The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) vetting process is extremely rigorous. A criminal record, a dismissal for theft, or an active police investigation is an **automatic disqualification**.
*   **The Logic Gap:** If the former boss actually threatened to report him to the police, and the police were involved (as the comment claims security escorted him out), there would be a police record. If the police were *not* involved, the boss's threat was empty, but the dismissal for theft would still appear in a reference check or a background search. It is virtually impossible for someone fired for theft to pass the police vetting.

### 2. The "Shadowing" Timeline
The comment states the person "shadowed" the commenter during their **first week** of joining the bank.
*   **Reality:** In a major British bank (英資大行), the first week is usually dedicated to orientation, compliance training, and IT setup. "Shadowing" a specific colleague usually happens after probation or during a structured training program, not on day one.
*   **The Logic Gap:** If he was shadowing the commenter, he was already an employee. If he was fired a week later, the timeline is incredibly tight for a complex theft case to be discovered, investigated internally, and escalated to security escorting him out *and* the boss threatening legal action within 7 days, unless the theft was caught red-handed in a very specific way.

### 3. The "Security Escort" Scenario
The comment describes high-level management and security coming down to "hold him down" (押住佢) and make him pack his things immediately.
*   **Reality:** While banks do have security, the procedure for a suspected theft is usually:
    1.  Secure the evidence.
    2.  Call the police immediately.
    3.  Wait for the police to arrive to arrest the suspect.
*   **The Logic Gap:** Private security guards do not have the legal authority to "hold someone down" (assault/detain) in the manner described unless it is a citizen's arrest in progress, which is rare in a corporate setting. Usually, they would simply escort the person to a meeting room and wait for the police. The description sounds more like a dramatic movie scene than a corporate HR procedure.

### 4. The "Threat to Report" vs. "No Police Record"
The commenter says the boss said, "If you don't leave today, I will report you to the police."
*   **If the boss reported him:** There is a police record. He cannot join the police.
*   **If the boss did NOT report him:** Then the threat was a bluff. If it was a bluff, why did security come down? Why was he "held down"? If he was just fired for incompetence, the story of "stealing" and "police threat" is a fabrication by the commenter to discredit the award winner.

### 5. Motive and Tone
*   **Tone:** The language is highly emotional and personal ("我係...前同事", "點解我咁有佢印象").
*   **Motive:** This reads like a classic "character assassination" attempt. The commenter is trying to explain away the award winner's success by claiming he cheated the system.
*   **The "Vetting" Claim:** The commenter explicitly states, "I don't know how he passed the vetting." This is the biggest giveaway. If the commenter is a former colleague who knows the truth, they should know *why* he passed or failed. The fact that they are questioning the vetting process suggests they are trying to create doubt without providing concrete evidence (like a police report number or a specific theft incident).

### Conclusion
**The story is highly improbable.**

It is far more likely that:
1.  **The commenter is lying** to damage the reputation of the award-winning officer.
2.  **The commenter is mistaken** about the severity of the incident (e.g., maybe the person was fired for a minor policy violation, not theft, and the commenter is exaggerating).
3.  **The "theft" never happened**, and the "firing" was for a different reason, but the commenter is spreading a rumor.

**Why the Police Award Stands:**
The Police Force does not award "Outstanding Policeman" lightly. The vetting process for recruitment is the first filter. If someone had a record of theft or a police investigation, they would never have been recruited, let alone received an award. The existence of the award itself is strong evidence that the vetting process cleared him, making the forum comment's claim of "theft and police threat" logically inconsistent with the reality of his career.

**Verdict:** Do not believe the story. It contradicts the fundamental procedures of both banking and the police force. [end of text]
