### Overview of the Situation

The person in the paragraph appears to be an older individual who has been in the workforce for a significant period, possibly since the age of 13. The person is commenting on the current job market, particularly focusing on young people (referred to as "靚仔靚妹" or "youngsters") who are struggling to find employment. The person believes that these young people are facing difficulties because they lack experience, education, and do not meet the requirements for the jobs they are applying for. The person also suggests that companies are offering "現金糧" (cash wages) to attract applicants, implying that these jobs may not be desirable or prestigious.

### Problem(s) the Person is Addressing

1. **Job Market Challenges**: The person is concerned about the difficulties young people are facing in finding employment. They believe that these difficulties stem from the applicants' lack of experience and education.

2. **Perceived Issues with Job Offers**: The person suggests that companies are offering jobs that are undesirable or low-paying, possibly to attract applicants who are desperate for work.

3. **Criticism of Young People**: The person implies that young people are not suitable for the jobs available because they do not meet the necessary qualifications or are not willing to take on less desirable positions.

### Conclusion and Agreement

The person's conclusion is that the problem lies not with the companies or job offers, but with the applicants themselves. They believe that young people are not suitable for the jobs available because they lack the necessary experience and education, and that this is why companies are struggling to find suitable candidates.

### Agreement or Disagreement

**Agreement**: I agree with the person's observation that many young people may lack the experience and education required for certain jobs. This is a common issue in many job markets, where entry-level positions require more experience than what recent graduates or young people typically possess.

**Disagreement**: However, I disagree with the conclusion that the problem lies solely with the applicants. The job market is complex, and factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, and the specific needs of companies also play a significant role. Additionally, the person's perspective seems to overlook the systemic issues that contribute to the difficulties young people face in finding employment, such as the increasing competition for entry-level positions and the changing nature of work in the modern economy.

In summary, while the person's critique highlights a valid point about the challenges young people face in the job market, the conclusion that the problem lies solely with the applicants is too simplistic and does not fully account for broader economic and systemic factors. [end of text]
