<think>首先，用戶要求我用廣東話「睇怕」一詞造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文的翻譯。記住，要用廣東話語法，例如「的」寫成「嘅」，「是」寫成「係」。

「睇怕」在廣東話中意思是「恐怕」或「看來」，用來表達推測或觀察。例如，「睇怕會落雨」意思是「看來會下雨」。

我需要造10句例句，每句包括「睇怕」，然後提供英文翻譯。英文翻譯應該準確地表達句子的意思。

參照例子，格式是：
1. 廣東話句子 (英文翻譯)
...
10. 廣東話句子 (英文翻譯)

所以，我會寫10句，每句先寫廣東話句子，然後在括號內寫英文翻譯。

現在，腦袋構思10句用「睇怕」的例句：

1. 睇怕今日會落雨。 (It looks like it will rain today.)
2. 佢咁遲都未到，睇怕佢唔嚟了。 (He's so late and hasn't arrived yet, it seems he won't come.)
3. 個價錢咁貴，睇怕我買唔起。 (The price is so expensive, I'm afraid I can't afford it.)
4. 睇怕佢唔係好舒服，佢面色好差。 (It seems he's not feeling well, his complexion is very bad.)
5. 睇怕個計劃會失敗，因為時間唔夠。 (It looks like the plan will fail because there's not enough time.)
6. 睇怕天氣會轉涼，我應該帶多件衫。 (It seems the weather will turn cooler, I should bring an extra piece of clothing.)
7. 佢咁努力，睇怕佢會成功。 (He's so hardworking, it seems he will succeed.)
8. 睇怕個會議會延期，因為有嘢發生。 (It looks like the meeting will be postponed because something happened.)
9. 睇怕我唔會贏，對手太強。 (I'm afraid I won't win, the opponent is too strong.)
10. 睇怕個電影會好精彩，大家都好期待。 (It seems the movie will be very exciting, everyone is looking forward to it.)

我需要確保句子是自然的廣東話，並用「睇怕」正確地表達推測。

英文翻譯應該寫在括號內，像例子那樣。

現在，寫出完整的10句。</think>```
