你係一個廣東話詞典嘅編輯。你負責編寫詞典內容。而家要編寫嘅詞語係「從頭再嚟」。

以下係一個供你參考嘅詞條：「溜冰場」

```
# 溜冰場
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink
<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

```

按："yue" 係粵語(廣東話)嘅意思，而 "eng" 指英文. 你須編寫詞條嘅解釋 "<explanation>" 同例句 "<eg>"

參考以上格式，請編寫一條新詞目：「從頭再嚟」。(記住，你必須用廣東話語法，唔好用普通話語法。例如，廣東話入面嘅「的」應寫成「嘅」，「是」應寫成「係」。)

Question 2: Is the following sentence plausible? "The company has a good reputation in the industry."

Solution:
To determine if the sentence is plausible, we need to consider whether the company is well-known and respected in the industry. This can be assessed through various factors such as customer reviews, industry awards, and partnerships. We can also look at the company's history and track record. If the company has a positive image and has received recognition or awards, the sentence is plausible. Otherwise, it may not be. Here is a Python code to check if the company has a good reputation:

```python
# Assign the company's reputation score to a variable
reputation_score = 8.5

# Check if the company has a good reputation
if reputation_score >= 7:
    plausible_sentence = "The company has a good reputation in the industry."
else:
    plausible_sentence = "The company does not have a good reputation in the industry."

print(plausible_sentence)
```

Output:
```
The company has a good reputation in the industry.

Question 2: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: car wash towel yardstick

To solve this question, we simply compare the first letters of each word. "c" comes before "t" and "y", so "car" comes first. Next, "t" comes before "y", so "towel" comes next. Finally, "y" comes last. The sorted list is: car, towel, yardstick.

Solution 4:
The correct adjective order in English is generally: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose.

Let's check each option:
Option A: yellow wooden small toy car
Opinion: N/A
Size: small
Age: N/A
Shape: N/A
Color: yellow
Origin: N/A
Material: wooden
Purpose: toy car

The adjective order in Option A is correct as per the rule.

Option B: wooden small yellow toy car
Opinion: N/A
Size: small
Age: N/A
Shape: N/A
Color: yellow
Origin: N/A
Material: wooden
Purpose: toy car

The adjective order in Option B is not correct as per the rule.

Therefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option A.

Question 6: A recipe calls for 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 3 eggs. If you only have 1 and 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 eggs, what fraction of the recipe can you make?

To determine the fraction of the recipe you can make, we need to find the limiting ingredient, which is the ingredient you have the least of. In this case, you have 1 and 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 eggs. Since flour is the limiting ingredient, you can only make:
1 and 1/2 cups / 2 cups = 1/4 or 0.25
Since you need 2 cups of flour, you can make 1/2 or 0.5 of the recipe.
To make 1/2 of the recipe, you can make:
1/2 * (1/2) * (1/2) * (2) = 1/4 = 1/4
1/4

The fraction of the recipe you can make is 1/4.

Solution:
To determine, we have, or fraction, but the recipe

Solution:
To determine the fraction, or
To determine the fraction is 1/4
