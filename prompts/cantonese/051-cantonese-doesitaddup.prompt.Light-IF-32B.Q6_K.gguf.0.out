The story presented in the comment raises several red flags that make it highly questionable, and I would not "buy" it as a credible account of the person being an outstanding policeman. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

---

### 1. **Inconsistent Timeline and Motivation**  
   - The commenter claims to be a former colleague of Chen Dafan (陳大文) at a British bank, where they worked together for one year.  
   - The story says Chen was fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (a phrase that likely means he broke or damaged a cash drawer, possibly due to carelessness or theft).  
   - The bank manager threatened to report him to the police if he didn’t leave immediately, and he was escorted out by security.  
   - Then, the next step is that Chen "輾轉走左去考警察" (eventually went to join the police force).  

   **Problem**:  
   - Being fired for damaging a cash drawer (especially in a bank) is a serious offense. It would almost certainly involve a police report, a criminal record, or at least a black mark on his employment history.  
   - Joining the police force in Hong Kong (assuming this is about Hong Kong, given the Cantonese) requires a **rigorous vetting process** that includes background checks, interviews, and verification of past employment.  
   - If Chen had a criminal record or was fired under suspicious circumstances, he would almost certainly **fail the vetting process**.  

   **Conclusion**: The timeline and motivation don’t add up. It’s extremely unlikely that someone with such a background would be accepted into the police force, let alone be awarded as an "outstanding policeman."

### 2. **Lack of Evidence or Specifics**  
   - The comment is written in **Cantonese** and is very informal, which is fine, but it lacks **specific details** that would make the story credible:  
     - Name of the bank  
     - Date of employment  
     - Names of people involved (manager, security)  
     - Any documentation or proof of the incident  

   **Problem**:  
   - Without concrete evidence, the story is just an **anecdote** from an anonymous person.  
   - The commenter could be lying, exaggerating, or misremembering.  

   **Conclusion**: The lack of specificity makes it hard to verify the story.

---

### 3. **Tone and Intent**  
   - The tone of the comment is **skeptical** and **critical** of Chen’s character:  
     - “佢個人品有啲問題” (He has some character issues)  
     - “唔知點解會過到vetting個關” (Don’t know how he passed the vetting)  

   **Problem**:  
   - This suggests the commenter is trying to **undermine** Chen’s achievement.  
   - It’s possible the comment is a **personal attack** or a way to discredit someone who has succeeded.  

   **Conclusion**: The intent behind the comment is likely to **damage Chen’s reputation**, not to provide an objective account.

---

### 4. **Cultural and Institutional Context**  
   - In Hong Kong, the **Hong Kong Police Force** is known for its strict vetting process.  
   - Being fired from a bank for damaging a cash drawer would be a **major red flag** in the vetting process.  
   - The police force also values **integrity and trustworthiness**—qualities that would be compromised if Chen had such a background.  

   **Conclusion**: The story contradicts the known standards of the police force, making it even more unlikely to be true.

---

### Final Verdict:  
**No, I do not buy the story.**  

The story is inconsistent with the vetting process for joining the police, lacks concrete evidence, and appears to be motivated by a desire to undermine Chen’s achievement. It’s likely a **false or exaggerated account** from an anonymous person with a personal bias.

---

### Additional Note:  
If this were a real concern, the appropriate way to address it would be to:  
- Contact the police force’s vetting department with **documented evidence** of the alleged incident.  
- Not spread unverified claims on public forums, which can damage reputations and spread misinformation.
