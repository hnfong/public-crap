Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games.  
But I never gamble.  
:)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either. ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? What happened?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big Two.  
I said, "Let's play."  
He said, "1 cent per card..." (because he's really good).  
I thought, "Wow, that's intense!" But I figured, at most, I'd only lose around $10.

**Alice:**
Wow, that's something.  
:)  
Haha. You guys really went all out.  
It's good, actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully.

**Bob:**
But it's not good to "stand so hard" (resist so much).  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program?  
I don't.  
Do I need to download something?  
:)

**Bob:**
Of course, if you play online, you need a program to play.  
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... wait...

**Alice:**
How awkward.  
:)  
No worries.  
Haha.
