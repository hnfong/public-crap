**Overview of the Situation (in English):**

The person is a young job seeker in Hong Kong, likely aged around late teens to early 20s, who is struggling to find employment. He expresses frustration and resignation about the job market, particularly criticizing the trend of some companies offering **"cash allowance" (現金糧)** as a recruitment incentive. He seems to be someone with **limited work experience and possibly no formal qualifications**, which he acknowledges as a disadvantage. He questions why companies would use cash incentives to attract applicants when the candidates (like himself) don’t seem to match the requirements. He also draws a personal comparison to his own past — starting work at age 13 without complaint — suggesting that today’s youth are too picky or have unrealistic expectations. He concludes that the core issue is not the number of job offers or company shortcomings, but rather that **people themselves have problems** — implying that job seekers are at fault for not being good enough candidates.

**Key Problems Identified:**

1. **Lack of qualifications and experience** – He admits he has neither, making him a less attractive candidate.
2. **Job market challenges** – He observes that many young people can’t find work, and companies are using cash incentives to lure applicants.
3. **Misalignment between job seekers and job offers** – He questions why companies would offer cash incentives if the applicants don’t fit the job requirements.
4. **Resignation and blame-shifting** – He concludes that the root problem is the job seekers themselves, not the market or employers.

**Analysis of His Conclusion:**

He concludes:  
> “根本上都冇選擇… 自身條件唔好就根本上啲人有問題”  
Translation: “If your own qualifications are bad, then fundamentally the person is the problem.”

**Do I agree? Partially, but with important caveats.**

**Agree to some extent:**  
- It’s true that **employers look for candidates who meet basic criteria** — qualifications, skills, and experience. If someone lacks these, it’s harder to get hired, especially in a competitive market.
- His reflection on his own early work ethic — starting at 13 — highlights a generational shift in attitudes toward work, which may be relevant in some contexts.

**Disagree significantly:**
- **Structural issues are ignored**: The rise of "cash allowance" jobs often reflects a broader trend of **precarious employment** — low pay, unstable hours, and poor benefits. Companies use such incentives because they struggle to retain staff or because the jobs themselves are undesirable. Blaming job seekers ignores this.
- **Systemic barriers exist**: Many young people face unemployment not just due to lack of effort, but also due to **educational mismatch, economic downturns, automation, and discrimination** (e.g., preference for degree holders even for basic jobs).
- **Cash allowance jobs are often exploitative**: These are typically low-skill, high-turnover roles (e.g., delivery, retail, food service). Offering cash incentives may be a desperate move by employers to fill positions, not a sign that the market is fair or meritocratic.
- **His conclusion is overly deterministic**: Saying “if you’re not good enough, you’re the problem” ignores that **opportunity, access, and luck also play major roles**. Not everyone can start at 13, and not everyone has the same support systems.

**Final Verdict:**

His frustration is understandable, but his conclusion is **overly individualistic and dismissive of structural issues**. While personal improvement is important, the job market today is more complex than it was in the 1980s or 90s. Blaming job seekers entirely overlooks the reality of a **tight labor market, rising credentialism, and the gig economy’s impact on stability**. He may be projecting his own resilience onto others, but not everyone had the same starting point or support.

**情況總覽：**

呢位係一個單純嘅香港青年，估計年齡喺十八歲至二十歲左右，正處於搵工難嘅階段。佢對當前嘅就業市場表現出滿腔怨氣，尤其批評有公司用「現金糧」當成招聘手段。他自認自己既無經驗、亦無學歷，清楚知道自己處於劣勢，但又覺得好多公司用現金糧去吸人，卻又請唔到合適嘅人，覺得呢種做法好矛盾。佢仲比較自己13歲就出嚟做嘢，認為而家嘅年青人好嬲、好挑剔，對待遇同前景要求過高，最終得出個結論：根本上諗通就冇得選，唔好就怪自己唔夠好，唔係公司或工廠唔夠好，係人哋本身有問題。

**面對嘅問題：**

1. **缺乏資歷同經驗** – 佢自爆自己冇，影響競爭力。
2. **就業市場低迷同招聘手段變異** – 好多公司為咗搵人唔理手段，用現金糧吸引，求職者又唔配合。
3. **代際差異同工作態度轉變** – 佢以為自己早年搏命做嘢嘅精神應該人人都有，但當年嘅經濟同社會環境已經唔同。
4. **責任一邊倒** – 佢將失業歸咎於個人能力，忽略結構性問題。

**對佢結論嘅評論：**

佢話「自身條件唔好就根本上啲人有問題」，呢句有一定道理，但有啲過火。

✅ **同意嘅部分：**
- 當然，雇主都會睇基本條件，無經驗無學歷，搵工難啲，呢點唔出奇。
- 佢提到自己早年搏命工作，確實反映過去一代嘅工作態度，可能對比當年同而家青年嘅差異，有啲啟發。

❌ **唔同意嘅地方：**
- **結構性問題被忽視**：現金糧嘅流行，實際反映嘅係低薪、不穩定、唔吸引嘅工種。點解要用現金糧？因為工本身好差，唔好搵人。責任一味歸到人哋身上，忽略咗經濟環境同勞動市場嘅變化。
- **年輕人面對嘅障礙唔止能力**：好多時候係教育制度問題、經濟蕭條、機會少、甚至是種族/種種歧視，唔係努力就一定搵到工。
- **過度宿命論**：話「條件差就冇得選、只可以怪自己」，好容易令人覺得責任一邊倒，忽略咗運氣同機會嘅影響。
- **將個人經驗普世化**：佢13歲出嚟做嘢，可能有時勢背景（如經濟好、學校出路差），而家青年未必有呢個選擇。

**總結：**

佢嘅情緒可以理解，但結論過於簡化，將問題歸咎於個人，忽略咗社會結構同經濟環境嘅影響。個人努力重要，但當市場變差、工種變少、待遇變差時，責任唔可以只怪求職者。佢嘅經驗值得尊重，但唔可以將呢種經驗等同普
