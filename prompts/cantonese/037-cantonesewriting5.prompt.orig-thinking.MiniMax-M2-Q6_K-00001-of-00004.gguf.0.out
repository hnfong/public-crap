The user wants a response in Cantonese (廣東話) with the word "睇怕". They want 10 example sentences in Cantonese, each with an English translation. The user also gave a format example: they want to list the sentences numbered 1-10, each with the Cantonese sentence and then the English translation in parentheses (or after a dash). The user wants the sentences to be in Cantonese grammar, not Mandarin. So we need to produce 10 sentences using "睇怕". The sentences should be natural Cantonese. Also we need to ensure we use "嘅" instead of "的", "係" instead of "是", etc. Also we need to use "睇怕" correctly. "睇怕" is a phrase meaning "I think" or "I fear that" or "I suspect". It can be used as "I think that..." or "I am afraid that...". It can be used as a verb phrase meaning "to be afraid of looking at something" but more commonly it's used as a modal phrase meaning "I think" or "I suspect". For example: "睇怕佢會遲到" (I think he'll be late). "睇怕今日會落雨" (I think it will rain today). "睇怕佢唔會嚟" (I think he won't come). "睇怕佢哋會失敗" (I think they will fail). "睇怕佢哋會唔鍾意" (I think they won't like it). "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" (I think they won't come). "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is similar. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is a bit unnatural; maybe "睇怕佢哋唔會嚟". "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay. "睇怕佢哋會唔嚟" is okay.
