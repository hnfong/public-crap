I don't buy the story. Here's why:

1. **Unlikely to be fired for a single mistake**: While it's possible to be fired for a serious mistake, being let go solely for spilling something on a cabinet seems unlikely, especially in a large bank where such incidents are common. Most companies would address this with a warning rather than immediate termination.

2. **Threat of police involvement**: The claim that the supervisor threatened to call the police if the person didn't leave immediately also seems exaggerated. This would be an overreaction and potentially illegal, as it's not a criminal offense to make a mess at work.

3. **Immediate police escort**: The scenario of being escorted out by security and then immediately deciding to become a police officer is highly improbable. The process of becoming a police officer involves extensive background checks, vetting, and training, which takes months to years.

4. **Questionable vetting process**: The comment implies that the person's questionable character and past behavior would have been overlooked during the police vetting process. Police vetting is rigorous and would likely uncover such issues, making it unlikely for someone with these red flags to be hired.

5. **Motivation for sharing**: The person sharing this story seems to have a negative motive, possibly jealousy or resentment towards the award recipient. This bias undermines the credibility of the account.

In summary, while some elements of the story could be true, the exaggerations, implausibilities, and negative motivation make it largely unbelievable. It's likely a case of sour grapes rather than an accurate portrayal of events. [end of text]
