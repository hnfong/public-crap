 ## Alice:
Ha.
Yeah, me too.
I like to play a lot.
But I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, what happened?

## Bob:
Went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
So I said, let's play.
He said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well).
So I thought, "Why not?" Besides, at most I'd lose something like $10.

## Alice:
So you have.
:)
Hehe. You're quite daring.
It's good actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

## Bob:
But it's not very good to be so stubborn.
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
I don't have the program.
No.
Do I need to download it or something?
:)

## Bob:
Of course, to play online, you need to have a program.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... wait...

## Alice:
Okay.
:)
Thank you.
Hehe. [end of text]
