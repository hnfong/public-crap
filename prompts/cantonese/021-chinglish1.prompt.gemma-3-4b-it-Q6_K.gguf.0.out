**Important Notes:**

*   **Cantonese Variation:** Cantonese has many regional variations. These translations are based on a fairly standard form, but you might hear slight differences depending on where in Hong Kong or Guangdong someone is from.
*   **Context is Key:**  The best translation always depends on the specific context of the conversation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these translations, or perhaps provide alternative versions? [end of text]
