Alice:  
Haha. Yes, me too.  
I really enjoy playing, but I never gamble. :)  

Bob:  
Oh... I don't gamble on Big2 either. ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

Alice:  
A few weeks ago? You mean with Joe?  

Bob:  
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2, so I said, "Sure, let's play."  
Then he said, "One cent per card" (because he plays very well).  
I thought, "It's just a small bet." Besides, I could lose at most about $10.  

Alice:  
Oh, I see. :)  
Haha. You're right, it's actually fine.  
But if you're not willing to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.  

Bob:  
But it's not good to be too serious about it.  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it gets very stressful.  
By the way, do you have the game program?  

Alice:  
No, I don't have the program.  
I haven't downloaded it or anything. :)  

Bob:  
Of course, to play online, you need the program.  
My chat client can't send files yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

Alice:  
Okay, no problem. :)  
Don't worry about it.  
Haha. [end of text]
