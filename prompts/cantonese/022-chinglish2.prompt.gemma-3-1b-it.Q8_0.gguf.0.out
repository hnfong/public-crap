Okay, here's a simple translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob:

**Alice:** “Haha.”
“Yeah.”  I really like to play a lot.
“But I never gamble.”
:)

**Bob:** “Oh… I never gamble on the big games either, huh?  Except for a few weeks ago.”
“I think I should play!” he said. “I said 1 cent for a card – he’s really good at it!”
“I’m not sure I understand ‘so hing’ – it’s like, I lose a little bit like $10.”
“Yeah, I guess I’d probably not enjoy the game if I played a lot.”

**Alice:** “You’re right.”
:) “Hehe.”  I think it’s fun, actually. But if I gamble, I wouldn’t really enjoy it thoroughly.”

**Bob:** “But it’s not very good to ‘stand so hard’ – it’s really stressful!”
“If I need to gamble, it’s very stressful.”
“By the way, do you have the program?  I need a program to play.”

**Alice:** “Oh, no program.  I need to download something.”
:) “Okay.”
“Hehe.”

**Key changes made for clarity:**

*   Simplified sentence structure.
*   Used more common English phrases.
*   Clarified some of the more complex ideas (like "so hing").
*   Made the tone a bit more conversational. [end of text]
