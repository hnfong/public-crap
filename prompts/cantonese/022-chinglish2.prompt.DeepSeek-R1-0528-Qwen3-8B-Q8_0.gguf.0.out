Okay, let's tackle this translation request. The user wants a simple English version of a conversation between Alice and Bob that's clearly using some kind of coded or slang language. 

First, I notice the conversation has a playful, teasing tone with words like "gah" and "lor" that seem to be local slang or inside jokes. The user probably wants to preserve that lighthearted vibe in the translation while making it understandable to English speakers. 

Hmm, the dialogue also includes references to "Big2" which appears to be a card game, and mentions of Joe Mudah (likely a friend's name). There are some phrases that sound like they're from Chinese or another language, like "gum i say play lor" and "ng goi sai". 

I need to be careful with the translation because:
- Some words are clearly slang that don't have direct English equivalents
- There are mixed language elements that need to be handled
- The playful tone should come through in the translation
- References to specific people and games should be kept clear

The user might be trying to understand a conversation they overheard or received from someone using this coded language. They probably want to know what's being discussed without the slang. 

I'll start by identifying the most important elements:
- The game "Big2" is central
- Gambling is a sensitive topic they're discussing playfully
- There's a mention of an online program that needs to be transferred
- The tone is informal and friendly

For the slang parts, I'll use simple English alternatives that keep the playful meaning:
- "gah" could be "game" or "deal"
- "lor" might mean "lol" or "haha"
- "gum" could be "but" or "wait"
- "btw" is already understood in English

The mixed language parts need special attention. "Ng goi sai" sounds like a Chinese phrase - I think it means "I don't know" or "I'm confused". I'll translate that clearly.

I should maintain the emoji usage since that's part of the playful tone. The translations should sound natural in English conversation while preserving the original meaning and humor.

The user seems to be comfortable with informal language given how they phrased the request. I'll keep the translation casual but clear, avoiding overly complex phrasing.

## Alice:
Hah.  
Me too.  
I like to play games, but I never gamble.  
;)  

## Bob:
Oh, right. I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe Mudah?  

## Bob:
He went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
Wait, I say play.  
He said, “One cent for a card…” (because he plays really well).  
I thought, “So what?” Anyway, at most I’d lose something like $10, haha.  

## Alice:
Wait, you’re saying that?  
:)  
Hehe. I don’t really enjoy the game if I have to gamble, you know?  

## Bob:
But it’s not very fun to “play so hard” haha.  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s super stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:
Not the program.  
No.  
You can download it or something.  
:)  

## Bob:
So play online, right? You need the program to play.  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP? Wait…  

## Alice:
How?  
:)  
I don’t know.  
Hehe. [end of text]
