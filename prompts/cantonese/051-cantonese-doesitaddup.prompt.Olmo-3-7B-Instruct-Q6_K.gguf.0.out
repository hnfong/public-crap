Let’s break down the comment and the question, then explain whether I "buy" the story and why.

### **What the Comment Says**

The commenter claims to be a fellow colleague of "outstanding policeman"陳大文 (Chen Da-wen), who recently received an award. They state they worked with Chen at a UK bank (some "English bank"—likely a mistranslation or confusion, as police officers don't usually work at banks). They say they and Chen worked together for a year at a "British bank," which seems odd for a police officer.

The commenter then explains why they still remember Chen:

- **First week on the job:** Chen shadowed the commenter (probably to observe or learn).
- Chen was "rude" or unprofessional in his first few weeks (described as "comparing people to a steam kettle being boiled"—meaning he was harsh, abrupt, or not well-received).
- When the commenter warned him that he might get reported if he kept up this attitude, Chen didn't change.
- Instead, after lunch, the commenter went to higher management ("high level") and had Chen detained by security for his behavior.
- The security detained Chen while he was on duty, and the commenter just walked away to apply for the police (police officer) certification (likely meaning to re-apply for a police job or take a test).
- The commenter concludes that Chen has issues with personal conduct and doesn't know why he'd pass a vetting process (which is supposed to screen out unsuitable candidates).

The commenter ends by asking: "Do you buy the story?" and wants an explanation.

### **Do I "Buy" the Story? Explanation**

#### **Plausibility**

Yes, I can "buy" the story in the sense that it describes a real workplace dynamic that can happen, especially for someone new in a job who is adjusting to the environment. Here’s why it’s plausible:

1. **New Job Adjustment:** People often act out of insecurity or unfamiliarity when starting a new job. Being a new police officer, especially in a foreign country (given the mention of a British bank), could be stressful and lead to unprofessional behavior in the early weeks.
2. **Rude Behavior:** It's not uncommon for someone to be harsh or abrupt when under pressure or feeling out of their depth. Shadowing a colleague could be a way to learn, but if the new officer is impatient or critical, it could rub others the wrong way.
3. **Warning and Consequences:** If someone is warned repeatedly and continues problematic behavior, it's reasonable that management would take action—such as detaining the employee for conduct.
4. **Vetting Process:** The vetting process for police officers is thorough, and someone with clear personal conduct issues would likely be flagged. However, the commenter seems surprised that Chen passed it, which suggests either:
   - The vetting process was not as strict as it should have been (possible, but unlikely if done properly).
   - The comment is hyperbolic or exaggerating (a common feature in forum comments).
   - There's a misunderstanding about what the vetting process entails (maybe the commenter thinks it's less rigorous than it is).

#### **Issues in the Story (Less Plausible Aspects)**

1. **Working at a UK Bank as a Police Officer:** This is highly implausible unless it's a metaphor or a mistranslation. Police officers don't typically work at banks, so this part likely needs to be taken as hyperbole or a misunderstanding.
2. **"Shadowing" as Harassment:** While it's possible Chen was simply being supervised or shadowed, the way the comment describes it (with security detaining him, and the commenter's passive attitude) sounds more like they were reacting to poor behavior rather than normal onboarding.
3. **Exaggeration for Emphasis:** The dramatic retelling and use of metaphorical language (like "steam kettle") suggests the commenter is more focused on making a point than recounting a literal event.

#### **Conclusion: Is the Story True?**

It's unlikely the literal details (working at a UK bank) are true, but the underlying sentiment—that a new, possibly unprofessional police officer was warned, didn't improve, and faced consequences—could be based on real events, perhaps with some embellishment or misunderstanding.

**So, do I "buy" the story?**  
I can believe the *emotional truth* behind it: that someone new to the force, struggling with the transition, acted inappropriately and was eventually caught and disciplined. The specific job setting (bank) is probably not literal, but serves to highlight the officer's unprofessional conduct or immaturity in handling authority.

**Explanation:**  
The commenter is expressing frustration that despite Chen's supposed qualifications (being an "outstanding policeman"), he displayed poor behavior early in his career, which led to disciplinary action. The vetting process supposedly missed something, which the commenter finds hard to believe. The story is likely a mix of real workplace issues and dramatic storytelling, with some details probably exaggerated or confused (like the bank setting).

---

**In summary:**  
I can understand why the commenter is skeptical—they're pointing out a contradiction between Chen's award and his past conduct. The core of the story is believable as a cautionary tale about workplace behavior and the vetting process, even if some details are not realistic in context. [end of text]
