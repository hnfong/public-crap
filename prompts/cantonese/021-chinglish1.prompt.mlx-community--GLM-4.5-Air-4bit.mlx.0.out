### Notes:
- Some phrases are highly colloquial and context-dependent. The translations above are based on common Cantonese usage.
- "Chinglish" often mixes English words directly into Cantonese sentences (e.g., "connect," "password"). These are kept as-is in the translation unless a Cantonese equivalent exists.
- Tonal and phonetic approximations (e.g., "yau" for 有, "jor" for 咗) are normalized in the translation.
- For phrases like #8, the context is unclear (possibly about dial-up internet or a phone call), so the translation is a best guess.

### Key Notes:
- **Phonetic Approximations**: Chinglish often uses English-like spelling for Cantonese sounds (e.g., "yau" for 有, "jor" for 咗). These are normalized in the translation.
- **Code-Mixing**: English words like "password," "connect," and "email" are retained as loanwords since they lack direct Cantonese equivalents.
- **Context**: Some phrases (e.g., #8) are ambiguous; translations assume common tech/daily life contexts.
- **Tones**: Cantonese is tonal, so romanization (Jyutping) includes tone numbers (e.g., hai5, jau5) for accuracy.
