I'll critique the paragraph and provide an overview of the situation.

**Overview of the situation:**

The person is a young adult, likely in their late teens or early twenties, who is struggling to find a job. He is frustrated that companies are not hiring him, and he attributes this to the fact that he lacks experience and education. He feels that companies are only offering low wages and poor working conditions, and that he is at a disadvantage in the job market due to his limited qualifications.

**Problem(s) he has run into:**

The person is facing a classic problem of unemployment, which is a common issue in many societies. He is struggling to find a job, and he believes that the problem lies not with the companies, but with the fact that he lacks the necessary qualifications and experience to be competitive in the job market.

**Why he has run into this problem:**

The person's lack of experience and education is a significant barrier to employment. In many industries, employers require a certain level of education and experience as a minimum qualification for a job. Without these qualifications, the person is at a disadvantage in the job market.

**Agreement with his conclusion:**

I agree with the person's conclusion that the problem lies not with the companies, but with the fact that he lacks the necessary qualifications and experience. However, I would like to add that the situation is more complex than that. While it is true that companies may be looking for candidates with certain qualifications and experience, it is also true that many companies are willing to train and develop employees with potential. Additionally, there are many jobs that do not require a high level of education or experience, and the person may be able to find work in these areas.

In Cantonese, I would say:

呢個年青仔係面對嘅係求職困難嘅問題，佢覺得公司唔係搵佢係因為佢冇經驗同學歷。呢個係一個常見嘅問題，唔少人都係面對呢個問題。然而，我覺得呢個問題唔係單純係因為公司唔搵佢，亦唔係因為佢冇經驗同學歷。呢個問題係一個複雜嘅問題，需要考慮唔少因素。 [end of text]
