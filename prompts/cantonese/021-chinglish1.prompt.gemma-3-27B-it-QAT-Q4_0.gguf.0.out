Okay, here are my translations of the Chinglish phrases into Cantonese, based on the provided context and common Hong Kong usage.  I'll also include explanations where the translation isn't straightforward.  Please note that Chinglish is *highly* variable, and there can be multiple valid interpretations. I'll aim for the most likely meaning.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Romanization:** I'm using a fairly standard Jyutping romanization.
*   **Tone Marks:** I'm omitting tone marks for readability, but they are crucial for accurate pronunciation.
*   **Context is Key:** Some phrases are very colloquial and rely heavily on context.
*   **"Ah", "Lor", "Lah", "Ga"**: These are sentence-final particles that add nuance (emphasis, politeness, etc.). I'll try to reflect them in the translation where appropriate.

Here are the translations:

1.  **gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah**
    => 哥哥都有一份睇囉？ (go1 go1 dou1 jat1 fan6 tai2 lo1 a3?)
