### Notes:
- **Romanization Variability**: Chinglish heavily relies on non-standard romanizations, so the translations provided are interpretations based on common Cantonese to English romanization practices (e.g., Jyutping, Cantonese Yale).
- **Context Dependency**: Some translations might slightly vary in interpretation due to the lack of context (e.g., #8).
- **Grammar and Punctuation**: Cantonese, when written, often doesn’t translate directly to the grammatical structures of English. Punctuation in written Cantonese (especially in informal texts) can also be highly variable or omitted. [end of text]
