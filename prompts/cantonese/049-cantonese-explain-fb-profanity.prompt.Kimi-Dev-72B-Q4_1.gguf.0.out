◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a piece of text that's quite vulgar and emotional. The task is to analyze it and answer several questions. Let me start by understanding the content.

First, the text seems to be a rant from someone who's frustrated during a live performance. The person is using strong language, which suggests they're really upset. Let me try to parse the main points.

The author mentions that during a live show, there was an incident where someone shouted "encore!" before the song was finished. They react angrily, telling the person to shut up and questioning why they would call for an encore when the song isn't done. The author also criticizes the audience, saying Hong Kong people aren't worth watching live music and should just listen to recorded music instead.

Now, let's address each question step by step.

(0) Simplify the text: The author is angry because someone in the audience shouted "encore" while the song was still playing. They think the audience is rude and not deserving of live performances.

(1) Who is the author? The text doesn't specify, but given the context, it's likely a musician or performer on stage. They mention a band and a sister (maybe another band member), so maybe a lead singer or someone directly interacting with the crowd.

(2) Why are they angry? Because an audience member shouted "encore" before the song ended. This is disrespectful to the performers, as it interrupts the current performance. The author feels the audience isn't appreciating the live music properly.

(3) What are the注意事项 for watching live? Based on the text, the main point is not to shout "encore" until the performance is actually over. The performer expects the audience to be attentive and not disrupt the ongoing music. Also, showing respect by clapping and cheering appropriately, not by calling for more prematurely.

(4) Rewriting in polite language: The challenge here is to convey the same message without the vulgarity. The performer was upset when someone called for an encore before the song finished. They emphasized that the song wasn't over and asked the audience to be quiet. They expressed disappointment in the audience's behavior, suggesting that live performances are better appreciated when the audience is respectful.

So, the key points are the interruption during the song, the performer's frustration, and the call for better audience etiquette. The polite version should maintain the emotional tone but use respectful language.
