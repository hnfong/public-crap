The comment alleges that the award-winning police officer, 陳大文, was previously fired from a bank for embezzlement (穿櫃桶底) and that his character was questionable, raising doubts about how he passed the vetting process to become a police officer.

Whether or not you buy the story depends on several factors:

1. **Credibility of the Source**: The commenter claims to be a former colleague, but there is no way to verify their identity or their relationship with 陳大文. Anonymous comments on forums are inherently less credible because they lack accountability.

2. **Details and Evidence**: The comment provides some specific details, such as the bank being a "British-owned major bank" and the incident involving embezzlement. However, it lacks concrete evidence, such as official documents, witness testimonies, or any other form of proof.

3. **Context and Motivation**: The commenter might have a personal vendetta or bias against 陳大文, which could skew their perspective. Alternatively, the comment could be a fabrication or a misunderstanding of events.

4. **Vetting Process**: Police vetting processes are generally rigorous, and it's unlikely that someone with a history of embezzlement would pass such a process. However, it's also possible that the incident was not reported or that there were extenuating circumstances.

In conclusion, while the story raises questions, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the comment without further evidence. It could be true, but it could also be a malicious rumor or a misunderstanding. It would be prudent to approach such claims with skepticism until more concrete information is available.
