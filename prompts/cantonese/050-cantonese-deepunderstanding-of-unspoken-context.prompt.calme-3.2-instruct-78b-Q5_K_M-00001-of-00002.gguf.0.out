The individual, presumably a seasoned worker, is observing the job market, particularly the younger generation's struggle to find employment. He's perplexed by the reliance on cash wages as an incentive for job seekers, questioning the suitability of such individuals for roles that require such terms. He's critical of those lacking experience and education, wondering why they expect to be hired. He's expressing his own resilience, having started working at a young age, and his indifference to the common complaints about jobs being hard, dirty, having no future, and low pay. He concludes that those with poor credentials have no choice and that the issue of companies not being able to hire is not due to a lack of offers, but due to the job seekers' unrealistic expectations.

In terms of his conclusion, it's a complex issue. While it's true that job seekers with less experience or education might have fewer options, it's also important to consider the broader economic context, the job market's demand and supply, and the societal and educational structures that might have contributed to their lack of experience or education. His perspective might be biased by his own experiences and resilience, which might not be applicable to everyone. The issue of companies not being able to hire could be due to a mismatch between the skills offered and those required, or due to poor working conditions or pay that don't meet the minimum acceptable standards in the current job market.
