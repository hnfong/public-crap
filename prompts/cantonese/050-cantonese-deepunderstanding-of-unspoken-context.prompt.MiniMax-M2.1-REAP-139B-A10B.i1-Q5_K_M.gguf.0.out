**Overview of the Situation**

The speaker is a 13-year-old individual (referred to as "阿叔我13歲") who is trying to find a job ("搵工") but is encountering difficulties. He is frustrated because:

1. **His personal situation**: He has no experience ("冇經经验"), no qualifications/degree ("冇学历"), and presumably limited credentials to offer employers.

2. **The job market reality**: Companies use cash salaries ("现金粮") to attract job seekers, but the speaker's own conditions don't match what companies are looking for.

3. **His frustration**: He sees many people getting jobs but complaining about low pay ("人工低") or poor prospects, while he himself would be happy just to get any job at all, regardless of the conditions.

**The Problem**

The core problem is a mismatch between what the job market requires (experience, qualifications, competitive salary expectations) and what the speaker can offer (none of the above). He recognizes that companies are not at fault for offering low salaries—rather, the issue is that job seekers like himself lack the basic qualifications to even be considered for better-paying positions.

**Analysis of His Conclusion**

The speaker concludes that the reason people can't find jobs is not because companies don't offer enough ("公司唔頭offer唔夠"), but because the job seekers themselves have fundamental problems ("根本上啲人有問題").

**My Assessment**

I largely agree with his conclusion, but with some nuance:

1. **Agree**: It is true that in many job markets, especially competitive ones, the primary barrier for unqualified candidates is their own lack of qualifications. Companies aren't obligated to hire unqualified candidates, and offering "low salaries" is a separate issue from basic eligibility.

2. **However**: The speaker's situation (being only 13 years old) suggests he may be expecting too much too early. Entry-level jobs often exist for young people, but they typically have lower pay and fewer benefits. His frustration may stem from comparing himself to older, more experienced candidates rather than recognizing that his career path is simply at an earlier stage.

3. **Constructive perspective**: Rather than seeing this as a "problem with people," it might be more accurate to say that the speaker is simply not yet ready for the job market he's targeting. Building experience, skills, and qualifications is a gradual process.

**Conclusion**

The speaker's frustration is understandable, but his conclusion is partially correct: companies aren't the problem if they can't hire unqualified candidates. However, he might benefit from adjusting his expectations to match his current stage of life and focusing on gaining experience rather than competing for higher-paying positions. [end of text]
