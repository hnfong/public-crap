Got it, let's try to figure out whether to "buy the story" here. First, I need to understand what the user is asking: the original poster is a former colleague of Chen Dawen, an outstanding policeman who just got an award, and they're claiming that Chen was fired from a bank for "hiding in the cabinet" (衰穿櫃桶底) and that the boss threatened to call the police if he didn't leave immediately. Now, we need to assess the credibility of this claim.

First, let's break down the key points of the story: 1) Chen was a new employee, shadowing the poster for a week. 2) He was fired for "hiding in the cabinet"—wait, what does "衰穿櫃桶底" mean? Literally, "hiding under the cabinet" but probably a colloquial term, maybe "skulking in the cabinet" or maybe a mistranslation? Maybe it's "hiding in the storage closet" or perhaps a euphemism for something else, like theft? Wait, the original says "衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒"—"because he was hiding in the cabinet and got fired." But why would hiding in a cabinet lead to immediate firing with a threat to call the police? That seems odd. Hiding in a cabinet alone is usually a minor offense, maybe mischief, but threatening to call the police unless he leaves immediately suggests that there might be a more serious issue, not just hiding. Maybe the poster is simplifying or misinterpreting the reason?

Then, the poster says "his character has some problems, why did he pass the vetting?" The vetting for becoming a policeman is usually strict, including background checks, criminal records, character references, etc. If Chen was fired for a serious enough reason that the boss threatened to call the police, you'd think there would be a police record or at least a formal termination for cause, which might affect vetting. But the poster is questioning why he passed vetting, which implies that the poster believes the firing reason was serious enough to bar him, but maybe the actual reason was less serious than the poster claims?

Also, the timeline: he was fired from the bank, then "turned around and went to take the police exam"—so right after being fired, he became a policeman. Is that logistically possible? The police academy training takes time, so maybe "辗轉" (after some time) but the poster says "辗轉走左去考警察"—so after being fired, he went to take the exam. But if the firing was for a serious issue, would the vetting not catch it?

Another angle: the poster's motivation. They're commenting on a forum about an outstanding policeman receiving an award, so maybe there's jealousy or sour grapes? The poster was his colleague a year, but only mentions the negative incident—no other positive points, which is a red flag. People often remember negative events more, but a former colleague might mention at least some neutral or positive traits if it's a balanced memory. Here, it's just the firing story and a claim about character issues.

Also, the detail of "high-level executives came down with security to make him pack his things and leave"—that sounds dramatic. If it's just hiding in a cabinet, would the high-level come down personally? Maybe the poster is exaggerating the severity. Maybe the "hiding in the cabinet" was part of a larger incident, like theft? For example, if he was hiding stolen items in the cabinet, that would explain the threat to call the police. But the poster doesn't specify that—they just say "hiding in the cabinet." So maybe the poster is leaving out key details, making the story less credible.

Vetting process for police: in Hong Kong (since the terms are Cantonese, like "英資大行," "老細," "高層"), the police vetting (called "警隊背景調查") is thorough. It checks employment history, criminal records, references, etc. If Chen was fired for a minor offense, like hiding in a cabinet as a prank, maybe the bank didn't report it to the police, so no criminal record, and the vetting might not find it problematic. But if it was something illegal, like theft, the bank would have called the police, so there would be a record, and he wouldn't pass vetting. The poster is confused why he passed vetting, which suggests that the poster's own understanding of the reason for firing is either incorrect or exaggerated.

Also, the term "衰穿櫃桶底"—maybe it's a mistranslation or misusage. "穿櫃桶底" literally is "to hide under the cabinet," but colloquially, maybe it means "to be caught stealing from the cash register" or "to hide stolen goods"? Because in some contexts, hiding in a cabinet near the cash register might be associated with theft. If that's the case, the poster might be using a euphemism, but even then, if there was no police report, the vetting might not pick it up.

Another point: the poster says "he was shadowing me for the first week"—so they only worked together for a week? Wait, "新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow"—first week of employment, shadowing the poster. So the poster only knew him for a week, then he was fired. Is a one-week acquaintance's account reliable? Maybe, but the poster is making a claim about his character based on a one-week interaction and a single incident. That's not enough to judge someone's character, let alone claim they have "some problems" that would disqualify them from police.

Also, the outcome: Chen is now an outstanding policeman. If the poster's story is true, that would mean the vetting process failed, which is unlikely because police vetting is strict. So the inconsistency between the story's implied severity and the successful vetting/award makes the story less credible.

Possible biases: the poster might be resentful because Chen succeeded despite what they see as a past mistake. Or maybe they misremembered the events—maybe the firing was for a different reason, and they're projecting their own negative feelings onto it.

In summary, the story has several red flags: vague reason for firing (hiding in cabinet doesn't justify police threat), dramatic exaggeration of the termination process (high-level with security), limited acquaintance (only one week of shadowing), inconsistency with strict police vetting, and potential motivation (jealousy/sour grapes). Therefore, the story is not very credible; I wouldn't buy it.</seed:think>To assess the credibility of the former colleague’s story, we can analyze key elements, potential biases, and logical inconsistencies:


### **1. Vagueness and Unsubstantiated Severity of the "Firing Offense"**  
The core claim is that Chen was fired for "hiding in the cabinet" (*衰穿櫃桶底*). This is extremely vague—hiding in a cabinet alone is a minor, trivial offense (e.g., mischief) and does not justify the dramatic response described: *"the boss threatened to call the police if he didn’t leave immediately, and senior executives came with security to make him pack his things."*  

For a company to escalate to threats of police involvement and involve senior management, there must be a **serious underlying issue** (e.g., theft, fraud, violence) — not just hiding. The poster does not specify this, suggesting either exaggeration or misrepresentation of the true reason for termination.


### **2. Inconsistency with Police Vetting Standards**  
The poster questions, *"Why did he pass vetting?"* implying the firing reason was severe enough to bar him from policing. However, police vetting in Hong Kong (where the Cantonese terms suggest the context) is rigorous but **relies on verified records**: criminal convictions, formal employment disciplinary actions, or police reports.  

If Chen had been fired for a crime (e.g., theft), the bank would have filed a police report, creating a permanent record that would disqualify him. Since he became an "outstanding policeman," it’s far more likely the alleged "hiding in the cabinet" was a minor incident (unreported to police) or a misremembered event—undermining the poster’s claim of "character issues."


### **3. Limited Acquaintance and Selective Memory**  
The poster notes, *"He shadowed me for the first week of his employment"*—meaning they only worked together for **one week**. Judging someone’s "character" based on a single week (and one incident) is deeply unreliable. People often fixate on negative outliers, especially if they later achieve success (the poster may be projecting resentment here).


### **4. Motivational Bias: Potential Sour Grapes**  
The story is posted on a forum celebrating Chen’s award as an "outstanding policeman." The poster’s focus on a decades-old, minor (and unproven) firing incident, rather than any positive traits, suggests **jealousy or bitterness**—a common bias that undermines credibility.


### **Conclusion**  
The story is not credible. It relies on vague, exaggerated details, contradicts the rigor of police vetting, and is colored by the poster’s limited acquaintance and potential resentment. There is no evidence to support the claim that Chen’s character was compromised by the alleged bank incident.


**Answer:** I don’t buy the story. It’s filled with unsubstantiated details (e.g., "hiding in a cabinet" justifying police threats), contradicts strict police vetting standards, and is likely driven by the poster’s bias or misremembering. [end of text]
