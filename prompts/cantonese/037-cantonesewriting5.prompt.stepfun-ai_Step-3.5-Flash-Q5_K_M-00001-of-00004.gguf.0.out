好的，用户要求用广东话“睇怕”造10个例句并附英文翻译。先确认“睇怕”的意思和用法——这个词在粤语里表示“看起来好像”“似乎”，带推测语气，比“似乎”更口语化。

用户特别强调要用广东话语法，比如“嘅”“係”，不能套用普通话结构。例子中用了“威水”展示格式，所以回复要严格遵循：先标注词条，再列10句粤语例句，每句后括号内英文翻译。

需要确保例句覆盖不同场景，比如天气、人事、天气、情绪等，体现“睇怕”的推测功能。同时注意粤语特有表达，比如“落狗屎”指大雨，“食得鹹魚”比喻要承担后果。

英文翻译要准确传达推测语气，用“seems like”“looks as if”等。避免直译，比如“睇怕要落狗屎”译成“Looks like it's going to pour”比“seems to rain dogs”更自然。

检查例句是否重复，是否都符合粤语口语习惯。比如“佢睇怕唔係好鍾意呢份禮物”用“鍾意”而非“喜欢”，保持用词地道。最后确认格式：词条、10句、英文翻译，无额外解释。
