## Alice:  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing, gah.  
But I never gamble, okay?  
:)

## Bob:  
Well... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)  
Except that one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:  
A few weeks ago, Joe got mad, right?

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, you know.  
I said, "Sure, let’s play."  
Then he said, "One cent per card..." (because he’s really good).  
I thought, "Well, okay, worst case I lose maybe $10 or so..."  

## Alice:  
So you did it?  
:)  
Hehe. It’s actually fun, but if you’re serious about gambling, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:  
But it’s not good to be so strict about it...  
If you have to gamble, it gets really stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:  
Me? The program?  
Nope.  
I don’t even know how to download it or anything.  
:)

## Bob:  
Well, if you want to play online, you definitely need a program, right?  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait a sec...

## Alice:  
Huh?  
:)  
No way.  
Hehe. [end of text]
