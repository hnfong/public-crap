The story seems to be a personal anecdote from someone who worked with the award-winning policeman, Chen Dawen, in a bank before he became a police officer. The narrator describes Chen as someone who was fired from his job at the bank for being incompetent and causing problems, and expresses surprise that he was able to pass the vetting process to become a police officer.

While it's impossible to know for certain whether the story is true or not without further evidence, there are a few things to consider:

1. The narrator claims to have worked with Chen in a bank, which could be verified if the bank has records of their employment.

2. The story is quite specific in its details, which could suggest that it's based on a real experience.

3. The narrator expresses surprise that Chen was able to become a police officer, which could suggest that they are not aware of any changes in Chen's behavior or circumstances since they last worked with him.

Overall, while the story is intriguing, it's important to approach it with a critical eye and consider the possibility that it may not be entirely accurate. Without further evidence, it's impossible to say for certain whether the story is true or not. [end of text]
