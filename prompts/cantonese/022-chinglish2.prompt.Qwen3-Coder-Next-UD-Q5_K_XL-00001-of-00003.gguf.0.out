## Alice:  
Ha!  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing—very much!  
But I never gamble, though.  
:)  

## Bob:  
Oh… I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:  
A few weeks ago—Joe Mud, right?  

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, so I said, “Sure, let’s play!”  
He said, “1 cent per card” (because he’s really good at it).  
I thought, “Hmm, okay, why not?” Besides, at most I’d lose around $10, right?  

## Alice:  
Ah, I see.  
:)  
Hehe. You really went for it!  
It’s actually fun—but if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t fully enjoy the game.  

## Bob:  
But it’s not great to “stick to your guns” too much, you know…  
Yeah, gambling can be really stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:  
The program?  
Hmm…  
I don’t think I downloaded anything like that.  
:)  

## Bob:  
Well, to play online, you obviously need a program, right?  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you could get it from me via FTP or HTTP… Wait…  

## Alice:  
Oh, okay.  
:)  
I’ll let you know.  
Hehe [end of text]
