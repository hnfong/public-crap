Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play, but I never gamble, okay?
:)

**Bob:**
Or... I never gamble on Big2 either, except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago, Joe, right?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2.
I said, "Okay, let's play."
He said, "One cent per card" (because he is very good at it).
I thought, "That's a good deal." Besides, I would only lose maybe $10 at most.

**Alice:**
Wow, you're lucky.
Hehe. But you know, it's actually good. But if you start gambling, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**
But it's not good to be so stubborn about not gambling.
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
Which program?
Yes, I have it. Do you need me to download something?
:)

**Bob:**
Well, of course, you need a program to play online.
My current client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe I can send it to you via FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:**
Okay, sure.
:)
No problem.
Hehe. [end of text]
