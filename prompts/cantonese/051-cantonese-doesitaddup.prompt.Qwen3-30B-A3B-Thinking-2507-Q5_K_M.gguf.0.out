Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a forum comment in Cantonese about a police officer who received an award, but the comment claims the officer was fired from a bank job for a mistake and then became a cop. The user is asking if I believe the story and to explain.

First, I need to understand the Cantonese text. Let me translate it to English to make sure I get the details right. The commenter says they were a colleague of Chen Dawen, an outstanding police officer, at a British bank. They mention that Chen was fired in his first week because he "failed to wear the bottom of the cabinet" (which might be a mistranslation or typo), and the boss told him to leave immediately or they'd call the police. Then, after lunch, the manager and security came to escort him out. After that, he went to become a police officer. The commenter questions why he passed the vetting process given his character issues.

Wait, "衰穿櫃桶底" – "衰穿" might mean "failed" or "made a mistake," and "櫃桶底" could be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "櫃檯" (counter) or "櫃桶" (cabinet), but "穿櫃桶底" doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃" (wrong cabinet) or "穿錯櫃底" (wrong cabinet bottom), but that's unclear. Maybe it's a mishearing of "穿錯鞋" (wore wrong shoes), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, "櫃桶" might be a typo for "櫃檯" (counter), so "穿錯櫃檯" (wrong counter), but still not sure.

The key points are: the officer was fired from a bank job in the first week for some mistake, then became a police officer, and the commenter is skeptical about how he passed vetting.

Now, the user is asking if I buy the story. So I need to assess the credibility of the comment.

First, check for inconsistencies. The story says he was fired for a mistake in the first week, but the comment says "新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow" – meaning he shadowed the commenter in his first week. If he was fired in the first week, how did he shadow for a week? That's a contradiction. If he was fired on the first day, he wouldn't have shadowed for a week. So that's a red flag.

Also, "衰穿櫃桶底" – if it's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be "穿錯櫃" (wrong cabinet), but even then, the mistake leading to immediate firing seems odd. Banks usually have training periods, and a first-week mistake might not lead to immediate termination unless it's severe, like theft or fraud. But the comment says "比人炒" (fired), so maybe it's a minor mistake, but the story seems inconsistent.

Another point: the commenter says the boss said "you don't leave today, we'll call the police." But if the employee was fired, the company would just let them go, not call the police. Unless the employee was causing a disturbance, but the comment says he was fired for a mistake, not for misconduct. So that part seems off.

Also, the commenter claims the officer has character issues but passed vetting. Vetting for police usually involves background checks, criminal records, references, etc. If he was fired for a mistake, maybe it's not a criminal issue, but if he had a history of problems, vetting might catch it. But the comment says he was fired for a mistake, not a crime, so maybe vetting would still pass him. But the commenter is skeptical, which might be a red herring.

Wait, the main inconsistency is the timeline. If he was fired in the first week, he couldn't have shadowed for a week. The comment says "新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow" – so he was shadowing during his first week, which implies he was still employed for that week. Then, after that week, he was fired. But the comment says "頭一個禮拜" (first week), so maybe he was fired at the end of the first week. But the next part says "老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官" – the boss said if he doesn't leave today, they'll report him. So maybe he was fired on the last day of the first week, and had to leave immediately. But the shadowing happened during the first week, so that part is possible.

But the typo "衰穿櫃桶底" is confusing. Maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃" (wrong cabinet), but "櫃桶" isn't a standard term. Maybe it's "穿錯鞋" (wore wrong shoes), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, "櫃" could be a typo for "櫃檯" (counter), so "穿錯櫃檯" (wrong counter), but still unclear.

Another angle: the commenter is trying to discredit the officer by saying he was fired from a bank job, implying he's not trustworthy, but the officer is now an award-winning cop. The commenter might be spreading rumors, especially since the story has inconsistencies.

Also, the phrase "輾轉走左去考警察" – "then he went to become a police officer." But becoming a police officer usually requires passing exams and vetting, not just "going to take the exam." So maybe he applied after being fired, which is possible.

But the main red flag is the timeline. If he was fired in the first week, he wouldn't have had time to shadow for a week. Wait, "頭一個禮拜" means the first week, so he was employed for the first week, shadowing, then fired. So the shadowing happened during the first week, then he was fired. That's possible. So maybe the timeline is okay.

But the mistake: "衰穿櫃桶底" – maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃" (wrong cabinet), but "櫃桶" might be a mishearing of "櫃檯" (counter). If he was supposed to be at the counter but went to the wrong cabinet, maybe he messed up a transaction. But why would that lead to immediate firing? Maybe it's a minor mistake, but banks usually don't fire people for that immediately. More likely, it's a made-up story to discredit him.

Also, the comment says "佢個人品有啲問題" – his character has issues. But if he was fired for a mistake, not for character, maybe the commenter is conflating the two. If he was fired for a mistake, it's not necessarily a character issue. So the commenter might be trying to imply he's dishonest or something, but the actual reason was a mistake.

Another point: the commenter says "唔知點解會過到vetting個關" – "don't know why he passed the vetting." Vetting for police usually includes checking for criminal records, past employment issues, etc. If he was fired from a bank, that might be noted in his employment history, but if it was a minor mistake and he explained it, vetting might still pass him. So the commenter's skepticism might be unfounded.

But the main issue is whether the story is credible. The key inconsistency is the typo and the timeline. If "衰穿櫃桶底" is a typo for something else, but as written, it's unclear. Also, the immediate firing for a mistake seems unlikely, but possible if it's a serious error.

Wait, "衰穿" – "衰" means bad luck or failure, "穿" might be a typo for "穿錯" (wore wrong), but "櫃桶底" – "櫃" is cabinet, "桶" is bucket, "底" is bottom. So "cabinet bucket bottom" – that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃底" (wrong cabinet bottom), but still odd. Maybe it's supposed to be "穿錯鞋" (wore wrong shoes), which is a common mistake, but why would that get you fired? Maybe the commenter is making up a story.

Also, the phrase "比人炒" – "fired by the company," which is correct. "老細" is boss. "報官" is report to police. So the boss said if he doesn't leave, they'll call the police. But if he's being fired for a mistake, why would they call the police? Unless he was causing a disturbance, but the comment says it's for a mistake. So that part is suspicious.

Putting it all together, the story has several inconsistencies: the typo makes the mistake unclear, the immediate firing for a minor mistake is unlikely, and the boss threatening to call the police when firing for a mistake doesn't make sense. Therefore, the story is probably fabricated to discredit the officer.

So the answer should be that I don't buy the story because of the inconsistencies and implausible details.
</think>

I do **not** buy this story. Here's why, based on the inconsistencies and implausibilities in the account:

---

### 1. **Timeline Contradiction**
   - The commenter claims the officer (Chen Dawen) was **fired in his first week** after "shadowing" them.  
   - However, the phrase *"新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow"* (he shadowed me in his first week) implies he was **still employed** during that week.  
   - If he was fired *during* that week, he couldn’t have shadowed for a full week. This is a logical inconsistency.

---

### 2. **"衰穿櫃桶底" is Nonsense**
   - The phrase *"衰穿櫃桶底"* (literally "failed to wear cabinet bucket bottom") is **grammatically and contextually nonsensical**.  
   - Likely a typo or deliberate fabrication. Possible intended phrases:
     - *"穿錯櫃"* (wore wrong cabinet) → Still illogical (cabinets aren’t worn).
     - *"穿錯鞋"* (wore wrong shoes) → A minor mistake, but **not grounds for immediate firing**.
     - *"穿錯櫃檯"* (wrong counter) → Still unclear and unlikely to justify termination.
   - Banks don’t fire employees for trivial errors like this without prior warnings. This detail reeks of a made-up excuse.

---

### 3. **"報官" (Call the Police) is Illogical**
   - The boss supposedly said: *"你唔即日走的話就報官"* ("If you don’t leave today, we’ll report you to the police").  
   - **Why would a company report an employee to the police for a work mistake?**  
     - Firing for incompetence is a **civil matter**, not a criminal one.  
     - The only scenario where this would make sense is if the employee **stole something or committed fraud** (e.g., "穿錯櫃" = stole from a cabinet). But the story doesn’t say this—it just claims a vague "mistake."  
   - This detail feels like a **deliberate exaggeration** to paint the officer as dishonest.

---

### 4. **Vetting Process is Misunderstood**
   - The commenter claims: *"佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關"* ("He has character issues, but I don’t know how he passed vetting").  
   - **Police vetting is rigorous** and includes:
     - Criminal record checks.
     - Employment history (including *why* he was fired).
     - References from past employers.
   - If he was fired for a **minor mistake** (not a crime), vetting would likely still pass him.  
   - If he was fired for **serious misconduct** (e.g., theft), vetting would **reject** him. The commenter’s confusion suggests they don’t understand the process.

---

### 5. **Motivation: Discrediting the Officer**
   - The story is **clearly designed to undermine** the officer’s award.  
   - It’s common for disgruntled ex-colleagues to spread rumors about someone who has "made it big" (e.g., becoming a police officer after a failed bank job).  
   - The vague, contradictory details ("cabinet bucket bottom," "report to police") are classic signs of a **fabricated story**.

---

### Conclusion
This story is **unreliable** due to:
- A **broken timeline** (fired during the week he was shadowing).
- A **nonsensical reason** for termination ("cabinet bucket bottom").
- An **illogical threat** to "report to police" for a minor mistake.
- A **misunderstanding of police vetting**.

**Why would someone post this?**  
To tarnish the officer’s reputation, likely out of jealousy or resentment. The story is **not credible**—it’s a red herring meant to distract from the officer’s actual achievements.

> 💡 **Key Takeaway**: If a story has **unexplained typos**, **logical gaps**, and **emotional bias**, it’s almost certainly false. Always verify claims with facts, not anecdotes. [end of text]
