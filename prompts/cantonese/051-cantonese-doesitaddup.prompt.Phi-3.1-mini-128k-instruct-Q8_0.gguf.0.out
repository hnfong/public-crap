 As an AI developed by Microsoft, I don't form personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can analyze the situation based on the information provided.

The individual in question claims to have worked with the award-winning policeman for a year at a bank before their current job. They mention that they had a good impression of the policeman, which could be due to their professionalism, dedication, or other positive attributes.

The person also states that they were shadowing the award-winning policeman on their first day of work, which could have contributed to their positive impression. This experience might have given them insight into the policeman's work ethic, problem-solving skills, and ability to handle challenging situations.

The individual's claim that they were called in to handle a situation involving the award-winning policeman being accused of corruption and subsequently being arrested raises some concerns. It's essential to consider the context and details surrounding this incident. If the award-winning policeman was indeed involved in corruption, it's crucial to ensure that the investigation is conducted fairly and transparently, with all relevant evidence considered.

The individual's statement that they were called in because the award-winning policeman was "suffering from the bottom of the desk" and that they were "shadowing" them on their first day of work seems unusual and potentially suspicious. It's essential to verify the accuracy of these claims and the circumstances surrounding the incident.

In conclusion, while the individual's positive impression of the award-winning policeman is understandable, the details surrounding the incident involving the award-winning policeman's arrest raise some concerns. It's crucial to ensure that the investigation is conducted fairly and transparently, with all relevant evidence considered. [end of text]
