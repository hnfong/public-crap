<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "懵然不知". Format:

# 懵然不知
(pos:??) maybe 名詞? It's an idiom meaning "bewildered, clueless". It's an idiom phrase, maybe "成語" or "idiom". In dictionary, we can label as "成語" or "idiom". But the example uses (pos:名詞). For idioms, maybe (pos:成語). But we can keep (pos:成語). Provide explanation in Cantonese and English. Provide example sentence in Cantonese with romanization and English translation.

We must use Cantonese grammar: "嘅" not "的", "係" not "是". Provide explanation: "懵然不知" 形容對某件事完全唔明白，感到迷惑、茫然。 Provide English: "to be bewildered, clueless".

Example: "佢聽到呢個問題，懵然不知點樣答。" (He heard this question and was clueless about how to answer.) Provide romanization: "keoi5 teng1 dou3 ni1 go3 man6 tai4, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 daap3." Wait romanization: "keoi5" for 佢, "teng1" for 聽, "dou3" for 到, "ni1" for 呢, "go3" for 個, "man6" for 問, "tai4" for 題, "mung5" for 懵, "jin4" for 然, "bat1" for 不, "zi1" for 知, "dim2" for 點, "joeng6" for 何, "daap3" for 答. But we need to ensure correct romanization: "懵然不知" is "mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1". So example: "佢聽到呢個問題，懵然不知點樣答。" romanization: "keoi5 teng1 dou3 ni1 go3 man6 tai4, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 daap3." Provide English translation: "He heard the question and was clueless about how to answer."

Also maybe another example: "我見到佢講話，完全懵然不知佢講咩。" But one example is enough.

We need to include <explanation> and <eg> tags. Provide explanation in Cantonese and English. Use "yue:" and "eng:" tags.

Let's produce:

# 懵然不知
(pos:成語)
<explanation>
yue:形容對某件事完全唔明白，感到迷惑、茫然。  
eng:An idiom meaning to be bewildered or clueless about something.
<eg>
yue:佢聽到呢個問題，懵然不知點樣答。 (keoi5 teng1 dou3 ni1 go3 man6 tai4, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 daap3.)  
eng:He heard the question and was clueless about how to answer.

Check grammar: "佢聽到呢個問題，懵然不知點樣答。" Good.

Make sure romanization uses numbers for tones. Provide "keoi5" etc. Provide "teng1" etc. Provide "mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1" etc.

Also maybe include "yue:" for explanation and "eng:" for explanation. Provide "yue:" for example and "eng:" for translation.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 懵然不知
