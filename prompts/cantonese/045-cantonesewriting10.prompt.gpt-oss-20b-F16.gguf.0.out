<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "懵然不知". Format:

# 懵然不知
(pos:??) maybe 名詞? It's an idiom meaning "bewildered, clueless". It's an idiom phrase, maybe "成語" or "idiom". In dictionary, we can label as "成語" or "idiom". But the example uses (pos:名詞). For idioms, maybe "成語". But we can keep (pos:成語). But the example uses (pos:名詞). We can choose (pos:成語). But the instruction: "按："yue" 係粵語(廣東話)嘅意思，而 "eng" 指英文." So we need to provide explanation in Cantonese and English. Provide example sentence in Canton语 and English.

We need to use Cantonese grammar: "懵然不知" meaning "to be clueless, bewildered". Provide explanation: "形容人對某件事完全唔明白，感到迷惑、無頭緒". Provide example: "佢見到新同事，懵然不知點樣同佢打招呼。"

Also provide English: "to be clueless, bewildered". Example: "He was clueless about how to greet the new colleague."

We need to use Cantonese romanization? The example uses romanization: "lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2." So we need to provide romanization for the example sentence. Provide Cantonese romanization using Jyutping. For "懵然不知" maybe "mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1"? Actually "懵然" is "mung5 jin4" or "mung5 jin4"? Wait "懵然" is "mung5 jin4" or "mung5 jin4"? Let's check: "懵然" is "mung5 jin4" maybe. "不知" is "bat1 zi1". So "懵然不知" is "mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1". But we can just provide the phrase in Cantonese romanization: "mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1". But we might not need to provide romanization for the phrase itself. But we can provide romanization for the example sentence.

Let's produce:

# 懵然不知
(pos:成語)
<explanation>
yue:形容對某件事完全唔明白，感到迷惑、無頭緒。  
eng:to be clueless, bewildered; to have no idea about something.

<eg>
yue:佢見到新同事，懵然不知點樣同佢打招呼。 (keoi5 gin3 dou3 san1 tung4 si6, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 tung4 keoi5 daa2 ziu1 fu1.)  
eng:He was clueless about how to greet the new colleague.

But we need to ensure we use Cantonese grammar: "佢見到新同事，懵然不知點樣同佢打招呼。" That is correct. Provide romanization: "keoi5 gin3 dou3 san1 tung4 si6, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 tung4 keoi5 daa2 ziu1 fu1." Wait "打招呼" is "daa2 ziu1 fu1" or "daa2 ziu1 fu1"? Actually "打招呼" is "daa2 ziu1 fu1" or "daa2 ziu1 fu1"? Let's check: "招呼" is "ziu1 fu1". So "打招呼" is "daa2 ziu1 fu1". So romanization: "daa2 ziu1 fu1". So the example: "keoi5 gin3 dou3 san1 tung4 si6, mung5 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 joeng6 tung4 keoi5 daa2 ziu1 fu1." That seems fine.

But we might also provide a second example: "佢聽到問題，懵然不知點答。"

But we only need one example.

Also we need to include "yue" and "eng" tags for explanation and example.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

But we need to ensure we follow the format exactly:

```
# 懵然不知
(pos:成語)
<explanation>
yue:...
eng:...
<eg>
yue:...
eng:...
```

Yes.
