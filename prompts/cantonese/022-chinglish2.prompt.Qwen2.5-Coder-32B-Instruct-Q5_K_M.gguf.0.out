Sure, here's the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I like to play a lot, though.
But I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either.
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
I said, "Sure, play."
He said, "1 cent for a card..." (because he plays very well).
I said, "Okay," but at most, I could lose something like $10.

## Alice:
Okay, that's fine.
:)
Haha. It's good actually. But if I have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

## Bob:
But it's not very good to "stand so hard"...
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
Meh, the program.
No.
Have you downloaded it or something?
:)

## Bob:
To play online, you need a program.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

## Alice:
Okay, alright.
:)
No go.
Haha [end of text]
