The paragraph appears to be written in Cantonese and discusses the challenges faced by an individual, referred to as "阿叔" (Uncle), in finding a job. Uncle is likely a young person, around 13 years old, who is struggling to find employment. The primary issues he faces are the lack of experience and education, which makes it difficult for him to compete in the job market. The paragraph also touches on the expectation for companies to provide financial incentives to attract job seekers, which Uncle finds burdensome and unpromising.

From an objective standpoint, the situation of Uncle is quite challenging. He is young and lacks the necessary qualifications to secure a job, which is a common problem faced by many young people entering the workforce. The reliance on financial incentives from companies to attract job seekers is a valid concern, as it may not always be feasible for individuals without experience or education.
 Writers often express frustration with the job market, and it's understandable that Uncle feels this way. However, it's essential to consider that the job market is competitive, and individuals must take responsibility for their own career development. While financial incentives can be helpful, they should not be the sole focus when seeking employment.

In conclusion, I agree with Uncle's sentiment that the job market can be challenging, especially for those without experience or education. However, it's also important to recognize the need for personal growth and development in order to improve one's chances of finding employment.<|end|>
