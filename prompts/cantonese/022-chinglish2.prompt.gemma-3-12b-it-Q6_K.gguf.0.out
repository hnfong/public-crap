Okay, here's a translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English, explaining some of the slang/dialect used:

**Alice:**

Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play [Big Two - a card game] a lot.
But I never gamble [bet money].
:)

**Bob:**

Right... I never gamble on Big Two either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**

A few weeks ago, at Joe's place? (Referring to a friend's house)

**Bob:**

Yeah, I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
So I said, "okay, let's play."
He said, "one cent for a card..." (Because he's really good at it).
So I said, "Okay, fine" (basically agreeing). Besides, I'd only lose about $10 at most, right?

**Alice:**

Okay, you're right.
:)
Haha. It's good that you played a little bit.
It's good actually. But if you were to gamble a lot, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**

But it's not very good to be *too* serious [about the game].
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful...
By the way, do you have the program [for playing Big Two online]?

**Alice:**

The program?
No.
Have you downloaded it or something?
:)

**Bob:**

Of course, you need a program to play online!
My computer program doesn't let me send files yet... Maybe I can get it to you using FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:**

Okay, got it.
:)
I understand.
Haha.
