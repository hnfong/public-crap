Sure! Here’s the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games.  
But I never gamble for real.  
:)  

---

**Bob:**  
Oh... I never gamble on big2 either.  
Except once a few weeks ago.

---

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, really? What happened?

---

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play big2.  
I said let's just play for fun instead.  
He wanted to bet only one cent per card because he's really good at it.  
I lost, but I didn't lose much—maybe just around $10.

---

**Alice:**  
You played games.  
:)  
It's actually good to play like that. But if you don't play well, I wouldn't enjoy it as much.

---

**Bob:**  
But it's not good to stress too much about winning.  
It's stressful to gamble a lot.  
By the way, do you have the program to play online?

---

**Alice:**  
No, the program.  
Hehe.  
You and your friend can download it or something.  
:)  

---

**Bob:**  
Yeah, you need a program to play online.  
My program can't send files yet... Maybe you can get it from me later, by email or something... Wait...

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Hehe.  
I get it.  
You're funny.

Let me know if you want it even simpler or more literal! [end of text]
