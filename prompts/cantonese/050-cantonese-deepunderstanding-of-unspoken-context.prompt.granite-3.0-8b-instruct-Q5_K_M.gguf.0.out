The user is expressing frustration about the current job market, where many job seekers are unable to find employment despite having good looks. The user believes that companies are using cash incentives to attract job seekers, but they are not qualified for these positions. The user also mentions that there are many people in the job market, and it is difficult to find a job that matches one's qualifications. The user concludes that the problem lies with the job seekers themselves, as they lack experience and education.

The user's conclusion is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many job seekers may lack experience and education, it is not fair to blame them solely for their inability to find employment. The job market is highly competitive, and there are many factors that can affect a person's chances of finding a job, such as the economy, industry trends, and company policies. Additionally, some companies may prioritize certain qualifications over others, which can make it difficult for job seekers to find a position that matches their skills and experience.

Overall, the user's frustration is understandable, but it is important to consider the complexities of the job market and avoid making sweeping generalizations about job seekers.
