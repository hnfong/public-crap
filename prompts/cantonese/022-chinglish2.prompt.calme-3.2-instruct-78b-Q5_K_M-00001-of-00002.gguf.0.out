## Alice:
I laughed.
Me too.
I really like to play a lot, but I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
I also never gamble in Big2, except for a time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, what happened?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
I agreed to play.
He suggested 1 cent for each card, because he's very good.
I thought it was "so hing" (a term possibly related to a gambling superstition or a local phrase), but at most, I could lose around $10.

## Alice:
You're right.
:)
Hehe. If you insist on gambling, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:
It's not good to be too rigid.
If gambling is involved, it's very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
What program?
I don't.
Do I need to download it or something?
:)

## Bob:
To play online, you obviously need a program to play.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me through FTP or HTTP... wait...

## Alice:
I understand.
:)
I'll say.
Hehe. [end of text]
