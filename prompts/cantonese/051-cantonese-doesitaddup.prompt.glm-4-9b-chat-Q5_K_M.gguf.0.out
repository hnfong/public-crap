As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or the ability to verify stories, but I can analyze the content of the comment and provide some considerations that might help determine the credibility of the story.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Personal Anecdote**: The comment is a personal anecdote from someone who claims to have worked with the individual in question. Personal stories can be compelling, but they are also subjective and based on the perspective of the narrator.

2. **Specific Details**: The comment includes specific details about the incident, such as the name of the bank, the nature of the incident, and the consequences faced by the individual. However, the authenticity of these details cannot be independently verified without further evidence.

3. **Allegations of Character**: The comment makes allegations about the character of the individual, suggesting that they had issues and were fired due to poor performance. Character attacks can be difficult to prove, and the comment does not provide any evidence to support these claims.

4. **The Award**: The individual in question received an award for being an outstanding policeman. This is a significant achievement, and it would be unusual for someone with serious character issues to be recognized in this way unless there was a change in their behavior or circumstances.

5. **The Vetting Process**: The comment mentions that the individual passed a vetting process to become a police officer. This process is rigorous and designed to ensure that only suitable candidates are accepted. It is unlikely that someone with significant character issues would pass such a vetting without some form of oversight or mistake.

6. **The Shadowing Incident**: The comment describes an incident where the individual was "shadowed" and eventually escorted out of the building. This could be seen as a serious event, but it is also a single incident that does not necessarily reflect the individual's overall character or suitability for a career in law enforcement.

In conclusion, while the story is told with a certain level of detail and passion, it lacks concrete evidence to support the claims made. The credibility of the story depends on the reliability of the narrator and the accuracy of the information provided. Without additional evidence or corroboration, it is difficult to determine the truth of the story. It's also worth noting that people can change over time, and the individual's past behavior does not necessarily predict their future actions or suitability for a role in law enforcement.
