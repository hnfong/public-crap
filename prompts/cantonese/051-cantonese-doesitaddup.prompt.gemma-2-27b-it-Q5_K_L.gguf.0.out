The story raises several red flags and it's understandable to be skeptical. Here's why:

* **Anonymity:** The commenter is anonymous, making it impossible to verify their identity or connection to the officer.
* **Vague Details:** The commenter provides few specifics about the alleged incident. What exactly was "stolen" from the vault? What was the nature of the "problem" with the officer's character?
* **One-Sided Account:** The story only presents the commenter's perspective. There's no opportunity to hear the officer's side of the story or any corroborating evidence.
* **Timing:** The comment appears shortly after the officer received an award, suggesting a possible motive for discrediting them.

**Vetting Process:**

Police vetting processes are rigorous and designed to weed out individuals with questionable backgrounds. It's unlikely someone who stole from a bank would pass such scrutiny.

**Conclusion:**

While the commenter's story is concerning, it lacks credibility due to its anonymity, vagueness, and potential bias. It's important to approach such claims with caution and avoid jumping to conclusions. 

It's best to wait for more information or evidence to emerge before forming an opinion about the officer's character. [end of text]
