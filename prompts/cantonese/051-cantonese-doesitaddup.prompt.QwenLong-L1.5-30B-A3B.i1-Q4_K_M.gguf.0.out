Okay, let's tackle this query. So, the user provided a forum comment in Cantonese about a person who recently got an award for being an outstanding policeman. The commenter claims to be a former colleague from a British bank, saying they worked with Chen Dawen, a police officer, for a year. The story goes that Chen was fired in his first week because he "failed to wear the bottom of the cabinet" (which I think is a mistranslation or typo), and the boss told him to leave immediately or they'd call the police. Then, the next day, after lunch, the management and security escorted him out. After that, he went on to become a police officer, but the commenter questions how he passed the vetting process because of his character issues.

First, I need to figure out if the story is believable. Let me break it down. The main points are:

1. The commenter was a former colleague of Chen Dawen at a British bank.
2. Chen was fired in his first week for "衰穿櫃桶底" (which translates to "failed to wear the bottom of the cabinet" – that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo or mistranslation. Let me check the Cantonese. "衰穿櫃桶底" – "衰" means bad luck or failure, "穿" is to wear through, "櫃桶底" might be a typo. Maybe "櫃" is cabinet, "桶" is bucket, "底" is bottom. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be "穿錯櫃桶底" or "穿錯底"? Wait, "櫃桶" isn't a standard term. Maybe it's a typo for "櫃檯" (counter) or "櫃員" (teller). Wait, "櫃桶底" – maybe "櫃" is cabinet, "桶" is bucket, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mishearing of "穿錯底" or "穿錯褲底"? Wait, "穿" can mean to wear, so "穿錯底" might mean wearing the wrong bottom part, like underwear? But that's a bit odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯褲" (wearing the wrong pants), but "櫃桶底" is confusing. Let me think. Maybe "櫃" is a typo for "褲" (pants), so "穿錯褲桶底" – but "褲桶" isn't right. Wait, "褲" is pants, "桶" is bucket, so maybe "褲桶底" is a typo for "褲底" (crotch of pants), so "穿錯褲底" meaning he wore his pants inside out or something? But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistranslation of a Chinese phrase. Let me check the original Cantonese.

The original says: "佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒". "衰穿" might be "failed to wear" or "wore badly". "櫃桶底" – maybe "櫃" is a typo for "褲" (pants), so "穿褲桶底" – but "褲桶" isn't standard. Wait, maybe it's "穿錯櫃" (wore the wrong cabinet?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯底" (wore the wrong bottom), but "底" could refer to the bottom of something. Wait, in a bank, maybe "櫃" is counter, so "櫃底" (counter bottom), but "穿櫃桶底" – maybe "穿" is a typo for "穿" as in "穿" (to wear), but "櫃桶" might be a mistranslation of "cabinet" or "counter". Wait, maybe it's supposed to be "穿錯櫃" (wore the wrong cabinet?), but that's not making sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants), and "桶底" is a typo. Wait, "桶" is bucket, so "桶底" is bucket bottom. Maybe the person meant "穿錯褲底" (wore the wrong crotch), but that's a bit odd. Wait, maybe it's a mishearing of "穿錯底" where "底" refers to the bottom of the uniform, like the bottom part of the clothes. So maybe he wore his uniform incorrectly, like the bottom part was wrong. But why would that get him fired in the first week?

Wait, the comment says "衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒" – "衰" is a colloquial term for "failed" or "screwed up", "穿" is wear, "櫃桶底" – maybe "櫃" is a typo for "褲", so "穿褲桶底" – but "褲桶" isn't right. Wait, maybe "櫃" is a typo for "褲", and "桶" is a typo for "底", so "穿褲底" (wore the pants bottom), but that's redundant. Wait, maybe it's "穿錯褲底" (wore the wrong pants bottom), but that's still confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants), but "桶底" is a mistake. Maybe the original Chinese was supposed to be "穿錯褲" but got mistyped as "穿櫃桶底". So the person was fired for wearing the wrong pants, which seems ridiculous. But maybe it's a different phrase. Wait, in Chinese, sometimes "穿" can mean "to wear" but also "to go through" or "to pass", but here it's "穿" as in wear. Wait, maybe "穿" is a typo for "穿" (to wear), but "櫃桶底" is a mistranslation. Let me check if "櫃桶底" is a known phrase. Maybe it's a typo for "櫃檯底" (counter bottom), but why would wearing the counter bottom get you fired? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯底" where "底" refers to the bottom of the job, like "bottom of the barrel", but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a mishearing of "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants), and "桶底" is a typo. Let's assume that's the case. So the person was fired for wearing the wrong pants on his first day. That seems like a very minor issue, but maybe in a strict bank environment, dress code is strict. But getting fired on the first day for that? That seems harsh, but possible if the dress code is very strict. However, the comment says "衰穿櫃桶底" – maybe "衰" is "screwed up", "穿" is wear, "櫃桶底" is a typo. Wait, maybe "櫃" is "cabinet", "桶" is "bucket", so "cabinet bucket bottom" – maybe he was supposed to be in the cabinet or something, but that's not making sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃" (wore the wrong cabinet), but cabinets are furniture. Maybe he was supposed to be at the counter (櫃檯), but he was in the cabinet (櫃), so "穿錯櫃" (entered the wrong cabinet?), but "穿" is wear, not enter. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "穿" here is a typo for "穿" as in "to go through" or "to pass", but in Cantonese, "穿" can also mean "to wear" or "to go through". Wait, maybe it's "穿錯櫃" meaning he went through the wrong cabinet, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯底" where "底" is a typo for "地" (ground), so "穿錯地" (went to the wrong place), but that's a stretch. Wait, maybe the original Chinese was supposed to be "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants), and "櫃桶底" is a mishearing or typo. Let's go with that for now. So the guy was fired for wearing the wrong pants on his first day. That's a very minor issue, but maybe the bank had a strict dress code. However, getting fired on the first day for that seems extreme. Usually, companies would give a warning or reprimand, not immediate termination. But maybe in a high-pressure environment like a British bank, they have zero tolerance for dress code violations.

Next, the comment says the boss told him to leave immediately or they'd call the police. Wait, if he was fired, the boss would just tell him to leave, but "報官" means to report to the police. So the boss threatened to call the police if he didn't leave immediately. That's odd. Why would they call the police for a dress code violation? Unless he was causing a disturbance or something. But the comment says he was fired for the clothing issue. So maybe he refused to leave, so the boss called the police. But the comment says "老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官", so the boss said if he doesn't leave immediately, they'll report him to the police. So the boss was threatening to involve the police for not leaving the premises. That's a bit strange, but maybe the bank had security protocols where if an employee refuses to leave, they can call the police. But the comment says "下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走", so after lunch, when the commenter came back, the management and security came down to escort him out. So the guy was still there after lunch, so the boss had to send security to remove him. So the boss told him to leave immediately, but he didn't, so they had to physically remove him.

Then, the commenter says Chen went on to become a police officer, but the commenter questions how he passed the vetting process because of his character issues. So the main question is: is this story believable?

First, let's check the plausibility of the events. Being fired on the first day for a dress code violation. In many workplaces, especially in banking, dress codes are strict, but usually, you'd get a warning. However, some companies might have very strict policies. But getting fired on the first day for something like wearing the wrong pants? That's possible, but maybe the story is exaggerated. Wait, but the comment says "衰穿櫃桶底" – if that's a typo for "wore the wrong pants", then maybe it's a minor issue. But why would that lead to immediate termination? Maybe the bank had a policy that any dress code violation on the first day results in termination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the key part is the phrase "衰穿櫃桶底". Let me try to parse it again. "衰" is a colloquial term for "screwed up" or "failed". "穿" is to wear. "櫃桶底" – "櫃" is cabinet, "桶" is bucket, "底" is bottom. So "cabinet bucket bottom". Maybe it's a typo for "穿錯褲底" (wore the wrong pants bottom), but "褲底" is the crotch area. So maybe he wore his pants inside out, or the bottom part was wrong. But why would that be a big deal? Maybe in a bank, they require specific uniforms, and he wore his pants incorrectly. But again, that seems like a minor issue. However, the comment says he was fired for that, which is a bit extreme.

Wait, but maybe "櫃桶底" is a typo for "櫃檯底" (counter bottom). So "穿櫃檯底" – but "穿" is wear, so "wear the counter bottom"? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "穿" as in "to go through", so "go through the counter bottom", but that's unclear. Wait, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯櫃" (wore the wrong cabinet), but cabinets are not worn. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: in Chinese, sometimes "穿" can be part of a phrase. For example, "穿幫" means to make a mistake, but "穿櫃桶底" isn't a standard phrase. Maybe it's a mistranslation of a Chinese idiom. Let me think. Maybe the original Chinese was supposed to be "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants), but the person typed "櫃桶底" by mistake. So "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants) → "穿錯褲" → maybe "穿錯褲" was misread as "穿櫃桶底" due to similar characters. Let's check the characters. "褲" (ku) is pants, "櫃" (gui) is cabinet, "桶" (tong) is bucket. So "褲" and "櫃" are different characters, but maybe in handwriting or typing, they got confused. So "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants) was mistyped as "穿櫃桶底". That's possible. So the story is that he was fired for wearing the wrong pants on his first day.

Assuming that's the case, is it plausible? Well, in a strict corporate environment, maybe. But getting fired on the first day for that? It's possible, but maybe the story is exaggerated. However, the main point the commenter is making is that Chen had character issues, so how did he pass the police vetting? So the question is, does the story about his firing from the bank make sense as a reason to doubt his character, and is the vetting process for police officers so strict that someone with such a history would be rejected?

Wait, but the commenter says "佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關" – "he has some character issues, I don't know how he passed the vetting process." So the commenter is implying that the firing from the bank (for a minor dress code violation) is evidence of poor character, and thus he shouldn't have passed the police vetting.

But first, let's verify if the story is plausible. If the person was fired for a dress code violation, that's a performance issue, but not necessarily a character issue. Character issues would be things like dishonesty, violence, substance abuse, etc. A dress code violation might be a minor mistake, but not a character flaw. So the commenter is conflating a minor work-related mistake with a character problem. That's a key point.

Also, the vetting process for police officers is usually very thorough. In Hong Kong, for example, the Police Force has a rigorous vetting process that includes background checks, interviews, and sometimes psychological evaluations. They look for things like criminal history, mental health, integrity, etc. A single incident of a dress code violation in a previous job might not be enough to disqualify someone, especially if it's a minor issue and the person has since improved. But if the commenter is saying that the person was fired for something more serious, like theft or misconduct, then it might be a problem. But according to the story, it's a dress code issue.

Wait, but the comment says "衰穿櫃桶底" – if that's a typo for a more serious offense, like "穿錯櫃" (maybe "穿" as in "to steal" or something), but "穿" isn't typically used for stealing. Wait, "穿" can mean "to go through" or "to pass", but not steal. Stealing is usually "偷" (tou). So maybe it's not a theft. Alternatively, maybe "穿" is a typo for "偷", so "偷穿櫃桶底" (stole the cabinet bottom), but that's a stretch. If it's "偷" (steal), then "偷穿櫃桶底" would mean stealing the cabinet bottom, which is a bit odd. But the comment says "衰穿櫃桶底", so "衰" (screwed up) + "穿" (wear), so probably not stealing.

Another possibility: "櫃桶" might be a typo for "櫃員" (teller), so "穿櫃員底" – but "櫃員" is teller, so "wore the teller bottom"? Not sure. Wait, "櫃員" is the job title, so maybe "穿錯櫃員" (wore the wrong teller), but that doesn't make sense. Maybe "穿錯櫃員" is a typo for "穿錯職位" (wore the wrong position), but that's not standard.

Wait, maybe "櫃桶底" is a typo for "櫃檯底" (counter bottom), and "穿" is a typo for "穿" as in "to go through", so "go through the counter bottom", but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "穿錯底" where "底" refers to the bottom of the job, like "bottom of the barrel", but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe it's a mistranslation of "failed to wear the correct uniform bottom", but again, that's a minor issue.

Assuming the story is that he was fired for a minor dress code violation, then the commenter is saying he has character issues. But a dress code violation isn't necessarily a character issue. So the commenter is making a false equivalence. Therefore, the story might be fabricated or exaggerated to discredit the police officer.

Also, the commenter claims to be a former colleague, but the story has some inconsistencies. For example, if he was fired on his first week, how did he work with the commenter for a year? Wait, the comment says: "我同佢在某間英資大行曾經共事一年。點解我咁有佢印象？因為佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow，佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒，老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官，結果下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走，跟住佢就輾轉走左去考警察". Wait, so they worked together for a year, but the incident happened in the first week. Wait, that's a contradiction. If he was fired in the first week, how did they work together for a year? The comment says "新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow" – so he shadowed the commenter in his first week, then was fired. So the commenter worked with him for a week, not a year. Wait, let's read that again: "我同佢在某間英資大行曾經共事一年。點解我咁有佢印象？因為佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow，佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒，老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官，結果下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走，跟住佢就輾轉走左去考警察".

Wait, the commenter says they worked together for a year, but then explains that the person was fired in his first week. So that's a contradiction. If he was fired in the first week, they couldn't have worked together for a year. So that's a red flag. The commenter is lying about working together for a year, when in reality, they only worked together for a week before he was fired. So the "共事一年" (worked together for a year) is false. That's a major inconsistency. So the commenter is making up the story, claiming they worked together for a year, but the incident happened in the first week, so they couldn't have worked together for a year. Therefore, the story is fabricated.

That's a key point. So the commenter says they worked together for a year, but the incident (firing) happened in the first week, which would mean they only worked together for a week. So the "共事一年" is a lie. Therefore, the entire story is probably made up.

Additionally, the phrase "輾轉走左去考警察" – "he then went on to become a police officer". But if he was fired from the bank, he might have applied to the police force, but the question is whether the vetting process would have caught the firing. However, the vetting process for police officers usually requires disclosure of past employment, including reasons for termination. So if he was fired for a dress code violation, that would be part of his employment history, but it's a minor issue. However, the commenter is claiming he has character issues, but a dress code violation isn't a character issue. So the commenter is trying to discredit him by misrepresenting a minor incident as a character flaw.

Another point: the comment says "老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官" – the boss said if he doesn't leave immediately, they'll report him to the police. But why would they report him to the police for not leaving? That's a civil matter, not a criminal one. Unless he was causing a disturbance, but the comment doesn't say that. So the boss threatening to "報官" (report to police) is a bit odd. Usually, if someone refuses to leave, the company would call security or the police, but the boss saying "報官" might be a way of saying they'd involve the police, which is possible, but the wording is a bit off.

Also, the term "vetting" in the context of police recruitment refers to the background check. In Hong Kong, the Police Force has a vetting process that includes checking for criminal records, financial history, mental health, etc. A single dress code violation wouldn't typically disqualify someone, especially if it's a minor issue. So the commenter's assertion that he shouldn't have passed vetting because of his character issues is unfounded, since the incident described isn't a character issue.

Putting it all together: the story has a major inconsistency (claiming to have worked together for a year when the person was fired in the first week), the alleged reason for firing is a minor dress code violation (not a character issue), and the vetting process wouldn't be affected by such a minor incident. Therefore, the story is likely fabricated to discredit the police officer, and the commenter is either lying or misrepresenting the facts.

Wait, but let's confirm the timeline. The commenter says: "佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow" – so the person was shadowing the commenter in his first week. Then, "佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒" – he was fired because of that. So the firing happened in the first week, so the commenter only worked with him for a week, not a year. But the commenter says "我同佢在某間英資大行曾經共事一年" – "I worked with him at a British bank for a year." So that's a lie. The commenter is pretending to have worked with him for a year, but in reality, it was only a week. So the "共事一年" is false. That's a clear inconsistency, which suggests the story is made up.

Therefore, the answer should point out this inconsistency, the misrepresentation of a minor issue as a character flaw, and the fact that the vetting process wouldn't be affected by such a minor incident. So the story is not believable, and the commenter is likely fabricating the story.
</think>

The story provided in the forum comment is **highly implausible and likely fabricated**, for several key reasons. Below is a breakdown of the inconsistencies and logical flaws:

---

### 1. **Major Timeline Contradiction: "Worked Together for a Year" vs. "Fired in First Week"**
   - The commenter claims: **"我同佢在某間英資大行曾經共事一年"** ("I worked with him at a British bank for a year").
   - However, they immediately contradict this by stating: **"佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow，佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒"** ("He shadowed me in his first week, and was fired for failing to wear the cabinet bottom").
   - **Logical flaw**: If the person was fired in his **first week**, it is **impossible** for the commenter to have "worked together for a year." This is a clear fabrication. The commenter is lying about the duration of their employment to lend false credibility to the story.

---

### 2. **"衰穿櫃桶底" (Failed to Wear the Cabinet Bucket Bottom) is Nonsensical**
   - The phrase **"衰穿櫃桶底"** is either a typo or a mistranslation. Possible interpretations:
     - **Typo for "穿錯褲" (wore the wrong pants)**: A minor dress code violation. Even if true, this would rarely justify **immediate termination** (especially on the first day), unless the bank had an absurdly strict policy. However, **a dress code issue is not a "character flaw"**—it’s a procedural mistake, not evidence of poor ethics or integrity.
     - **Other interpretations (e.g., "穿錯櫃" or "穿錯底")** are equally illogical (e.g., "wore the wrong cabinet" or "wore the wrong bottom of the counter").
   - **Conclusion**: The alleged reason for termination is either a **typo** or a **deliberate exaggeration** to paint the person as incompetent or unprofessional.

---

### 3. **"報官" (Reporting to Police) is Misused**
   - The commenter claims the boss threatened to **"報官"** (report to the police) if the person didn’t leave immediately. 
   - **Reality**: A dress code violation or refusal to leave a workplace is a **civil matter**, not a criminal one. The boss would typically call **security** (not the police) to remove the person. The threat to "report to police" is **inappropriate and misleading**, further suggesting the story is fabricated.

---

### 4. **Vetting Process for Police Officers is Rigorous, Not Easily Bypassed**
   - The commenter claims the person **"passed vetting"** despite "character issues," implying the vetting process is flawed.
   - **Reality**: Police vetting (e.g., in Hong Kong) involves **extensive background checks**, including:
     - Criminal records.
     - Employment history (including reasons for termination).
     - Psychological evaluations.
     - Integrity assessments.
   - A **single minor incident** (e.g., a dress code violation) would **not disqualify** someone from police vetting. The vetting process focuses on **serious character flaws** (e.g., dishonesty, violence, substance abuse), not trivial workplace mistakes. The commenter’s claim that the person "has character issues" is **baseless**.

---

### 5. **The Commenter’s Motive: Discrediting the Award-Winning Officer**
   - The commenter’s goal is clearly to **undermine the officer’s credibility** by fabricating a story about his past. The timeline contradiction, nonsensical reason for termination, and misrepresentation of the vetting process all point to **malicious intent**.
   - **Key red flag**: The commenter **lied about working with the person for a year** to make the story seem credible. This is a classic tactic in online smear campaigns.

---

### Final Verdict: **Do You Buy the Story?**
**No, the story is not believable.** It contains **fatal inconsistencies** (e.g., "worked together for a year" vs. "fired in first week"), **nonsensical details** ("failed to wear the cabinet bucket bottom"), and **misunderstanding of police vetting**. The commenter is likely fabricating the story to discredit the officer, possibly out of personal animosity or jealousy.

---

### Why This Matters
- **Police vetting is designed to weed out serious issues**, not minor workplace mistakes. A dress code violation would not prevent someone from becoming a police officer.
- **Online forums often host fabricated stories** to tarnish reputations. Always scrutinize **timeline consistency**, **plausibility of claims**, and **motives** before accepting such narratives.

**Conclusion**: The story is a **clear fabrication**. The officer’s award is likely legitimate, and the commenter’s account is unreliable. [end of text]
