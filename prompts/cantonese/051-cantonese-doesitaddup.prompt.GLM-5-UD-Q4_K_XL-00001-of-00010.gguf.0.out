I would approach this story with **significant skepticism**. While it is impossible to verify the truth without concrete evidence, there are several logical inconsistencies, legal implausibilities, and common internet tropes in the comment that suggest it is likely fabricated or heavily exaggerated.

Here is a breakdown of why I do not "buy" the story:

### 1. The "Immediate Resignation vs. Police Report" Contradiction
The commenter claims the boss said: *"If you don't leave immediately, we will call the police."*

This is a classic plot device in movies, but it makes little sense in a professional banking context, especially regarding theft ("穿櫃桶底").
*   **Banking Policy:** Banks have strict compliance and audit protocols. If an employee steals money, the bank does not typically offer them a deal to "resign immediately and we forget about it." Letting a thief walk away destroys the evidence chain and leaves the bank liable.
*   **The Logical Flaw:** If the evidence was strong enough to fire him and threaten to call the police, the bank would likely suspend him immediately, launch an investigation, and potentially call the police to recover the funds. They would not give him a "head start" to escape just to avoid a scene.

### 2. The Vetting Process (The "Vetting" Claim)
The commenter questions how the individual passed police vetting given his history.
*   **Hong Kong Police Vetting:** The vetting process for the Hong Kong Police Force is notoriously rigorous. It includes deep background checks, financial background checks, and contacting previous employers.
*   **The "Blacklist":** If the individual was indeed caught stealing ("穿櫃桶底") and was fired from a major bank ("英資大行"), he would likely have a permanent adverse record in the banking industry (e.g., a note in a shared database) or a police record if a report was filed.
*   **The Discrepancy:** If the bank actually caught him stealing but chose *not* to report it to the police (to protect their reputation or avoid hassle), then there would be no criminal record. However, during police vetting, candidates must declare if they have ever been dismissed or asked to resign. If he lied, the background check often uncovers this. If he told the truth, the police would likely reject a candidate fired for dishonesty.
*   **Conclusion:** The fact that he passed vetting suggests either:
    a) The stealing incident never happened.
    b) It happened but was not recorded/disclosed in a way the police could find (making the commenter's claim of "obvious guilt" questionable).
    c) The police vetting failed, which is unlikely for a high-profile recruitment.

### 3. The "Shadowing" Detail (Too Convenient)
The commenter claims to remember this specific person from "one year" of working together because the person shadowed him in the *first week*.
*   **Memory Bias:** In a large "British bank" (英資大行), turnover is high. Remembering a specific colleague you only worked with for one week, one year ago, in vivid detail (including the specific threat made by the boss) is statistically unlikely unless the event was traumatic or highly publicized.
*   **The "Tell":** This detail feels inserted to give the commenter false credibility ("I was there!"). In reality, if someone shadowed you for a week and then disappeared, you would likely forget them within a month unless the incident was office gossip legend.

### 4. Motive and Anonymity
This is a classic case of **"Tall Poppy Syndrome"** or online defamation.
*   **Context:** The target is an "Outstanding Police Cadet" (優秀學警). This is a public honor.
*   **Human Psychology:** When someone achieves public success, jealous parties or internet trolls often appear to "expose" them to ruin their moment. The lack of evidence ("Trust me, I was there") combined with a serious accusation (theft) is a hallmark of online defamation.
*   **Specific Terminology:** The use of the term "穿櫃桶底" (stealing from the employer/til) is a very specific, dramatic Cantonese slang often used in TV dramas.

### Verdict
**I do not buy the story.**

The narrative relies on a "movie-logic" version of corporate discipline (threatening to call the police but letting the thief walk away) and ignores the reality of police background checks. It is highly probable that this is a fabricated story by an internet troll aiming to discredit the award recipient. If the accusation were true, the bank's compliance department and the police vetting unit would have likely prevented this outcome long before any award was given. [end of text]
