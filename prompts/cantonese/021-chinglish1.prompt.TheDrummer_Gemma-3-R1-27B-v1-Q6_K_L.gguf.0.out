Okay, here are the translations of the Chinglish phrases into Cantonese, with explanations where necessary.  I'll try to capture the nuance and common usage as understood in Hong Kong Cantonese.  Note that some phrases are *very* colloquial and might have slight variations depending on the speaker.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Tone Marks:** I'll use Jyutping (Cantonese Romanization) with tone marks for clarity.  However, in actual spoken Cantonese, tones are crucial and often not written.
*   **Colloquialisms:** Chinglish often relies on very specific, informal Cantonese particles and phrasing. I'll try to preserve that.
*   **Code-Mixing:**  I'll indicate where English words are integrated into the Cantonese structure.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context:**  Chinglish is *highly* context-dependent. The same phrase can have slightly different meanings depending on the situation and the speaker's intent.
*   **Regional Variations:** While this is based on Hong Kong Cantonese, there might be slight differences in phrasing in other Cantonese-speaking regions.
*   **Evolution:** Chinglish itself has evolved over time. Some phrases might be more common among older generations.

I hope these translations are helpful!  Let me know if you have any other Chinglish phrases you'd like me to translate. [end of text]
