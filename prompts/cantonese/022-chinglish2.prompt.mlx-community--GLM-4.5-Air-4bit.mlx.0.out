Here's the conversation translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**  
Hah.  
Yeah, me too.  
I like to play very much, gah.  
But I never gamble, lor.  
:)  

**Bob:**  
Oh, I never gamble on Big 2 either.  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, what happened?  

**Bob:**  
Went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big 2, wor.  
So I said, let's play, lor.  
Then he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well).  
So I replied, "so hing" la... Besides, at most lose something like $10, jeh...  

**Alice:**  
So it's okay, then.  
:)  
Hehe. You're the type who doesn't really care about winning or losing, right?  
It's good actually. But if I were to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly, lor.  

**Bob:**  
But it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...  
Btw, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
What program?  
More like, do you need to download it or something?  
:)  

**Bob:**  
Well, if you play online, of course you need to have a program to play, la.  
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... Wait...  

**Alice:**  
How come?  
:)  
No problem.  
Hehe

### Notes on Translation:
- **"gah," "lor," "wor," "jeh," "la"** are Cantonese particles that add tone or emphasis. In English, they're often omitted or reflected in phrasing (e.g., "then," "though," "you know").
- **"so hing"** is a Cantonese phrase meaning "so what?" or "who cares?"  
- **"stand so hard"** is a colloquial way of saying "being too stubborn" or "insisting too much."  
- **"meh program"** → "What program?" (expressing confusion).  
- **"ng goi sai"** → "No problem." (Cantonese expression of reassurance).  
- **"lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai"** → "You're the type who doesn't really care about winning or losing, right?" (This is a rough interpretation of the Cantonese sentiment).  

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
