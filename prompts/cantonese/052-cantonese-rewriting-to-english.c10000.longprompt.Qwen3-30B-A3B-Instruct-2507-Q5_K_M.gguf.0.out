Three hours after finishing work and returning home, I went online and saw people mourning #Yu Ying-shih. At that moment, I only knew he was a hero of Professor #Wong Wai-hung, a blogger I follow—nothing more about his life.

But in the 21st century, you don’t need to ask teachers for everything; Google knows all. After a quick search, I began to understand why he was so famous, and why Professor Wong kept bringing him up.

Yu Ying-shih had taught at three Ivy League universities! That’s impressive, isn’t it? Just the name alone is enough to make people nervous!

I became obsessed, digging into every detail about Yu Ying-shih: how he was portrayed in Chinese Wikipedia, how he was described in English Wikipedia, how people praised him when he won awards, and how obituaries today speak of him. In my mind, a figure emerged—one I deeply respect: Teacher Yun-Gen. They’re almost identical!

The only difference? Teacher Yun-Gen never held a professorship at Harvard. But their mastery of classical Chinese scholarship—#erudite and #rooted_in_Chinese_culture—is clearly the same. Yun-Gen loved Daoism and Buddhism; Yu Ying-shih, it seems, was a devoted follower of Confucianism.

But that’s where the problem lies.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, wisdom, faithfulness, hierarchical order, and the proper roles of ruler and subject. Yet if you’re a scholar at an elite American university, having earned your PhD during the height of the hippie movement, would you really be teaching people to #respect_authority and reject #individualism? That would be absurd.

So how do scholars avoid sounding ridiculous? That’s precisely what Confucius spent his life learning—the hard way. In Confucius’s time, the world was falling into chaos. He traveled from state to state, hoping to secure a position to implement his vision. But he only knew how to recite ancient texts and preach Zhou rituals; he failed to adapt to the needs of rulers. He returned empty-handed. Yet failure is the mother of success. His students learned much faster.

As Sima Qian wrote: “The seventy disciples scattered to serve various states—some became teachers and high ministers, others advised scholars and officials.” Why?

Because over generations, they learned to read the mood of the rulers. By Mencius’s time, interactions with kings had changed. Mencius could joke with them, flatter them: “Your Majesty, you can’t bear to see a cow slaughtered—surely you’re a humane ruler! If you practice the Way of the King, you’ll succeed!”

By the end of the Warring States period, Confucian advisors had become masters of the “king interview” game. To get appointed, they abandoned “benevolence” and “ritual”—they turned to “legalism,” the new technology of governance. So even though Xunzi was a Confucian, his students rose to high office in the Qin dynasty. Look at Li Si—there’s not a trace of Confucius in him.

Today, the United Nations has over two hundred member states. The global situation is far more complex than in the Spring and Autumn era. When Confucian scholars leave China—the ancient land of ritual—and go to America, a military superpower, do they really pull out the *Analects* and demand people observe a three-year mourning period? Confucius himself was turned away from door after door. Everyone knows that story. So in America, Confucian disciples naturally claim that Confucius supported #democracy, that #democracy is supreme, and that communism must be overthrown—only then can one become a professor at an Ivy League school.

Someone might ask: “But isn’t there any consequence?” Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago. The Confucian tradition was shattered during the #May-Fourth Movement. As the sole superpower after WWII, America’s top academic institutions have the authority to shape discourse. You think Johnny Kung could teach people to use drugs and sleep with women, and some would still believe him? After all, America’s #theoretical_nukes are real. The consequences of doubting them are still fresh in everyone’s memory.

So why could Yu Ying-shih, back in the day, just pick a few lines from the *Book of Han*, translate them into English, and earn a PhD—and then be hired by multiple universities? #You_know_why. They elevated him to the status of authority so he could speak with absolute conviction: “All of you here are just ducks—do you really think Confucius’s ideas are feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, he was a true democrat! Since you don’t have a Buddhist chair, just shut up and listen!”

As for whether Confucianism conflicts with democracy—let’s be honest, “Sinologists” don’t really know. Take the Republic of China as an example. Hey, is Taiwan’s political system really “Confucian”? The Kuomintang leaders curse蔡英文 every day—does that sound like Confucianism? Did蔡英文 ever perform elaborate rituals to heaven and earth? No, she didn’t. She embraces science, not superstition—clearly contrary to Confucian ideals. Do you think using Chinese characters makes you Confucian? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

As I’ve said before, Japan is Confucian. Britain is Confucian (at least among advanced nations, it’s the closest). The monarch is ceremonial, power is divinely ordained, supreme and untouchable. Society is strictly hierarchical—no one dares challenge their superiors. That’s how stability is maintained. As for whether Britain’s democracy succeeds or fails—well, that’s not something a Chinese-American academic has the right to judge.

**Comment:**

Disregarding the essay’s biting sarcasm, irony, and provocative tone, the central argument the author is making is this: **Confucianism, as a philosophical and ethical tradition, is deeply rooted in hierarchical, authoritarian, and ritualistic social structures that are fundamentally incompatible with modern liberal democracy.** The author argues that when Confucian scholars—especially those in Western academic institutions—claim that Confucius was a democrat or that Confucian thought supports democracy, they are not engaging in honest scholarship but rather **reinterpreting tradition to fit contemporary political agendas**, particularly those aligned with Western liberal values.

The author uses Yu Ying-shih as a case study to illustrate how academic prestige and institutional power can be used to **repackage Confucianism into a form that is palatable to Western audiences**, even if it distorts or erases its original meaning. The deeper point is that **cultural traditions should not be selectively adapted or misrepresented to serve ideological or institutional interests**, especially when doing so risks undermining the integrity of both the tradition and the academic enterprise.

Ultimately, the author is warning against **cultural appropriation and intellectual dishonesty in the global academic discourse**, where Eastern philosophies are reshaped to fit Western political narratives—often at the expense of historical accuracy and philosophical authenticity. [end of text]
