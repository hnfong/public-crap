A skeptical post about a decorated policeman's past! Let's break down the elements to assess the credibility of the story. I'll provide an analysis, but ultimately, without more evidence or verification, it's challenging to definitively "buy" or "not buy" the story entirely. Here's why:

### **Elements of the Story and Their Credibility Indicators**

1. **Claim of Shared Workplace (某間英資大行)**
   - **Credibility Indicator: Medium**
   - **Reason:** Easy to claim, hard to verify without more specifics. The existence of a large British-owned bank where both parties worked is plausible but lacks concrete details for confirmation.

2. **Shadowing for a Week**
   - **Credibility Indicator: Medium**
   - **Reason:** A common practice in many industries for new hires, so it's plausible. However, without the policeman's confirmation, it remains unverified.

3. **Reason for Termination (衰穿櫃桶底)**
   - **Credibility Indicator: Low to Medium**
   - **Reason:** The specificity of the reason ("wearing through the sole of his shoes" implying laziness or not being diligent enough, as "衰穿櫃桶底" is a colloquialism suggesting someone is so lazy they wear out their shoes just standing still, possibly at a desk job) is unusual and somewhat humorous, which could make it more memorable and thus possibly true. However, it's an unconventional reason for termination, especially to the point of being escorted out and threatened with legal action.

4. **Threat of Legal Action and Immediate Escort by Security**
   - **Credibility Indicator: Low**
   - **Reason:** The escalation to threatening legal action for not leaving immediately and being escorted out by security for such a reason seems disproportionate. More common for HR to handle with a formal termination process.

5. **Transition to Becoming a Policeman Despite Alleged Issues**
   - **Credibility Indicator: Medium to Low**
   - **Reason:** The skepticism here lies in the claimed ease of overcoming vetting with alleged significant past issues. Police vetting processes are typically rigorous, but not foolproof. It's possible, though surprising, if the past issues were not properly documented or disclosed.

### **Overall Assessment: Credibility of the Story**

- **Overall Credibility Indicator: Low to Medium**

### **Why Not Entirely Disbelievable:**

- **Specificity:** The story contains specific, albeit unusual, details which can be a hallmark of truthful accounts (people often add implausible details to lies, but very specific, peculiar details might suggest truth).
- **Motivation:** The poster doesn't seem to be seeking immediate gain or widespread attention (since it's a forum comment), though there could be personal motives (e.g., sour grapes) not immediately apparent.

### **Why Skeptical:**

- **Unconventional Reason for Termination and Extreme Response**
- **Lack of Verification from Other Sources**
- **The Significant Leap to Overcoming Vetting for a Police Role**

### **Do I "Buy" the Story?

- **Partially:** The core of the story (shared workplace, transition to police) might be true.
- **Doubtful Aspects:** The reasons for termination and the manner of leaving seem exaggerated or inaccurate.

### **To Increase Credibility of the Claim:**

- **Corroboration from Other Colleagues**
- **Documentation or News Articles About the Incident (Unlikely for a non-public termination)**
- **Response or Confirmation from the Policeman in Question** [end of text]
