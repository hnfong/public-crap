Okay, let's tackle this Chinglish to Cantonese translation task. The user provided 10 phrases that are written in a Cantonese pronunciation using English letters (Chinglish), and I need to convert them into proper written Cantonese. 

First, I need to recall that Chinglish here refers to Cantonese words spelled out phonetically with English letters, often non-standard. So each phrase is a Cantonese sentence written in a way that approximates the sounds using English spelling. My job is to figure out what the actual Cantonese characters are.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"

Breaking it down:
- "gor doe" – probably "個度" (go3 dou6), meaning "here" or "this place".
- "yau" – likely "有" (jau5), meaning "have".
- "gor bin" – "個便" (go3 bin6)? Wait, maybe "個pen" but "bin" could be "便" (bin6) but not sure. Alternatively, "bin" might be "片" (pin3), but "gor bin" could be "個片" (go3 pin3), meaning "a clip" or "a piece".
- "tai lo" – "睇路" (tai3 lou6), meaning "watch the road" or "be careful".
- "ah" – sentence ending particle.

Wait, "tai lo" is "睇路", which is a common phrase. So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" might be "個度有個片睇路呀？" But "bin" as "片" (pin3) makes sense. So "個度有個片睇路呀？" translates to "Is there a clip to watch the road here?" But maybe "bin" is "便" (bin6), but "個便" doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, "bin" could be "邊" (bin1), but "gor bin" would be "個邊" (which side). Wait, "yau gor bin" could be "有個邊" (jau5 go3 bin1), meaning "which side". But "tai lo" is "睇路". Hmm.

Wait, maybe "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" is "個度有個便睇路呀？" But "便" here might not fit. Alternatively, "bin" could be "片" (pin3), so "有個片睇路". Maybe it's "有個片睇路呀？" meaning "Is there a video clip to watch the road?" But "tai lo" is "睇路", which is "watch the road", so maybe the phrase is "個度有個片睇路呀？" which would be "Is there a clip (video) to watch the road here?"

Wait, but "tai lo" is "睇路", so "bin tai lo" might be "片睇路", but that doesn't make sense. Maybe "bin" is part of another word. Let me think again.

Alternatively, "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" – maybe "個度有個bin睇路呀？" Maybe "bin" is "便" as in "方便" (fong1 bin6), but that's two syllables. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "bin" is "邊" (bin1), so "yau gor bin" = "有個邊" (which side). So "個度有個邊睇路呀？" which would be "Which side here should I watch the road?" But that doesn't make much sense. Maybe "tai lo" is not "睇路" but something else. Wait, "tai" could be "大" (daai6), but "lo" is unclear.

Wait, perhaps "tai lo" is "太老" (taai3 lou5), but that means "too old". Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "tai lo" is "太啰" as in "太啰嗦", but not sure.

Wait, let's try to parse each part phonetically.

"gor doe" – go3 dou6 (個度)

"yau" – jau5 (有)

"gor bin" – go3 bin1 (個邊) – "which side"

"tai lo" – tai3 lou6 (睇路)

"ah" – aa3 (呀)

So putting it together: "個度有個邊睇路呀？" But "有個邊睇路" doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's "個度有冇邊睇路呀？" but the original says "yau", which is "有", not "yau moe" (有冇). Wait, the example given was "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" which translates to "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？", so "yau moe" is "有冇". Here it's "yau", so just "有".

Wait, maybe "gor bin" is "個pen", but in Cantonese, "pen" isn't a word. Alternatively, "bin" could be "便" (bin6), but "個便" isn't standard. Maybe it's "個片" (go3 pin3), "a clip". So "個度有個片睇路呀？" meaning "Is there a clip (video) to watch the road here?" But "睇路" is "watch the road", so maybe it's "Is there a video clip showing the road here?"

Alternatively, maybe "tai lo" is "太老", but that seems less likely.

Wait, another angle: "tai lo" could be "太啰", but "lo" as a particle. Maybe "tai" is "大" (daai6), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "bin tai lo" is "片睇路", but "片" is "pin3", so "bin" might be a misspelling of "pin". So "gor bin" = "個片", so "個度有個片睇路呀？" which would be "Is there a clip (video) to watch the road here?"

I think that's the most plausible. So translation: 個度有個片睇路呀？

But let's check the example given: "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" becomes "你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？". So "tai sing con" is "睇歌唱比賽". So "tai" is "睇", "sing" is "唱", "con" is "比賽".

So in phrase 1, "tai lo" would be "睇路", which is a common phrase meaning "watch the road" or "be careful". So "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" is "個度有個邊睇路呀？" Wait, but "bin" as "邊" (bin1). So "yau gor bin" = 有個邊, which would be "which side". So the sentence is "個度有個邊睇路呀？" which translates to "Which side here do I watch the road?" But that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's "Is there a way to watch the road here?" Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe "bin" is "便" (bin6), as in "方便", but "個便" isn't standard. Maybe it's a typo for "m bin" (點), but not sure.

Wait, perhaps "gor bin" is "個pen", but in Cantonese, "pen" isn't a word. Maybe it's "個pen" as in "pen" from English, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, "bin" could be "片" (pin3), so "個片" (go3 pin3), meaning "a clip" or "a piece". So "個度有個片睇路呀？" which would be "Is there a video clip to watch the road here?" That makes sense. So the translation would be 個度有個片睇路呀？

But let's check the tones. "Pin" in Cantonese is pin3, so "bin" might be a misspelling where 'p' is written as 'b', which is common in informal romanization. So "bin" = "pin". So "gor bin" = "個片".

Yes, that seems right. So 1. 個度有個片睇路呀？

Moving to 2. "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?"

Breaking it down:

"ngor ng" – probably "我" (ngo5) but written as "ngor", and "ng" might be "人" (jan4), but "ngor ng" could be "我人" (ngo5 jan4), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe "ngor" is "我" (ngo5), and "ng" is "仍" (jing4), but not sure.

Wait, "ngor ng" – maybe "我" (ngo5) and "仍" (jing4), but "ngor ng" could be "我仍", but the phrase starts with "ngor ng sik...".

Alternatively, "ngor" might be "我" (ngo5), and "ng" could be a typo for "still" but in Cantonese.

Wait, let's look at the structure. The example had "nei yau moe..." which is "you have not...". So "ngor" is likely "我" (ngo5). "ng" might be "仍" (jing4), but "ngor ng" could be "我仍", but let's see the whole phrase.

"use fai zi gah" – "use" might be "又" (jau6), "fai" could be "飛" (fei1), "zi" might be "紙" (zi2), "gah" could be "架" (gaa3).

"use chi gang duck ng duck" – "use" again "又", "chi" might be "遲" (ci4), "gang" could be "咁" (gam3), "duck" might be "得" (dak1), "ng" again, "duck".

Wait, let's try:

"ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" – 我仍識又飛紙架？

Not sure. Alternatively, "ngor" = 我 (ngo5), "ng" = 仍 (jing4), "sik" = 識 (sik1), "use" = 又 (jau6), "fai" = 飛 (fei1), "zi" = 紙 (zi2), "gah" = 架 (gaa3).

So "我仍識又飛紙架" – but "又飛紙架" doesn't make sense. Maybe "fai zi" is "飛紙" (fei1 zi2), which is "airmail letter", but "gah" as "架" (gaa3) is a classifier.

Alternatively, "fai zi" could be "廢紙" (fai3 zi2), meaning "waste paper". Oh! "fai" as "廢" (fai3). So "use fai zi gah" = 又廢紙架.

So "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" = 我仍識又廢紙架？

Wait, "ngor ng" might be "我人" but that's not right. Maybe "ngor" is "我" (ngo5), "ng" is a typo for "都" (dou1), but written as "ng" due to keyboard layout? Wait, on a QWERTY keyboard, 'd' is next to 's', but maybe not.

Alternatively, "ngor ng" could be "我仍" (ngo5 jing4), meaning "I still".

"sik" = 識 (sik1), "use" = 又 (jau6), "fai zi" = 廢紙 (fai3 zi2), "gah" = 架 (gaa3).

So "我仍識又廢紙架" – but "又廢紙架" is unclear. Maybe "gah" is "嚇" (haa3), but spelled as "gah".

Wait, the second part: "use chi gang duck ng duck" – 又遲咁得仍得？

"chi" = 遲 (ci4), "gang" = 咁 (gam3), "duck" = 得 (dak1), "ng" = 仍 (jing4), "duck" = 得 (dak1).

So "又遲咁得仍得？" which would be "又遲咁得仍然得？" but that doesn't make sense. Maybe "duck ng duck" is "得咗得" (dak1 zo2 dak1), but not sure.

Wait, perhaps "duck" is "到" (dou3), but spelled as "duck".

Alternatively, "duck" could be "督" but not sure.

Wait, let's think of common phrases. The example had "tai sing con" for "睇歌唱比賽". So "duck" might be "到" (dou3), but "duck" is closer to "dak" (得).

Wait, "use chi gang duck ng duck" – 又遲咁得仍得？

Maybe it's "又遲咁都冇得？" but the original has "duck ng duck".

Alternatively, "duck" is "得" (dak1), so "又遲咁得仍得？" which might be "又遲咁都冇得？" but not matching.

Wait, maybe "ng" here is "唔" (m4), but written as "ng" due to similar sound. In some romanizations, "m" is written as "ng", but usually "m" is "唔".

Wait, the example had "yau moe" for "有冇", so "moe" is "冇". So "ng" might not be "唔".

Alternatively, "ng" could be "我" but that's "ngo".

This is tricky. Let's try another approach.

The whole phrase: "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?"

Maybe "ngor" = 我 (ngo5), "ng" = 仍 (jing4), "sik" = 識 (sik1), "use" = 又 (jau6), "fai zi" = 廢紙 (fai3 zi2), "gah" = 嗎 (maa3) but spelled as "gah".

Wait, "gah" could be "嚇" (haa3), but "廢紙嚇" doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, "gah" is "架" (gaa3), a classifier.

So "我仍識又廢紙架，又遲咁得仍得？"

Not making sense. Maybe "fai zi" is "飛機" (fei1 gei1), but "zi" is "機" (gei1), but spelled as "zi".

Wait, "fai zi" – if "zi" is "機", but "機" is "gei", so maybe not.

Alternatively, "fai" is "快" (faai3), but "快" is faai3.

Wait, perhaps "sik use fai zi gah" is "識又快遲架", but not sure.

Alternatively, "ngor ng sik" = 我仍然識 (I still know), "use fai zi gah" = 又廢時架 (again wasting time).

"廢時" (fai3 si4) means wasting time. So "fai" = 廢, "zi" = 時 (si4), but "zi" is usually "si" in romanization. Maybe a misspelling.

So "ngor ng sik use fai si gah" but written as "zi" instead of "si".

So "我仍然識又廢時架，又遲咁得仍得？"

But the original has "zi", so maybe it's a typo.

Alternatively, "zi" is "事" (ji6), so "廢事" (fai3 ji6), meaning "nonsense".

So "又廢事架" (jau6 fai3 ji6 gaa3), meaning "again nonsense?"

Then the second part: "use chi gang duck ng duck" = 又遲咁得仍得？

Maybe "又遲咁都冇得？" but "duck" is "得", so "又遲咁得仍得？" which might be "又遲咁都冇得？" but not matching.

Alternatively, "duck ng duck" = "都唔得" (dou1 m4 dak1), but "ng" as "唔".

If "ng" is "唔" (m4), then "duck ng duck" = 得唔得 (dak1 m4 dak1), meaning "can or not".

So "又遲咁得唔得？" which is "又遲咁得唔得？" meaning "Is it okay to be late like this?"

Putting it all together: "我仍然識又廢事架，又遲咁得唔得？"

But the first part: "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah" = 我仍然識又廢事架？

"我仍然識" means "I still know", but "又廢事架" is "again nonsense?"

So the whole sentence: "I still know it's nonsense, but is it okay to be late like this?"

But the translation should be in Cantonese characters. So:

我仍然識又廢事架，又遲咁得唔得？

But maybe "ngor ng" is "我人" but that's not correct. Alternatively, "ngor" is "我" and "ng" is "仍", so "我仍".

Wait, maybe "ngor ng" is a typo for "我仍" (ngo5 jing4).

So 2. 我仍識又廢事架，又遲咁得唔得？

But let's check if "fai zi" is "廢事". Yes, "廢事" is fai3 ji6, and "zi" might be a misspelling of "ji" as "zi" due to similar keys or pronunciation.

Moving to 3. "mud yeah lei ga?"

"mud" – could be "唔" (m4), "yeah" – "係" (hai6), "lei" – "理" (lei5), "ga" – "嘅" (ge3).

So "唔係理嘅？" but "mud yeah" = 唔係, "lei ga" = 理嘅?

Wait, "mud yeah lei ga?" = 唔係理嘅？

But "lei" is 理 (lei5), so "唔係理嘅？" which would be "Not about reasoning?" Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, "lei" could be "你" (nei5), but "mud yeah nei ga?" = 唔係你嘅？ (Isn't yours?)

But the phrase is "mud yeah lei ga?".

Wait, "lei" might be "曬" (saai3), but pronounced differently.

Alternatively, "mud" = 唔 (m4), "yeah" = 也 (jaa5), but not sure.

Wait, common phrase: "mud ying" = 唔應 (m4 jing1), but not here.

Another angle: "mud yeah" could be "毋也" but not Cantonese.

Wait, "mud" is likely "唔" (m4), "yeah" is "係" (hai6), so "mud yeah" = 唔係 (m4 hai6), meaning "is not".

"lei ga" – "lei" could be "理" (lei5), "ga" = 嘅 (ge3). So "唔係理嘅？" which is "Isn't it about reason?" Not quite.

Alternatively, "lei" is "曬" (saai3), but spelled as "lei".

Wait, maybe "lei" is "喇" (laa3), but "ga" is separate.

Wait, "mud yeah lei ga?" – perhaps "唔好意思咯？" but not matching.

Wait, another common phrase: "m4 jing4" = 唔聽 (not listen), but "yeah" is "hai6".

Wait, maybe "yeah" is "也" (jaa5), but in Cantonese, "also" is "亦" (jik6) or "都" (dou1).

Alternatively, "mud yeah" = "毋也", but not Cantonese.

Wait, think of "m4 hai6" = 唔係, so "mud yeah" is a misspelling of "m hai" as "mud yeah". So "mud yeah" = 唔係.

"lei ga" – "lei" could be "你" (nei5), but misspelled as "lei". So "唔係你嘅？" (Isn't yours?)

But the phrase is "mud yeah lei ga?", so if "lei" is "你", then it's "唔係你嘅？".

But why would "nei" be spelled as "lei"? Maybe a typo where 'n' is missing, or 'l' instead of 'n'.

In some romanization systems, 'n' and 'l' can be confused, but in Jyutping, 'n' and 'l' are distinct. However, in informal writing, people might mix them.

So "lei" could be "nei" (you), so "mud yeah lei ga?" = 唔係你嘅？

Which translates to "Isn't yours?"

So 3. 唔係你嘅？

But let's confirm. If "lei" is a typo for "nei", then yes.

4. "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah"

"but" – "唔" (m4), but spelled as "but" (like English "but"), but in Cantonese, "but" isn't a word. Wait, "but" could be "北" (bak1), but not likely.

Wait, "but yuu" – maybe "唔要" (m4 jiu3), where "but" is a misspelling of "m4" as "but" (since 'm' and 'b' are close on keyboard? No, 'm' is next to 'n', 'b' is elsewhere). Alternatively, "but" = "唔" (m4), and "yuu" = "要" (jiu3).

Yes, "but" might be a typo for "m4" as "but" (since 'm' and 'b' are not close, but maybe in pronunciation, "m" sounds like "um", and "but" is used as a placeholder).

So "but yuu" = 唔要 (m4 jiu3).

"yat chai" – "一齊" (jat1 cai4), meaning "together".

"yum cha" – "飲茶" (jam2 caa4), "drink tea".

"lah" – sentence particle.

So the phrase is "唔要一齊飲茶啦", which means "Don't drink tea together, okay!"

But the original is "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah", so "唔要一齊飲茶啦".

Yes, that makes sense.

5. "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu"

"gor" = 個 (go3)

"password" = 英文直接使用

"send jor hui" – "send" is English, "jor" might be "左" (zo2), "hui" might be "返" (faan1)

"nei gor yahoo email lu" = 你個yahoo email囉

So breaking it down:

"個 password send 左返你個 yahoo email 囉"

Which translates to "Sent the password back to your Yahoo email."

In proper Cantonese: 個password send左返你個yahoo email囉

But since we need to translate into Cantonese characters, "password" and "yahoo" would remain as English terms commonly used in Cantonese, but written in Chinese context. However, the instruction says to translate into Cantonese, which typically keeps loanwords like "password" and "email" as is, but written in Chinese characters where possible. However, "password" is often written as 密碼, and "email" as 電郵.

Wait, but the example translated "yahoo email" as part of the phrase, keeping "yahoo" as is. In the example given: "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" would be translated with "password" as 密碼 and "yahoo email" as yahoo電郵 or similar.

Wait, the user's example didn't have any English words; it was all translated to Chinese characters. Wait, looking back:

Example: "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => 你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？

So "tai sing con" is "睇歌唱比賽", all in Chinese characters. So likely, even if the Chinglish has English words like "password", we need to translate them into Chinese terms.

So "password" should be 密碼, "yahoo email" would be yahoo電郵, but "yahoo" is a proper noun, so it stays as 雅虎 (the Chinese name for Yahoo).

Wait, in Hong Kong, "Yahoo" is often written as 雅虎.

So "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu" becomes "個密碼send左返你個雅虎電郵囉"

But "send" is English, but in the translation, should it be translated to 寄? The phrase says "send jor hui", where "jor" is 左 (past tense), "hui" is 返 (back). So "send left back" = sent back.

So "個密碼寄左返你個雅虎電郵囉"

But the original has "send", so maybe in Chinglish they used "send" as is, but in translation, we use 寄.

Yes, so 5. 個密碼寄左返你個雅虎電郵囉

6. "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga"

"farn hok" – "返學" (faan1 hok6), go to school

"ho sun" – "好新" (hou2 san1), very new

"fu lor" – "福佬" (fuk1 lou5), but that's a term for Hokkien people. Alternatively, "fu" = 風 (fung1), "lor" = 呀 (aa3), but not sure.

Wait, "fu lor" might be "唔啦" (m4 laa3), but not matching.

Wait, "farn hok ho sun fu lor" – 返學好新鮮啦？

"sun" could be "鮮" (sin1), so "ho sun" = 好鮮 (hou2 sin1), but "新鮮" is san1 sin1.

Ah, "ho sun" might be "好新鮮" (hou2 san1 sin1), but written as "ho sun" where "sun" represents "新鮮".

Wait, "sun" in Cantonese for "新" is san1, so maybe "sun" is a misspelling of "san".

So "farn hok ho san sin fu lor" but the phrase is "farn hok ho sun fu lor".

Alternatively, "sun" = 新 (san1), "fu" = 鮮 (sin1), so "ho sun fu" = 好新鮮.

"lor" = 啦 (laa3).

So "返學好新鮮啦".

Then "gei si sin fong ga" – "gei" = 計 (gai3), "si" = 時 (si4), "sin" = 新 (san1), "fong" = 房 (fong4), "ga" = 嘅 (ge3).

So "計時新房子嘅？"

Wait, "gei si" could be "計時" (gai3 si4), timing.

"sin fong" = 新房子 (san1 fong4 zi2).

"ga" = 嘅 (ge3).

So the whole phrase: 返學好新鮮啦，計時新房子嘅？

But "好新鮮" usually means "very fresh", but in context, maybe "返學好新鮮啦" is "Going to school is so fresh!" which doesn't make much sense. Maybe "新鮮" here is used colloquially to mean "exciting" or "new experience".

Alternatively, "ho sun fu lor" could be "好新唔啦" but not sure.

Wait, another angle: "farn hok ho sun fu lor" – 返學好辛苦啦 (faan1 hok6 hou2 san1 fu1 laa3). "辛苦" (san1 fu1) means hard/tiring.

Yes! "sun fu" = 辛苦 (san1 fu1). So "ho sun fu" = 好辛苦.

"lor" = 啦 (laa3).

So "返學好辛苦啦".

Then "gei si sin fong ga" – 計時新房子嘅？

"gei si" = 計時 (gai3 si4), timing.

"sin fong" = 新房子 (san1 fong4 zi2).

"ga" = 嘅 (ge3).

So the translation: 返學好辛苦啦，計時新房子嘅？

But what does "計時新房子嘅" mean? "Timing the new house's..." Maybe "Is it timing for the new house?"

Alternatively, "gei si" could be "幾時" (gei2 si4), meaning "when".

Ah! That's probably it. "gei si" = 幾時 (gei2 si4), "when".

"sin fong" = 新房子 (san1 fong4 zi2), new house.

"ga" = 嘅 (ge3).

So "幾時新房子嘅？" which would be "When is the new house's...?" but more naturally, "When is the new house ready?"

So the full translation: 返學好辛苦啦，幾時新房子嘅？

But the phrase is "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga"

So 6. 返學好辛苦啦，幾時新房子嘅？

7. "yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok..."

"yau chin lar" – "yau" = 有 (jau5), "chin" = 錢 (cin4), "lar" = 喇 (laa3). So "有錢喇" (jau5 cin4 laa3), meaning "Have money already."

"daap sik si farn hok" – "daap" = 答 (daap3), "sik" = 食 (sik6), "si" = 四 (sei3), "farn hok" = 返學 (faan1 hok6).

Wait, "daap sik si farn hok" – 答食四返學？

Not making sense. Alternatively, "daap sik" = 答應 (daap3 jing1), "si" = 始 (ci2), but not sure.

Wait, "daap sik si farn hok" – 打濕四返學？

No. Another angle: "daap" = 大 (daai6), "sik" = 食 (sik6), "si" = 四 (sei3), "farn hok" = 返學.

"大食肆返學" – "Big restaurant go to school"? Doesn't make sense.

Wait, "daap sik" could be "打濕" (daa2 sap1), but "si" is 四.

Alternatively, "daap sik si" = 答應先 (daap3 jing1 sin1), meaning "agree first".

"farn hok" = 返學.

So "有錢喇，答應先返學..." which would be "Have money already, agree first to go to school..."

But the phrase is "yau chin lar, daap sik si farn hok..."

"daap sik si" – if "si" is 先 (sin1), then "daap sik si" = 答應先.

Yes, "si" could be a misspelling of "sin" (先).

So translation: 有錢喇，答應先返學...

8. "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung"

"kui doe" – 佢度 (keoi5 dou6), he/she here

"9 ng" – 九個 (gau2 go3), nine

"connect" – English word, probably 接駁 (zip3 but6)

"8 ge" – 八個 (baat3 go3), eight

"man" – 慢 (maan6), slow

"kui yat yeung" – 佢一樣 (keoi5 jat1 joeng6), he same

"yeah" – 也 (jaa5), also

"kui jau darp dai yeung" – 佢有打大樣 (keoi5 jau5 daa2 daai6 joeng6)? Not sure.

Breaking it down:

"kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge" – 佢度九個接駁八個

"man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung" – 慢佢一樣也佢有打大樣

Wait, "darp" might be "打" (daa2), "dai" = 大 (daai6), "yeung" = 樣 (joeng6).

So "kui jau darp dai yeung" = 佢有打大樣 (keoi5 jau5 daa2 daai6 joeng6), which means "he is showing off".

"man kui yat yeung" = 慢佢一樣 (maan6 keoi5 jat1 joeng6), but "慢" here might be "滿" (mun5), meaning "full".

Ah! "man" could be 滿 (mun5), so "滿佢一樣".

"yeah" = 也 (jaa5).

So the phrase: 佢度九個接駁八個，滿佢一樣也佢有打大樣

But "接駁" means connect, so "nine connect eight" might be a technical term, like in electronics, connecting 9 to 8.

"滿佢一樣" = mun5 keoi5 jat1 joeng6, meaning "fill his one type", but more likely "same as him".

Wait, "滿" might be "免" (min5),免佢一樣 = don't be like him.

But "man" as "min" is a stretch.

Alternatively, "man" = 萬 (maan6), but not sure.

Another angle: "man kui yat yeung" = 滿佢一樣 (mun5 keoi5 jat1 joeng6), meaning "as much as him".

But the phrase is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a technical description: "At his place, 9 connects to 8, and even though it's the same, he's showing off."

So translation: 佢度九個接駁八個，滿佢一樣也佢有打大樣

But need to verify.

9. "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju"

"need boot gei" – "need" is English, "boot" = 筆 (bat1), "gei" = 計 (gai3). So "need 筆計" = 需要筆計 (seoi1 jiu3 bat1 gai3), meaning "need a pen to calculate".

"wait me" = 等我 (dang2 ngo5)

"ng hoe hoi chi ju" – "ng" = 我 (ngo5), "hoe" = 好 (hou2), "hoi" = 開 (hoi1), "chi" = 始 (ci2), "ju" = 猪 (zyu1)? Not sure.

Wait, "ng hoe hoi chi ju" – 我好開支豬？

No. Alternatively, "hoe" = 學 (hok6), but not matching.

Wait, "ng" = 仍 (jing4), but earlier examples used "ng" as "我".

"ng hoe" = 我好 (ngo5 hou2)

"hoi chi ju" – 開支豬 (hoi1 zi1 zyu1), but "支" is zi1.

"hoi chi" = 開支 (hoi1 zi1), meaning "expenditure".

"ju" = 呀 (aa3), sentence particle.

So "我好開支呀" but "ju" might be "呀".

So the phrase: need 筆計，wait me，我好開支呀

Translating to Cantonese: 需要筆計，等我，我好開支呀

But "開支" is a noun, so "我好開支" would be "I am expenditure", which doesn't make sense. Maybe "開支" here is used as a verb, but it's not standard.

Alternatively, "hoi chi ju" = 開始呀 (hoi1 ci2 aa3), "start".

So "ng hoe hoi chi ju" = 我好開始呀 (ngo5 hou2 hoi1 ci2 aa3), meaning "I am starting well".

But "hoe" = 好 (hou2), so "我好開始呀" is grammatically off. It should be "我開始好呀" but not quite.

Wait, "ng hoe" = 我好 (I am), "hoi chi" = 開始 (to start), "ju" = 了 (laa3) or 呀 (aa3).

So "我好開始呀" – "I am starting already?"

But the phrase is "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju"

So translation: 需要筆計，等我，我好開始呀

But "boot gei" as 筆計 (bat1 gai3), which is "pen calculate", i.e., "need a pen to calculate".

10. "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai"

"yap sat" – 入室 (jap6 sat6), enter room

"yim sat" – 陰濕 (jam1 sap1), gloomy and damp

"gum gan" – 今晚 (gam1 gaan1), tonight

"gap zai" – 夾雜 (gaap3 zaap6), mix

But the phrase is "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai"

Alternatively, "yap sat" = 十八 (sap6 baat3), 18

"yim sat" = 陰濕 (jam1 sap1)

But "yap" is usually "jap" for 十.

Wait, "yap sat" could be 十八 (sap6 baat3), but "yap" isn't standard.

Another angle: "yap sat" = 業績 (jip6 zik1), but not matching.

Wait, common phrase: "yap sat" might be "熱辣" (jit6 laat3), but not sure.

Alternatively, "yap sat yim sat" = 十八廿二 (sap6 baat3 jaa6 ji6), meaning "18
