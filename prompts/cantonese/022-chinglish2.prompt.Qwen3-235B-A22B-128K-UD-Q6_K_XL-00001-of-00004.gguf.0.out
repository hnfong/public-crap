Sure! Here's a translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English:

---

## Alice:
Hah.  
Yeah, same here.  
I really like playing the card game,  
but I never gamble.  
:)

## Bob:
Oh right... I don’t gamble on Big Two either.  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:  
Was that the time when Joe was there?

## Bob:  
Yeah, I went to a friend’s house,  
and he wanted to play Big Two.  
So I said okay,  
but then he said we should play for 1 cent per card...  
(because he’s really good).  
And I was like, "So embarrassing..."  
Besides, I could lose up to like $10.

## Alice:  
Haha, that’s still okay.  
Hehe, you're just trying to scare me.  
Actually, it's fine. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

## Bob:  
But it’s not good to be too strict about it either...  
Yeah, gambling makes the game really stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:  
What program?  
Nope,  
I think I need to download something?

## Bob:  
Well, of course you need a program to play online...  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet...  
Maybe you can download it from me using FTP or HTTP...  
Wait...

## Alice:  
Okay, no problem.  
:)  
I’ll tell you if I need help.  
Hehe

Let me know if you'd like a more formal version or explanation of any terms like "Big Two" or "so hing"! [end of text]
