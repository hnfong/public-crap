The paragraph is written in Cantonese, and it expresses the frustration of a young person who is struggling to find a job. The person seems to be a young individual with limited work experience and educational qualifications. They are facing difficulties in finding employment and are particularly upset about companies offering low wages and expecting employees to work long hours without any prospects for career growth. The person also mentions that they are willing to work hard and do any job, but they feel that their lack of qualifications and experience is holding them back.

In their conclusion, the person blames the job market and the companies for not offering enough opportunities and for having unrealistic expectations. However, they also acknowledge that their own lack of qualifications and experience is a significant factor in their struggle to find employment.

While it is understandable that the person is frustrated with their situation, it is important to recognize that the job market is competitive, and companies often have specific requirements for their employees. It is also important to invest in oneself by gaining relevant skills and qualifications to increase one's chances of finding employment. Therefore, while the person's conclusion is valid to some extent, it is also important to take responsibility for one's own career development and work towards improving one's qualifications and experience.
