Make sure to use Cantonese grammar, e.g., "佢" for he/she, "呢個", "嗰個", "冇", "有", "係", "嘅". Use "銀包" as the word. Provide English translations in parentheses after each sentence.

Make sure to use Cantonese characters, not Mandarin. Use "銀包" not "钱包". Use "嘅" for possessive. Use "係" for "is". Use "唔" for "not". Use "冇" for "don't have". Use "喺" for "at/in". Use "啦". Use "呀". Use "啦". Use "咁". Use "啱啱". Use "啱啱". Use "好". Use "好似". Use "點". Use "點樣". Use "點解". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣". Use "點樣".

Make sure each sentence includes the word "銀包". Provide English translation in parentheses after each.

Let's craft 10 sentences:

1. 我唔記得將銀包放喺邊度，宜家好慌。 (I can't remember where I put my wallet, I'm feeling anxious now.)
2. 佢喺街市買嘢時，銀包俾人偷咗。 (His wallet was stolen while he was shopping at the market.)
3. 銀包入面只剩返幾蚊錢，真係要慳啲用。 (There are only a few dollars left in the wallet, really need to save.)
4. 我哋約好喺咖啡店見面，記得帶埋銀銀包先。 (We agreed to meet at the cafe, remember to bring your wallet.)
5. 呢個銀包好靚，係用真皮做嘅。 (This wallet is beautiful, it's made of genuine leather.)
6. 佢每次出街都會檢查銀包有冇帶埋身份證。 (He always checks if his wallet has his ID before going out.)
7. 銀包掉咗喺地鐵站，幸好有好心人交返俾我。 (The wallet fell at the subway station, luckily a kind person returned it to me.)
8. 我想買個新銀包，因為舊嘅已經爛到開口。 (I want to buy a new wallet because the old one is already torn open.)
9. 你睇下你銀包入面有冇足夠現金，今晚去飲酒。 (Check if you have enough cash in your wallet for tonight's drinks.)
10. 銀包係我最重要嘅私人物品，唔可以俾人隨便摸。 (The wallet is my most important personal item, it shouldn't be touched by anyone.)

Make sure to use Cantonese grammar: "銀銀包"? Actually "銀銀包" is a mistake; should be "銀包". Use "銀包". Use "佢" etc.

Check each sentence includes "銀包". Sentence 4: "帶埋銀銀包先" should be "帶埋銀包先". Let's correct.

Sentence 4: "記得帶埋銀包先". Good.

Sentence 5: "呢個銀包好靚，係用真皮做嘅。" Good.

Sentence 6: "佢每次出街都會檢查銀包有冇帶埋身份證。" Good.

Sentence 7: "銀包掉咗喺地鐵站，幸好有好心人交返俾我。" Good.

Sentence 8: "我想買個新銀包，因為舊嘅已經爛到開口。" Good.

Sentence 9: "你睇下你銀包入面有冇足夠現金，今晚去飲酒。" Good.

Sentence 10: "銀包係我最重要嘅私人物品，唔可以俾人隨便摸。" Good.

Now ensure English translations are in parentheses after each sentence.

Let's format:
