Hmm, this is a forum comment alleging misconduct by an award-winning police officer. The user asks whether I "buy the story" and wants an explanation. 

The comment comes from a self-proclaimed former colleague, using Cantonese slang like "衰穿櫃桶底" (catastrophic failure) and "vetting" (background check). The narrative has specific details—shadowing period, immediate termination threat, security escort—which could indicate insider knowledge. But the tone feels personal, almost vindictive, especially the vague "人品有啲問題" (character issues) without concrete examples.

Key red flags: the source is anonymous on a forum, no verifiable evidence is provided, and the timing coincides with the officer's recent award (possible sour grapes). The claim about passing police vetting despite alleged issues is contradictory—either the vetting failed, or the misconduct wasn't severe enough to disqualify him. 

I should weigh plausibility: workplace theft leading to immediate termination is realistic, but the leap to "character problems" feels subjective. The police force's vetting process is rigorous; if this were true, it likely would have surfaced earlier. The comment reads like gossip, not a formal report. 

My response should acknowledge the narrative's surface plausibility while highlighting its unverified nature and potential biases. Emphasize that without evidence, it remains hearsay, and the award suggests institutional validation of his service.

This comment presents an anecdotal claim from a self-identified former colleague about an award-winning police officer's past misconduct. Here’s a breakdown of whether the story is credible and why:

### **Why the story might seem plausible on the surface:**
1. **Specific details** – The comment mentions concrete elements: a one-year overlap at a "British-owned major bank," the officer shadowing the commenter in his first week, being fired for "stealing from the till" (衰穿櫃桶底), and being escorted out by security. These specifics can lend an air of authenticity.
2. **Motivation to share** – The commenter may be motivated by resentment, disbelief that someone with this past received an award, or a desire to warn others. This emotional tone is common in forum gossip.
3. **Possible vetting loophole** – Police vetting (especially in some jurisdictions) may not always uncover past minor employment offenses if they weren’t reported, prosecuted, or if the applicant didn’t disclose them. The commenter’s confusion ("唔知點解會過到vetting個關") reflects a common public misconception that vetting is infallible.

### **Why the story should be treated with caution:**
1. **Anonymous, unverified source** – This is a forum comment with no proof. The commenter’s identity and relationship to the officer cannot be confirmed. It could be fabricated, exaggerated, or from someone with a personal grudge.
2. **Lack of official record** – If the officer was fired for theft from a bank, that would typically involve police reports or internal records. No such evidence is provided. Serious financial misconduct in banking often leads to criminal charges, not just termination—yet the comment doesn’t mention police involvement at the time.
3. **Contradiction with award** – The officer has recently received an "outstanding policeman" award, implying positive performance and vetting by the police force. If the alleged theft were true and known, it would likely have prevented recruitment or later recognition. The commenter’s suggestion that he "passed vetting somehow" hints at suspicion but offers no explanation.
4. **Vague moral judgment** – The commenter says the officer has "人品有啲問題" (some character issues) but provides only the single alleged incident. This broad, subjective criticism weakens the claim’s objectivity.
5. **Potential for misinterpretation** – "衰穿櫃桶底" is colloquial and could mean a serious mistake (like a major error in handling cash) rather than intentional theft. The commenter may be interpreting an internal error as theft.

### **Conclusion: Do I "buy" the story?**
**No, not without corroborating evidence.** While the story contains details that could be based on real events, it remains an **unverified anecdote** from an anonymous source with possible bias. The gap between the alleged past misconduct and the officer’s current award suggests either:
- The incident was minor/misunderstood and didn’t affect his police career.
- The vetting process missed it (possible but not common for serious offenses).
- The story is exaggerated or false.

In the absence of documents, witnesses, or official records, this should be treated as **forum gossip**, not fact. The burden of proof lies with the accuser, and here it is unmet. The award indicates institutional acceptance of his integrity, which contradicts the gravity of the alleged offense. [end of text]
