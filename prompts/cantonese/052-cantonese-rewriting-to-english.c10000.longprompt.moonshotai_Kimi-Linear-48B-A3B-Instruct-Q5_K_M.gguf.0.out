Certainly! Here's a rewritten version of the essay in clear, natural English, preserving the original meaning and tone as much as possible:

Three hours after finishing work and returning home, I was browsing the internet when I saw someone mourning the passing of Yu Ying-shih. At the time, I only knew that he was a favorite scholar of Professor Wang Wei-hsiung, a well-known blogger. That was all I knew about him.

However, in the 21st century, we no longer need to constantly consult teachers. With Google, we can access all the information we need. After doing some research, I gradually began to understand why he was so respected and why Professor Wang often mentioned him.

Yu Ying-shih had been a professor at three Ivy League universities. Isn’t that impressive? Just the mention of that would be enough to intimidate most people.

I started digging into his background like a stalker—reading his Chinese and English Wikipedia entries, looking at the praise he received when he won awards, and even checking out the obituaries written about him today. In my mind, he reminded me of my most respected teacher, Mr. Yun. They really were quite similar!

Unfortunately, Mr. Yun didn’t hold a professorship at Harvard, but both he and Yu Ying-shih shared a deep commitment to traditional Chinese scholarship—what some call “comprehensive knowledge” and “I am China.” Mr. Yun was fond of Daoism and Buddhism, while Yu Ying-shih seemed to be a devoted follower of Confucianism.

But here’s the problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, as well as respect for hierarchy and proper conduct between ruler and subject. But if you studied at a top university in the United States, especially during the height of the hippie movement, and then returned with a PhD, would you really go around teaching people to “respect teachers and value the way,” while warning against individualism? That would be quite a contradiction.

As scholars, how do you avoid being a hypocrite? Confucius spent his entire life trying to figure that out. In Confucius’s time, the world was in chaos, and he traveled among the states hoping to find a position where he could serve and make a difference. But he was only good at reciting the rites of the Zhou dynasty and didn’t know how to flatter his superiors. In the end, he returned empty-handed. However, his failures became the foundation for his students’ success. Sima Qian wrote: “Among the seventy disciples of Confucius, those who went to serve in various states became either teachers, advisors, or high-ranking officials. Those who stayed behind became friends and mentors to scholars.” Why was that?

Because over the generations, they learned to read the subtle cues of rulers. By Mencius’s time, interactions with rulers had already changed. Mencius could joke and laugh with kings, flattering them when needed: “King X, I don’t think you could even bear to kill a cow. You must be a true benevolent ruler. If you follow the kingly way, you’ll succeed!”

By the end of the Warring States period, Confucian strategists had become masters at playing the “king interview” game. To get a position, they abandoned “benevolence” and “ritual” entirely and focused on the new “legalist” approach. So, even though Xunzi was a Confucian, one of his students, Li Si, became a high-ranking official under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. There was no trace of Confucius’s spirit in Li Si.

Today, with over 100 to 200 countries in the United Nations, the world is even more complex than during the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian scholars who left China—the so-called “land of ritual”—and went to the wild, militaristic United States, would they really go around quoting the *Analects* and telling people to observe three years of mourning? When Confucius and his disciples were rejected time and again in the past, everyone knows how difficult it was. So, in America, Confucian scholars had to say that Confucius supported democracy, that democracy is great, and that communists are scum. Only then could they become Ivy League professors.

Some might ask: what’s the harm in that? Of course, there’s no harm. Confucius and Mencius have been dead for over two thousand years, and the Confucian tradition was already shattered during the May Fourth Movement. As the academic authority of the only major power after World War II, people might even believe that Johnny Kung (a reference to a fictional or symbolic figure) taught people to take drugs and sleep around. After all, the U.S. is known for its “theoretical nuclear weapons”—a metaphor for its cultural and ideological influence. Just look at what happened when the Japanese didn’t believe in it.

So why was Yu Ying-shih able to get a PhD just by translating a few lines from the *Book of Han* into English and become a professor at several universities? You know what I mean. Once they put you on a pedestal as an authority, they want you to speak with conviction: “Everyone here is a duck. You think Confucian thought is feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, Confucius was a democratic fighter! If you don’t have a Harvard chair, just listen quietly!”

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy—well, “sinologists” probably don’t know much about that. You say: “The Republic of China is an example.” Come on, Taiwan’s political system is Confucian? The Kuomintang leaders curse蔡英文 every day. Is that how Confucianism works? Does蔡英文 bow to heaven and earth in ceremonial fashion? No, she doesn’t. That’s not Confucian. Science and rationality, not superstition—that’s against Confucian principles. Do you think using Chinese characters makes something Confucian? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, and so is the UK (at least among the developed countries, the UK is the most Confucian): the ruler speaks with propriety and ceremony, power is granted by heaven, supreme and untouchable, with clear hierarchies—no one can challenge the order. As for their success or failure in democracy, that’s not something a Chinese American is qualified to comment on.

### Commentary (Disregarding the Sarcastic Tone)

The author’s main point is a critique of the way Confucianism is selectively appropriated and reinterpreted in Western academic and political contexts, particularly in the United States. While the tone is sarcastic and at times ironic, the underlying message is serious:

- **Confucianism is often misrepresented or distorted** when it is used to justify or align with Western democratic values, especially in academic settings.
- The author questions the authenticity of this reinterpretation, suggesting that it is more about political convenience or academic prestige than genuine understanding or respect for Confucian thought.
- The essay also critiques the hypocrisy of some scholars who advocate for Confucian values in theory but ignore or reject them in practice, especially when it comes to political systems or social norms.
- Ultimately, the author argues that Confucianism is deeply rooted in Chinese cultural and historical contexts, and its values may not easily translate or apply to Western democratic systems without significant reinterpretation or contradiction.

In short, the essay is a sharp critique of cultural appropriation and the instrumental use of Confucianism in Western discourse, especially in academic and political spheres. [end of text]
