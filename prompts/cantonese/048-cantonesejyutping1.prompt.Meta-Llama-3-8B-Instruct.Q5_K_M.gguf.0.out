呢度有幾句廣東話，有六隻字，聲調由 1 至 6

- 七碗半牛腩麵 (cat1 wun2 bun3 ngau4 naam5 min6)
- 三嬸過勞養病 (saam1 sam2 gwo3 lou4 joeng5 beng6)
- 仙子過年禮待 (sin1 zi2 gwo3 nin4 lai5 doi6)

不如你又試下自己寫幾句。

Let me try to come up with a few more Cantonese sentences with six characters and tone numbers from 1 to 6. Here they are:

- 五星級食堂食 (ng5 sing1 kap6 sihk6 tung1 sihk6) - "Five-star restaurant food"
- 三個小孩玩到 (saam1 go3 siu2 hai6 wu6 dou6) - "Three little kids play together"
- 七十二小時班 (cat1 cat1 baak3 siu2 si2 ban1) - "Seventy-two hours' class"

Please note that Cantonese is a complex language with many variations, and the tone numbers may vary depending on the dialect and accent. These are just my attempts to create sentences with the correct tone numbers based on the Jyutping romanization system.
