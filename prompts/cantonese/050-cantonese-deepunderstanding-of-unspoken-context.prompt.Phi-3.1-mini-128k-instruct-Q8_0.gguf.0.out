 The person in the paragraph appears to be a job seeker who has been unsuccessful in finding a job despite their efforts. They are currently facing the problem of not being able to secure a job, which has led them to question the effectiveness of using cash incentives to attract potential candidates. They also express frustration over the competitive job market and their lack of experience and education, which they believe are hindering their chances of finding employment.

The person concludes that it is not the responsibility of the company to offer cash incentives to attract job seekers, as they believe that the job seekers themselves have issues that prevent them from being chosen. They seem to be blaming the job seekers for not having a better future and not being able to make the right choices.

In my opinion, the person's conclusion is not entirely fair or objective. While it is true that job seekers need to have the necessary skills, experience, and education to be competitive in the job market, it is also the responsibility of companies to provide attractive job offers and create a positive work environment. Cash incentives can be one of the many factors that job seekers consider when choosing a potential employer.

Moreover, the person's frustration and lack of confidence in their abilities may be affecting their job search. Instead of blaming the job seekers, companies should focus on providing training and development opportunities to help job seekers improve their skills and increase their chances of finding employment. This approach benefits both the job seekers and the companies, as it creates a more skilled and motivated workforce.

In conclusion, while the person's situation is challenging, it is essential to recognize that both job seekers and companies have a role to play in the job market. Companies should strive to provide attractive job offers and support job seekers in their career development, while job seekers should also take responsibility for improving their skills and making informed decisions about their career paths.
