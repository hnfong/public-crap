 [/INST] The paragraph describes the situation of a job seeker who is having difficulty finding employment. The author questions why companies would use cash incentives to attract job seekers when they themselves do not meet the qualifications for the job. The author expresses frustration about not having experience or education, and wonders what they have to offer to potential employers. They mention that they are only 13 years old and are willing to work, but their personal circumstances do not align with the job market. The author ultimately concludes that the reason they cannot find a job is not because of low company offers, but because of their own personal issues.

In terms of the objective situation, the author is a young job seeker who is facing challenges in finding employment due to a lack of experience and education. The problem is that the author feels unqualified for the jobs they are applying to and is frustrated with the lack of opportunities available to them. The author's conclusion is that their personal circumstances are the reason they cannot find a job, rather than external factors such as low company offers.

I agree with the author's conclusion that personal circumstances can play a significant role in job search success. However, it is important to note that external factors such as the job market and company offers can also impact one's ability to find employment. It may be helpful for the author to continue gaining experience and education to improve their qualifications and increase their chances of finding a job. Additionally, they may want to consider expanding their job search to include opportunities that align more closely with their current skills and experience.
