Okay, let me analyze this forum comment about an award-winning policeman named Chan Tai-man. The commenter claims to be his former bank colleague who worked with him at a British bank. 

First, I notice several red flags in the story. The commenter says Chan was fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" which literally means "wearing through the cabinet bottom" - that's not standard Cantonese for any known workplace offense. In banking contexts, serious misconduct would involve terms like fraud or theft, not this odd phrase. 

Hmm... the timeline also seems off. If Chan was fired immediately after lunch one day, how did he have time to "辗转" (go through twists and turns) to become a police officer? Police vetting takes months - you can't just switch careers overnight after being fired for misconduct. 

Ah! The biggest inconsistency: the commenter says Chan was a "學警" (probationary officer) but then claims he got an award for being an "outstanding policeman". In Hong Kong police ranks, 學警 are trainees who haven't even graduated from the academy yet - they can't receive service awards. 

*checks Hong Kong police protocols* 
Right, vetting for police recruits is extremely thorough - they'd definitely catch any prior dismissal for misconduct. The commenter's claim that Chan "不知點解會過到vetting" (somehow passed vetting) contradicts standard procedures. 

Also suspicious: the commenter uses overly dramatic language like "押住執野走" (escorted while packing) which sounds like TV drama dialogue. Real workplace dismissals are usually more discreet. 

*notices linguistic quirks*
The phrase "老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官" mixes informal Cantonese with unnatural phrasing. A real manager would say "即刻離職" not "即日走", and threatening to call police over dismissal is legally dubious - employers don't usually do that for standard terminations. 

Putting it all together: 
- Impossible timeline 
- Incorrect police terminology 
- Unprofessional dismissal scenario 
- Linguistic inconsistencies 
- Contradicts police vetting standards 

This smells like a fabricated story. Probably someone trying to discredit the award recipient with a made-up anecdote. The details don't align with how banks or police forces actually operate in Hong Kong.

Based on the details provided in the Cantonese comment, **I do NOT believe this story is credible**. Here's a breakdown of the red flags and inconsistencies, explained clearly:

---

### **Key Reasons to Doubt the Story**
#### 1. **Impossible Timeline & Career Path**
   - The commenter claims Chan Tai-man (陳大文) was **fired from a bank on the spot** ("即日走", escorted out by security after lunch), then "辗转" (through twists and turns) became a police officer.
   - **Reality check**:  
     - Police recruitment in Hong Kong involves **rigorous vetting** (including background checks, interviews, and psychological assessments) that takes **6–12 months**.  
     - If Chan was fired for serious misconduct (e.g., "衰穿櫃桶底" – see point 2), he **would fail vetting immediately**. Police forces *never* hire candidates with unexplained dismissals for integrity issues.  
     - **Critical error**: The commenter calls him "學警" (probationary officer/trainee), but the award is for an "outstanding policeman." **學警 cannot receive service awards** – they are still in training (typically 2 years). Awards like this are for *serving officers* with years of experience.  

#### 2. **Nonsensical Reason for Dismissal**
   - "衰穿櫃桶底" (literally: "wore through the cabinet bottom by being unlucky") **is not a real workplace offense**.  
     - In banking contexts, dismissals involve concrete issues like fraud, theft, or negligence – not vague, superstitious phrases.  
     - If Chan did something illegal (e.g., stealing from a cabinet), the bank would **call police immediately** – not just threaten to. The phrase sounds like a made-up Cantonese idiom from TV dramas, not real corporate language.  

#### 3. **Inconsistent Terminology & Procedures**
   - **"老細...報官" (Boss threatened to call police)**:  
     Employers don’t threaten to "call police" for standard dismissals. If a crime occurred (e.g., theft), police would be called *during* the incident – not as a post-dismissal threat.  
   - **"押住執野走" (Escorted while packing)**:  
     Standard procedure for terminated employees involves a quiet exit (often with HR present). **Security escorting someone out** implies criminal activity – which would absolutely disqualify him from police vetting.  
   - **Vetting failure**: The commenter admits Chan "有啲問題" (has issues) but claims he "不知點解會過到 vetting" (somehow passed vetting). **This is impossible** – police vetting *always* uncovers prior dismissals, especially for integrity breaches. If true, the award committee would have revoked his award.  

#### 4. **Linguistic & Cultural Inconsistencies**
   - The phrase "衰穿櫃桶底" is **not used in real Hong Kong workplaces**. It’s a mix of slang and superstition (like "jinxing the cabinet") – more fitting for a comedy show than a serious bank.  
   - The tone is **overly dramatic** ("下晝我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走"), mimicking TVB police dramas where villains get escorted out. Real corporate dismissals are discreet.  
   - **"英資大行" (British bank)**: Major banks (e.g., HSBC, Standard Chartered) have strict HR protocols. They’d never allow a new hire to commit a serious offense in "one week" without prior warnings.  

---

### **Why Would Someone Fabricate This?**
- **Motives**:  
  - To discredit an award recipient (e.g., personal grudge, jealousy).  
  - To spread misinformation (common in polarized online spaces).  
- **Tactics used**:  
  - Vague, sensational claims ("品有啲問題") without evidence.  
  - Misuse of jargon ("學警", "vetting") to sound credible.  
  - Emotional language ("輾轉走左去考警察") to imply a "fall from grace."  

---

### **Conclusion: This is Almost Certainly Fake**
- **Police vetting is extremely thorough** – no one with a recent dismissal for misconduct would become an officer, let alone win an award.  
- The story **contradicts real-world procedures** in both banking and policing.  
- The language is **dramatic, inconsistent, and unprofessional** – typical of fabricated online rumors.  

> 🚩 **Verdict**: **Do NOT believe this story.** It’s a classic example of a "smear campaign" using half-truths and TV-drama logic. If Chan received an official award, his background was vetted multiple times – and this alleged incident would have disqualified him immediately. Always verify claims about public figures through official channels (e.g., police press releases, bank statements), not anonymous forum posts.
