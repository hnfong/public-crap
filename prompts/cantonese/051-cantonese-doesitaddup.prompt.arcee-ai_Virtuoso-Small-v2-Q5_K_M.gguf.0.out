The story seems to be a mix of factual details and potentially exaggerated or fabricated elements. Here's a breakdown of the key points and their credibility:

1. **Professional Background**: The narrator claims to be a former colleague of the award-winning policeman, Chen Damin, at a British-owned large bank. This part is plausible, as it's common for people to work in financial institutions and then transition to other careers, including law enforcement.

2. **Incident with the Suitcase**: The narrator mentions that Chen was fired for wearing a suitcase as a briefcase, which led to his dismissal. This detail seems highly improbable and exaggerated. It's unlikely that such a minor and unusual incident would lead to immediate termination, especially in a professional setting.

3. **Management's Threat**: The claim that Chen was threatened with a police report if he didn't leave immediately is also questionable. While it's possible that management might have taken strong action against an employee, the specific threat of involving the police seems extreme and unlikely.

4. **Security Escort**: The detail about Chen being escorted out by security and high-level management is more plausible. It's not uncommon for security to be involved in the removal of an employee, especially if there's a need to ensure a smooth transition or prevent any potential issues.

5. **Career Transition**: The fact that Chen subsequently became a police officer is a reasonable career change. Many people transition from other professions to law enforcement, and it's not unusual for someone to face challenges in their previous career before finding success in a new one.

6. **Character Assessment**: The narrator's final comment about Chen's personal character and how he passed the vetting process is subjective and potentially biased. The vetting process for police officers is rigorous and would likely have uncovered any significant issues with an applicant's character or background.

In conclusion, while some parts of the story are plausible, others seem exaggerated or unlikely. The incident with the suitcase and the immediate threat of police involvement are particularly questionable. The overall narrative suggests a mix of factual details and potentially biased or fabricated elements. Without further verification, it's difficult to fully assess the credibility of the entire story. [end of text]
