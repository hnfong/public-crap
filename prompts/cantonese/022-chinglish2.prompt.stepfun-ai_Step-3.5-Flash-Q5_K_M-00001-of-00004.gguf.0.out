Hmm, the user wants this chat translated into simple English. The conversation is in a mix of English and what looks like Singlish/Cantonese-influenced slang. Need to decode the informal phrases while keeping the casual tone.

First, Alice's lines: "hah. yeh. me 2." is just laughter and agreement. "I like to play very much gah" - "gah" seems like a filler word, so just "I really like playing." "but never gamble lor" - "lor" is a casual particle, so "but I never gamble." The smiley stays.

Bob's "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" - "orr" might be "or" or hesitation, "big2" is likely the card game Big Two. "except for that time a few weeks ago" is straightforward.

Alice's "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?" - "joe mud" might be "just now" or "that time"? Wait, context suggests she's asking about the incident. Maybe "joe mud" is "just now" but that doesn't fit. Could be "that time" in Cantonese? Actually, "joe mud" might be "just now" but she's referring to weeks ago... Hmm. Looking at Bob's reply, he mentions "a few weeks ago" so Alice is confirming. Maybe "joe mud" is "that time" or "that incident"? I'll interpret as "that time a few weeks ago?"

Bob's explanation: "went to a friends house" - missing apostrophe. "he wanted to play big2 wor" - "wor" is a particle. "gum i say play lor" - "gum" might be "then" or "so"? Actually, in Singlish "gum" can be "so" or "then". "gum he said 1 cent for a card..." - so "then he said..." "gum I fai si 'so hing' la..." - "fai si" might be "I said" and "so hing" could be "so little"? Actually, "so hing" might be "so little" in Cantonese? "hing" sounds like "little" (少). So "I said 'that's so little'..." "besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..." - "jeh" is a particle, "sth" is something.

Alice: "gum yau hai" - "yau hai" might be "also" or "too"? Actually, "yau hai" could be "有冇" (have or not) but here it might be "also". Wait, she says "gum yau hai :)" - maybe "so also" meaning "same here"? Then "hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - this is messy. "lei gor" might be "you all"? "yuun doe" could be "why do"? "gei moe sor wai" - "gei" might be "give", "moe" is "no"? Actually, "moe" earlier was "no" or "not". "sor wai" might be "so why"? Let me piece: "hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - maybe "hehe. you all why do give no so why?" That doesn't make sense. Perhaps "lei gor" is "you guys", "yuun doe" is "why do", "gei" is "give", "moe" is "not", "sor wai" is "so why"? Actually, she might be saying "you guys why do [you] give [me] no [answer] so why?" But that's awkward. Alternatively, "gei moe" could be "give me"? "gei" as "give", "moe" as "me"? But "moe" earlier was "no". Hmm. Looking at context: Bob asked if she has the program. She says "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth". So "meh program" might be "what program?" or "that program?" Actually, "meh" could be "what" in Cantonese? "meh" is often "what" in informal writing. So "what program?" Then "moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth" - "moe" might be "no", "hai" is "have", "ng" is "I", "hai yiu" is "need to"? So "no have I need to download or something"? That is "I don't have it, do I need to download or something?" But she says "moe hai ng hai yiu" - maybe "no have I need to"? Actually, "hai" can be "have", "ng" is "I", "hai yiu" is "need to". So "I don't have it, do I need to download?" But she says "moe hai ng hai yiu" - "moe" might be "no" as in "not", so "not have I need to"? That's confusing. Perhaps "moe" is "no" as in "no, I don't have it"? Actually, she might be saying "no, I don't have it, do I need to download?" But the structure is off. Let's see the whole: "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth :)" - maybe "what program? no, I don't have it, do I need to download or something?" But "moe hai" might be "no have" meaning "don't have". So "I don't have it, do I need to download?" But she says "ng hai yiu" - "I need to"? Actually, "hai yiu" is "need to". So "I don't have it, I need to download?" That seems like she's asking if she needs to download. But the "or sth" suggests uncertainty. So I'll translate as "What program? I don't have it. Do I need to download it or something?"

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la..." - "gum" again "so", "of coz" is "of course", "ga la" is a particle. So "So to play online, of course you need a program to play." "my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..." - straightforward.

Alice: "hoe ark. :)" - "hoe ark" might be "how about"? Or "how" something? Actually, "hoe" could be "how", "ark" might be "or"? But she says "hoe ark." after Bob's offer. Maybe "how about?" or "okay?" Actually, "hoe ark" might be "how about" but she already said "ng goi sai" which is "thank you" in Cantonese? "ng goi sai" is "thank you" (多謝). So "hoe ark." might be "how about?" but then "hehe". So perhaps "hoe ark" is "how about?" as in "how about that?" But she says "ng goi sai" which is "thank you". So maybe "hoe ark" is "how are you?" but that doesn't fit. Actually, "hoe ark" might be "how about" but she's responding to Bob's offer. Perhaps "hoe ark" is "okay then?" or "alright?" But "hoe" is "how", "ark" might be "or"? Hmm. Alternatively, "hoe ark" could be a typo for "how about"? But she says "ng goi sai" after, so "thank you". So maybe "hoe ark" is "how are you?" but that seems off. Let's look at the sequence: Bob says he can send via FTP/HTTP. Alice says "hoe ark. :)" then "ng goi sai" then "hehe". So "hoe ark" might be "how about?" as in "how about that?" or "is that okay?" But she's thanking him, so perhaps "hoe ark" is "okay then?" Actually, in some contexts, "hoe" might be "好" (good) and "ark" might be "or"? Not sure. Maybe "hoe ark" is "how about" but she's agreeing. I think I'll translate "hoe ark" as "How about that?" or just "Okay." But to keep it simple, maybe "Okay then." Since she thanks him next.

So overall, the translation should be casual and simple, capturing the informal tone. I'll convert the slang to standard English while keeping the meaning.

Let me draft:

Alice: Hah. Yeah, me too. I really like playing, but I never gamble. :)

Bob: Or... I never gamble on Big Two either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: That time a few weeks ago?

Bob: Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I said okay to play. Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays very well) so I said "that's so little"... besides, at most lose something like $10.

Alice: Same here. :) Hehe. You guys why do [you] give [me] no [answer] so why? It's good actually. But if I were to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

Wait, the "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" part is tricky. Maybe she's saying "you all why do give me no so why?" That doesn't make sense. Perhaps "gei moe" is "give me"? "gei" as "give", "moe" as "me"? But "moe" earlier was "no". Actually, in Cantonese, "gei" can be "give", "moe" might be "me" (我) but "moe" is often "no" in Singlish. Hmm. Alternatively, she might be saying "you guys why do [you] give [me] such a small amount?" But "sor wai" might be "so why"? Actually, "sor" could be "such", "wai" is "why"? Not sure. Given the context, she's talking about the small stakes. Bob said 1 cent per card, she said "so hing" (so little). Then she says "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - maybe "you guys why do give me such little [money] why?" But that's awkward. Perhaps she's asking "why do you guys give such little [stakes]?" But she says "gei moe" which might be "give me"? Actually, "gei" is "give", "moe" might be "me" but in Cantonese "me" is 我, which is "ngo" not "moe". "moe" is often "no" in Singlish. So maybe "gei moe" is "give no" meaning "don't give"? That doesn't fit. Let's re-read: "hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - perhaps it's "hehe. you all why do give no such why?" That is nonsense. Maybe it's a typo or mishearing. Could be "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" -> "you guys why do give me such small [amount]?" But "sor" might be "small"? Actually, "sor" could be "少" (little) in Cantonese? "sor" is often "少" meaning little. So "gei moe sor wai" might be "give me little why?" But "wai" is "why". So "give me little why?" meaning "why give me so little?" But she's not being given money; it's about stakes. Perhaps she's saying "you guys why do [you] set such little stakes?" But "gei" is "give", not "set". Hmm.

Maybe I should look at the whole sentence: "hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai it's good actually." So she's saying something then "it's good actually." So the part before might be "you guys why do give me no such why?" but that doesn't connect. Perhaps "gei moe sor wai" is "give me such small [stakes]?" and "sor wai" is "small why?" meaning "why so small?" But then "it's good actually" contradicts. Actually, she says "it's good actually" meaning the small stakes are good? Because she doesn't want to gamble much. So she might be saying "you guys why do [you] give such small [stakes]? it's good actually." But "give" might not be right. Maybe "set" or "play for". Alternatively, "gei" might be a typo for "gi" or something. Given the difficulty, I'll interpret as "you guys why do [you] set such small stakes? it's good actually." But she says "gei moe" which might be "give me" but she's not receiving. Perhaps she's referring to Bob's story: "he said 1 cent for a card" so she's commenting on that. So "you guys" might refer to Bob and his friend? But she's talking to Bob. So "you guys" might be "you and your friend". So "you and your friend why do [you] set such small stakes? it's good actually." But "gei moe" is problematic. Maybe "gei" is "give" as in "give [as in bet]"? In gambling, "give" might mean "offer" or "bet". So "give such small [bets]". So I'll go with "you guys why do you bet such small amounts? it's good actually."

Then: "but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor" - "ngor" is "I", "juun hai" might be "if I", "yiu gamble" is "to gamble". So "but if I were to gamble, I would not enjoy the game thoroughly."

Bob: "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga..." - "stand so hard" might be "be so stubborn" or "insist so much"? Actually, "stand so hard" could be "hold so firm" but in context, Alice said she wouldn't enjoy if she gambles, so Bob might be saying it's not good to be so firm about not gambling? Or "stand so hard" might mean "play so seriously"? Hmm. He says "yea if need to gamble it's very stressful..." so he agrees gambling is stressful. "stand so hard" might be "be so hard-headed" or "insist so much". But Alice didn't insist; she just said she wouldn't enjoy. Maybe Bob is saying it's not good to be so strict about not gambling? Actually, Alice said "if I were to gamble I would not enjoy" meaning she avoids gambling to enjoy the game. Bob says "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga..." meaning "but it's not very good to be so firm [in your stance]?" But then he agrees that gambling is stressful. So perhaps he means "but it's not very good to be so hard on yourself [by not gambling at all]?" But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, "stand so hard" might be a phrase meaning "play so aggressively"? But in Big Two, "stand" might refer to something. Actually, in card games, "stand" can mean to not take another card, but here it's probably idiomatic. I think "stand so hard" means "be so stubborn" or "be so rigid". So I'll translate as "but it's not very good to be so stubborn about it..."

Then "btw, do u have the program?" - straightforward.

Alice: "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth :)" - as above, "What program? I don't have it. Do I need to download it or something?"

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la..." - "So to play online, of course you need a program to play." Then about file transfer.

Alice: "hoe ark. :) ng goi sai hehe" - "Okay then. :) Thank you. Hehe"

So final translation:

Alice: Hah. Yeah, me too. I really like playing, but I never gamble. :)

Bob: Or... I never gamble on Big Two either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: That time a few weeks ago?

Bob: Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I said okay to play. Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays very well) so I said "that's so little"... besides, at most lose something like $10.

Alice: Same here. :) Hehe. You guys why do you bet such small amounts? It's good actually. But if I were to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

Bob: But it's not very good to be so stubborn about it... Yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful... By the way, do you have the program?

Alice: What program? I don't have it. Do I need to download it or something? :)

Bob: So to play online, of course you need a program to play. My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

Alice: Okay then. :) Thank you. Hehe

I think that captures the meaning. The "stand so hard" part is ambiguous, but "stubborn" seems reasonable. The "lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" I interpreted as "you guys why do you bet such small amounts?" based on context. She's commenting on the small stakes Bob mentioned.
