No, I don’t buy the story — and here’s why:

1. **Timeline and Logic Contradiction**  
   The commenter claims the person (Chan Da Wen) was fired from a bank *after only one week on the job*, and that the boss threatened to report him to the police — yet the person still passed vetting to become a police officer. That’s highly implausible.  
   - Police vetting (especially in Hong Kong or similar jurisdictions) is *extremely* rigorous. It includes background checks, criminal record reviews, psychological assessments, and often interviews with former employers.  
   - If someone was fired for “wearing a torn drawer bottom” (a literal, absurdly petty reason), that’s not a criminal offense — it’s a workplace disciplinary issue.  
   - Even if the employer threatened to report him, that doesn’t mean he’d be *arrested or convicted* — and certainly not enough to disqualify him from police vetting.  
   - The commenter’s own story sounds like a joke — “衰穿櫃桶底” (bad luck wearing a torn drawer bottom) — which is not a real reason for termination, let alone a reason to be fired and then “report to police.”

2. **The “Vetting” Claim is Absurd**  
   The commenter says “佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關” — implying that the person’s character is questionable, yet he passed vetting.  
   - If the person’s character is truly problematic, vetting would have *failed*.  
   - Police vetting is designed to *filter out* people with criminal records, mental health issues, or serious character flaws.  
   - The commenter’s own story doesn’t provide any evidence of serious misconduct — just a silly, petty workplace incident.  
   - So the claim that he “passed vetting” despite “personal problems” is either a lie or a misunderstanding of what vetting entails.

3. **The Story Sounds Like a Joke or a Lie**  
   The entire narrative — “torn drawer bottom,” “boss threatens to report him,” “he gets fired,” “then goes to police school” — sounds like a joke or a fabrication.  
   - It’s not a realistic workplace scenario.  
   - It’s not a plausible reason for someone to be disqualified from police vetting.  
   - The commenter is trying to imply that the person is “not trustworthy” — but the story doesn’t support that claim.

4. **The Commenter’s Own Credibility is Questionable**  
   The commenter says they were a “former colleague” — but they don’t provide any evidence to support their claims.  
   - No names, no dates, no specific details.  
   - The story is vague and full of exaggeration.  
   - The commenter’s tone suggests they’re trying to discredit the person — but they’re doing so with a weak, implausible story.

**Conclusion:**  
This is not a credible story. It’s either a joke, a fabrication, or a misunderstanding of what police vetting entails. The commenter is trying to cast doubt on the person’s character — but their own story doesn’t support that claim.  
I don’t buy it.
