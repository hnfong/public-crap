The person in this paragraph appears to be a middle-aged individual, possibly a veteran in the workforce, who is commenting on the current job market. He is observing that many young and attractive individuals (referred to as "靚仔靚妹") are having trouble finding jobs, despite their physical appearance. The overall situation is that the job market is competitive, and companies are using high salaries to attract top talent. The problem the young job seekers have run into is that they lack experience and qualifications, making it difficult for them to secure employment.

The person's argument is that the young job seekers' lack of qualifications and experience makes it impossible for them to compete in the job market, and that they should not be picky about job conditions such as salary, working hours, and job security. He believes that if they are not willing to accept lower-paying jobs or jobs with fewer benefits, they will be left with no choice but to remain unemployed. He also mentions that he himself started working at the age of 13 and did not mind the difficulties and low pay, implying that the young generation is too spoiled and lacks the resilience to succeed in the workforce.

I partially agree with his conclusion. On one hand, it is true that the job market is highly competitive, and having relevant experience and qualifications can be a significant advantage. It is also true that some young job seekers may be too picky about job conditions and may need to be more flexible and open-minded when looking for employment. On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that the job market has changed significantly since the person's time, and that many young people today face unique challenges such as student loan debt, rising living costs, and a rapidly changing job market. Additionally, it is not entirely fair to expect young people to accept low-paying jobs or poor working conditions without questioning the systemic issues that contribute to these problems. A more nuanced approach would be to encourage young people to be flexible and open-minded while also advocating for better job conditions and more supportive policies to help them succeed in the workforce.
