I don't buy the story. Here's why:

1. The story is inconsistent with the facts of the situation. The person who was shadowed by the officer was a bank colleague, not a police officer. The officer was a bank employee, not a police officer.

2. The story is also inconsistent with the timeline. The officer was new to the force and was shadowed in the first week. The person who was shadowed was a bank employee, not a police officer.

3. The story is also inconsistent with the police procedures. The police would not typically shadow a bank employee, and there's no indication that the officer was involved in any criminal activity.

4. The story is also inconsistent with the police's standard procedures for vetting new officers. The police would not typically require a new officer to be held by security for a week before being allowed to start their job.

Overall, the story is not credible and is likely a fabrication. [end of text]
