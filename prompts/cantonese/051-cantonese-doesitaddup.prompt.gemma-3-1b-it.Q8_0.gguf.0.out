Okay, let's break this down. This comment is incredibly insightful and raises a lot of serious questions. Here's my take on whether I buy the story, and why:

**My Take: I buy the story, but with a significant amount of skepticism and a need for further investigation.**

Here's a breakdown of why:

* **The Core of the Story - The "Rusty" Butler Incident:** The central narrative – the man who was fired for wearing inappropriate clothing – is undeniably compelling and raises a lot of uncomfortable questions. It’s a classic, albeit dark, story that taps into societal anxieties about appearances and the pressures of the workplace.  It’s a powerful, visceral narrative.

* **The Shadowing Connection:** The fact that the commenter is a former colleague of the award-winning policeman, Chen Da-won, adds a layer of complexity. This suggests a potential connection – perhaps a shared experience, a mutual understanding of the pressures of the job, or even a subtle influence on each other.  This is a *very* interesting detail.

* **The "Vetting" and the Security Concerns:** The details about the vetting process – being "pressed for evidence" and being caught with stolen goods – are deeply concerning. This is a significant red flag.  It suggests a potential for coercion, intimidation, or even a deliberate attempt to disqualify someone.  The security concerns are palpable.

* **The "Some Problems" - The Underlying Issue:** The commenter's statement about Chen Da-won having "some problems" is crucial. It’s not just about the clothing; it’s about a deeper, potentially systemic issue – perhaps a history of problematic behavior, a lack of accountability, or a culture of tolerating misconduct.

**Why I'm skeptical, and why further investigation is needed:**

* **The "Rusty" Butler Story is a Narrative, Not a Definitive Fact:** While the story is gripping, it's a narrative. It's a story that *feels* real, but it's not necessarily verifiable.  It's a dramatic retelling, and it's easy to imagine it being embellished or even fabricated.

* **The Security Concerns are Serious:**  The mention of "vetting" and "stolen goods" is a major red flag.  Police investigations are incredibly sensitive and require rigorous procedures.  The commenter's description raises serious doubts about the integrity of the process.

* **Lack of Context:** We don't know *why* Chen Da-won was dismissed.  Was it a genuine mistake, or was there a more serious underlying issue?  The comment doesn't provide enough context to fully assess the situation.

**What I'd want to know (and what the commenter should do):**

* **What *specifically* is the "some problems" the commenter refers to?**  (Without revealing confidential information, of course.)
* **What was the nature of the "vetting" process?**  (Was it a legitimate investigation, or was it a manipulative tactic?)
* **Has Chen Da-won been formally investigated?** (If so, what were the results?)
* **What is the commenter's relationship to Chen Da-won?** (Are they a close friend, a former colleague, or someone else?)

**In conclusion, the comment is a compelling and unsettling piece of storytelling. It raises legitimate questions about the fairness and integrity of the police system. However, it's crucial to approach this story with a healthy dose of skepticism and demand transparency and accountability.**
