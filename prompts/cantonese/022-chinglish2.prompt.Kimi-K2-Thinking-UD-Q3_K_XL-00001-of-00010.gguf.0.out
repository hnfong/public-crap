The user wants me to translate a conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English. The conversation appears to be in a mix of English and Cantonese slang/abbreviations. Let me break it down line by line.

**Alice:**
- "hah." - just laughter
- "yeh. me 2." - "yeah, me too"
- "I like to play very much gah." - "I like to play very much" (gah is a Cantonese particle)
- "but never gamble lor" - "but never gamble" (lor is a Cantonese particle)
- ":)" - smiley

**Bob:**
- "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" - "oh... I never gamble on big2 either" (big2 is a card game)
- "except for that time a few weeks ago" - clear

**Alice:**
- "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?" - "a few weeks ago with who?" (joe mud = 誰乜 = who, ah is a particle)

**Bob:**
- "went to a friends house" - clear
- "he wanted to play big2 wor" - "he wanted to play big2" (wor is a particle)
- "gum i say play lor" - "so I said okay, let's play" (gum = 咁 = so, lor is a particle)
- "gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)" - "so he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well)"
- "gum I fai si 'so hing' la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..." - "so I thought 'so what'... besides, at most I'd lose something like $10 only..." (fai si = 諗死 = thought, hing = 興 = excitement/interest, la/jeh are particles)

**Alice:**
- "gum yau hai" - "so there is/that's right" (gum = so, yau hai = 有係)
- ":)" - smiley
- "hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - This seems like a typo or very colloquial. Let me think... "lei gor yuun doe" might be "你個原則" (your principle) and "gei moe sor wai" might be "幾冇錯喎" (quite not wrong/not bad). So maybe "your principle is quite right" or "that's quite right of you"
- "it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor" - "it's good actually. but if I really had to gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly" (ngor = I, juun hai = 真係 = really, lor is a particle)

**Bob:**
- "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga..." - "but it's not very good to be so stubborn/resistant" (stand so hard = 企硬 = be firm/resistant, ga is a particle)
- "yea if need to gamble it's very stressful..." - clear
- "btw, do u have the program?" - clear

**Alice:**
- "meh program." - "what program?" (meh = 咩 = what)
- "moe" - "what?" (moe might be a typo for "meh" again)
- "hai ng hai yiu download or sth" - "is it need to download or something" (hai ng hai = 係唔係 = is it, yiu = 要 = need, sth = something)
- ":)" - smiley

**Bob:**
- "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la..." - "so play online of course need to have a program to play" (gum = so, ga la are particles)
- "my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..." - clear

**Alice:**
- "hoe ark." - "okay" (hoe = 好 = good, ark is a particle)
- ":)" - smiley
- "ng goi sai" - "thank you" (唔該晒)
- "hehe" - laughter

Let me reconstruct this in simple English:

Alice: Yeah, me too. I like to play a lot, but never gamble. :)

Bob: Oh... I never gamble on big2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: A few weeks ago with who?

Bob: Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play big2, so I said okay. So he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well). So I thought "so what"... besides, at most I'd lose something like $10 only...

Alice: So that's how it is. :) Hehe. Your principle is quite right. It's good actually. But if I really had to gamble, I would not enjoy the game thoroughly.

Bob: But it's not very good to be so stubborn... yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do you have the program?

Alice: What program? What? Do you need to download it or something? :)

Bob: So to play online of course you need a program... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

Alice: Okay. :) Thanks. Hehe

Wait, let me re-examine some parts more carefully.

"lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - This is tricky. Could be "你個原則幾冇錯喎" meaning "your principle is quite right/not wrong". Or could be something else. Let me think about the context. Bob is talking about not being too stubborn about gambling. Alice seems to be agreeing. So "your principle is quite right" makes sense.

"fai si 'so hing' la" - "諗死'so hing'啦" - "I thought 'so what'". "Hing" here might be excitement, but "so hing" could be "so what/who cares".

Let me refine the translation:

**Alice:**
hah.
yeh. me 2.
I like to play very much gah.
but never gamble lor
:)

-> "Hah. Yeah, me too. I like to play a lot. But never gamble. :)"

**Bob:**
orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)
except for that time a few weeks ago

-> "Oh... I never gamble on big2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago"

**Alice:**
a few weeks ago joe mud ah?

-> "A few weeks ago with who?"

**Bob:**
went to a friends house
he wanted to play big2 wor
gum i say play lor
gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)
gum I fai si "so hing" la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh...

-> "Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play big2, so I said okay. So he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well). So I thought 'so what'... besides, at most I'd lose something like $10 only..."

**Alice:**
gum yau hai
:)
hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai
it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor

-> "So that's how it is. :) Hehe. Your principle is quite right. It's good actually. But if I really had to gamble, I would not enjoy the game thoroughly."

**Bob:**
but it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...
yea if need to gamble it's very stressful...
btw, do u have the program?

-> "But it's not very good to be so stubborn... yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do you have the program?"

**Alice:**
meh program.
moe
hai ng hai yiu download or sth
:)

-> "What program? What? Do you need to download it or something? :)"

**Bob:**
gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la...
my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

-> "So to play online of course you need a program... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..."

**Alice:**
hoe ark.
:)
ng goi sai
hehe

-> "Okay. :) Thanks. Hehe"

Let me make it flow better in simple English:

Alice: Hah. Yeah, me too. I like to play a lot, but never gamble. :)

Bob: Oh... I never gamble on big2 either ;-) except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: A few weeks ago with who?

Bob: Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play big2, so I said okay. Then he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well). So I thought "so what"... besides, at most I'd lose like $10 only...

Alice: So that's how it was. :) Hehe. Your principle is quite right. It's good actually. But if I really had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

Bob: But it's not very good to be so stubborn... yeah, if you need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do you have the program?

Alice: What program? What? Do you need to download it or something? :)

Bob: So to play online you need a program of course... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

Alice: Okay. :) Thanks. Hehe

Actually, let me reconsider some phrases:

"lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" - Could this be "你個原則幾冇錯喎" (your principle is quite not wrong = your principle is quite right)? Yes, that seems right.

"stand so hard" - "企硬" - to be firm, stubborn, inflexible. In this context, Bob is saying it's not good to be
