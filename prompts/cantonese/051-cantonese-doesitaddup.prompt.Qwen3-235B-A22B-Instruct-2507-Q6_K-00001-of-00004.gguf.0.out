No, I don’t “buy” this story — at least, not as a credible or reliable account. Here's why, based on linguistic, logical, and contextual analysis:

---

### 1. **Language and Tone: Highly Suspicious**
- The comment is written in **colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese**, but the **tone is unusually gossipy, personal, and vindictive** for a public forum comment about someone who just received an award.
- It includes **very specific, dramatic details** (e.g., “衰穿櫃桶底” — literally “wore through the bottom of the drawer,” implying misuse of cash or theft; “老細當時仲話你唔即日走的話就報官” — boss said he’d call police if he didn’t leave immediately) — yet **no evidence or sources** are provided.
- The phrase **“唔知點解會過到 vetting 個關”** (“I don’t know how he passed the vetting process”) is particularly telling. It’s **accusatory**, implying the person shouldn’t have been allowed to become a police officer, but offers **zero proof**.

---

### 2. **Lack of Verifiable Details**
- No names of the bank, dates, locations, or other employees are mentioned — **everything is vague** despite claiming to be a firsthand account.
- The story hinges on a **single dramatic incident** in the first week of employment, which supposedly led to immediate firing and police threat — yet **no follow-up or documentation** is referenced.
- If someone were fired for suspected theft and nearly reported to police, that would likely leave a **record or internal HR documentation**, but none is cited.

---

### 3. **Motivation: Possible Smear Campaign**
- The comment appears **motivated by personal animosity or jealousy**, especially given that the person being discussed just received public recognition.
- It’s common in online forums (especially in Hong Kong or Chinese-language communities) for **anonymous users to post unverified, damaging claims** to discredit someone who’s in the spotlight.
- The phrase **“我係呢位優秀學警陳大文銀行前同事”** (“I am a former colleague of this outstanding probationary officer Chan Tai-man”) is a classic **credibility claim without proof** — anyone can say that.

---

### 4. **Logical Inconsistencies**
- If the person was fired for **theft or serious misconduct**, it would be **extremely difficult, if not impossible**, to pass the **strict vetting process** for joining the Hong Kong Police Force — which includes background checks, credit checks, and interviews with former employers.
- The fact that he **became a police officer and received an award** suggests he has a clean record and strong performance — which **contradicts** the claim of being fired for theft.
- If the former boss threatened to call the police, **why wasn’t a report actually filed?** That’s a major red flag. Theft in a bank is a serious crime — it’s unlikely such a case would just end with “packing up and leaving.”

---

### 5. **Possible Alternative Explanations**
- The story could be **exaggerated or fictionalized** based on a minor incident (e.g., a mistake with cash handling, a personality clash).
- “衰穿櫃桶底” might be **hyperbole** — maybe he made a few errors, not actual theft.
- The commenter might be **bitter, envious, or misremembering events** — memory is unreliable, especially over time.

### Conclusion:
❌ **No, this story is not credible.**  
It lacks evidence, contains dramatic unverified claims, and reads more like **anonymous online slander** than a factual account. While it’s *possible* the person had a minor disciplinary issue in the past, the version presented here is **likely exaggerated or false**.

> In matters like this — especially involving public figures or award recipients — **extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence**. This comment provides **zero evidence**.

**Healthy skepticism is warranted.** Unless verified by reliable sources (e.g., news reports, official records), this should be treated as **rumor or hearsay**, not fact. [end of text]
