I would treat the story with a very large pinch of salt.

1. **No verifiable details**  
   - The writer gives no date, no bank name, no department, no supervisor’s name, no incident report number, no newspaper clip, no court record.  
   - “陳大文” itself is the Cantonese equivalent of “John Doe” – a placeholder name that immediately signals the post is anonymous gossip rather than a factual statement.

2. **Timeline does not add up**  
   - To win an “outstanding probationary constable” award the officer must have (a) passed the extended recruitment vetting (six-nine months), (b) finished the 27-week training school, and (c) completed at least half to a full year on probation.  
   - If he really was “escorted out by security in his first week” he would have had to leave the bank, apply for the police, sit the paper-and-physical entrance exams, go through integrity interviews, financial vetting, criminal-record checks, and two more interviews, then wait for an intake slot. That process alone is 12-18 months. The earliest he could possibly be in uniform is a year after the alleged dismissal, so he could not be a “fresh” award winner whose banking exit was only a short while ago. The writer never explains the gap.

3. **Banking HR practice vs. the tale**  
   - A week-one termination for “衰穿櫃桶底” (a slang phrase that can mean anything from petty-cash shortage to forging a signature) would almost certainly be documented and reported to the HKMA and/or the police if there was suspicion of theft. A criminal investigation record would surface in the police’s own vetting and automatically disqualify him.  
   - Large banks do not march you out with security in front of the whole floor unless there is a serious, provable offence. If it was that serious, the poster’s claim that “they didn’t call the police if he left immediately” is implausible: the bank would still file a SAR (suspicious-activity report) and preserve evidence.  
   - If it was not serious enough to report, then it would not have been a “walk-you-out” dismissal either. You cannot have both “they’ll call the police” and “they let him go the same afternoon”.

4. **Police vetting is not trivial**  
   - HKPF checks previous employers, asks for your last employer’s appraisal, and runs a full criminal and financial background search. An unexplained termination for dishonesty from a major bank is exactly the sort of thing that vetting officers flag; applicants are failed for far less.

5. **The language is classic forum innuendo**  
   - “我食完中午返嚟高層就同保安落嚟押住佢執野走” is cinematic but vague: no time, no floor, no eye-witnesses, no paperwork.  
   - “佢個人品有啲問題” is a value judgement, not evidence.  
   - The whole post is constructed to damage reputation without supplying anything that can be cross-checked.

6. **Motive and pattern**  
   - The comment appears under a news thread praising the officer; anonymous “ex-colleagues” who appear only when someone is in the spotlight are a common feature of Hong Kong on-line culture.  
   - Because Hong Kong defamation law is plaintiff-friendly, the poster hides behind “陳大文” so the target cannot sue even if the story is false.

7. **No corroboration**  
   - No other ex-colleague chimes in, no internal e-mail, no Linked-In overlap, no media follow-up. One-sentence “I worked with him” claims are easy to fabricate.

Bottom line: the anecdote is technically possible but, as presented, it is unverifiable, internally inconsistent and statistically unlikely. Without at least a date, a bank, or a verifiable source, it remains unsubstantiated rumour and should be disregarded unless concrete evidence emerges. [end of text]
