The user wants me to translate "Chinglish" phrases (Cantonese written with English pronunciation) into standard Cantonese characters.

 Let me analyze each phrase:

 1. "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah"
    - gor doe = 個度 (there)
    - yau = 有 (have)
    - gor = 個 (classifier)
    - bin = 邊 (which/where)
    - tai lo = 睇路 (look at the road/watch out)
    - ah = 呀 (particle)
    => 個度有個邊睇路呀？ or maybe 個度有個邊睇路呀
    Wait, "tai lo" could also be "睇樓" (viewing property) or just "睇路" (watching the road)
    Actually looking at context: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" -> "個度有個邊睇路呀" (There's a side there to watch the road?)
    Or maybe: "個度有個邊睇樓呀" (There's a side there to view the property?)
    Or: "個度有個邊睇囉呀" (There's a side to watch there, right?)
    Actually "tai lo" might be "睇樓" (property viewing). But "bin tai lo" is a bit odd.
    Wait, could be: "個度有個邊睇路呀" -> meaning "Is there a side there to watch the road?"
    Or simpler: "個度有個邊睇囉呀" (There's a side to watch, right?)
    Actually, looking at the pattern, "tai lo" = "睇樓" (viewing property/showflat) makes sense in HK context.
    "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there)
    "yau gor bin" = 有個邊 (have a side/there's a side)
    Hmm, "bin" could be 邊 (where/which) or 邊 (side).
    Actually: "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" = "嗰度有個邊睇樓呀" (There's a side there for property viewing?)
    Or: "嗰度有個邊睇路呀" (There's a side there to watch the road?)
    Let me reconsider. "tai lo" could be "睇囉" (just watch/look).
    "gor doe yau gor bin" = "嗰度有個邊" (there is a side there)
    Maybe: "嗰度有個邊睇樓呀" (There's a side there for viewing the building?)
    Actually, looking at HK Cantonese romanization patterns:
    - "gor" = 個
    - "doe" = 度
    - "yau" = 有
    - "gor" = 個
    - "bin" = 邊 (which/where) or 邊 (side)
    - "tai" = 睇
    - "lo" = 樓 or 囉 or 路
    
    Maybe: "嗰度有個邊睇樓呀" (There's a side there to view the property?)
    Or: "嗰度有個邊睇路呀" (There's a side there to watch the road?)
    
    Actually, "tai lo" is likely "睇樓" (property viewing) in Hong Kong context.
    "gor doe" = 嗰度 (there)
    "yau gor bin" = 有個邊 (have a side)
    Wait, "bin" might be 便 (side) as in "呢便" (this side) vs "嗰便" (that side).
    So: "嗰度有個便睇樓呀" (There's a side there for property viewing?)
    
    Or maybe: "嗰度有個邊度睇樓呀" -> "嗰度有個邊度睇樓呀" (Where is there to view property there?)
    No, that doesn't fit the "yau" (have).
    
    Let me try: "嗰度有個邊睇路呀" -> "嗰度有個邊睇路呀" (There's a side there to watch the road?)
    
    Actually, looking at the sentence structure, it might be: "嗰度有個邊睇樓呀" meaning "There's a side there for property viewing, right?"
    
    But I'm not entirely sure. Let me look at the others first to get a pattern.

 2. "ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?"
    - ngor = 我 (I)
    - ng sik = 唔識 (don't know)
    - use = use (English)
    - fai zi = 妃子 (concubine?) or 快啲 (faster)? No, "fai zi" = 快啲 (faster/quickly) -> no, that's "fai di"
    - "fai zi" = 快啲? No.
    - "fai zi" = 筷子 (chopsticks)!
    - gah = 㗎 (particle)
    - use chi gang = 用筷子 (use chopsticks)
    - duck = 得 (can/okay) or 特? "duck ng duck" = 得唔得 (is it okay/can you)
    => 我唔識用筷子㗎，用筷子得唔得？
    (I don't know how to use chopsticks, is it okay to use [them]?)
    Or: "我唔識用快啲㗎" -> no.
    "fai zi" is definitely 筷子 (chopsticks).
    "chi gang" = 支梗? No, "chi gang" = 支棍? No.
    Wait, "use chi gang" = 用支羹 (use a spoon)?
    "chi gang" = 支羹 (spoon).
    So: "我唔識用筷子㗎，用支羹得唔得？"
    (I don't know how to use chopsticks, is it okay to use a spoon?)
    That makes sense!

 3. "mud yeah lei ga?"
    - mud = 乜 (what)
    - yeah = 嘢 (thing/stuff)
    - lei = 嚟 (come)
    - ga = 㗎 (particle)
    => 乜嘢嚟㗎？ (What is this?/What stuff is this?)

 4. "but yuu yat chai yum cha lah"
    - but yuu = 不如 (might as well/better to)
    - yat chai = 一齊 (together)
    - yum cha = 飲茶 (drink tea/dim sum)
    - lah = 啦 (particle)
    => 不如一齊飲茶啦 (Might as well have dim sum together)

 5. "gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu"
    - gor = 個 (classifier)
    - send jor = 送咗/send咗 (sent)
    - hui = 去 (to)
    - nei = 你 (your)
    - gor = 個 (classifier)
    - yahoo email = Yahoo email (transliterated)
    - lu = 囉 (particle)
    => 個password send咗去你個Yahoo email囉 (The password was sent to your Yahoo email)
    Or: 個密碼 send咗去你個Yahoo email囉
    But they want Cantonese characters, and "password" and "email" might stay as is or be translated.
    Actually, in Chinglish translation to Cantonese, we usually write the Cantonese parts in characters and keep English loanwords or translate them.
    But the instruction says "translate into Cantonese", so probably:
    個密碼 send咗去你個 Yahoo email 囉
    Or keep "password" and "email" as is since they're English words in the original.
    But "password" could be 密碼, "email" could be 電郵.
    However, since the original uses English words, and this is Chinglish (code-mixing), I should probably provide the Cantonese character equivalent for the Cantonese parts, and either keep or translate the English parts.
    Looking at the examples:
    - "nei ho" => 你好 (no English)
    - "nei yau moe tai sing con ah?" => 你有冇睇歌唱比賽呀？ (no English)
    So they want everything in Cantonese characters.
    So: 個密碼 send 咗去你個 Yahoo 電郵囉
    Or: 個密碼傳咗去你個 Yahoo 電郵囉
    But "send" is often written as "send" or "傳" in Cantonese writing.
    Actually, looking at the style, they might want:
    個密碼 send 咗去你個 Yahoo email 囉
    Or fully Cantonese: 個密碼傳咗去你個雅虎電郵囉
    But "Yahoo" is a brand name.
    I'll provide: 個密碼 send 咗去你個 Yahoo 電郵囉
    Or: 個密碼傳咗去你個 Yahoo 電郵囉

 6. "farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga"
    - farn hok = 返學 (go to school)
    - ho sun fu = 好辛苦 (very hard/tough)
    - lor = 囉 (particle)
    - gei si = 幾時 (when)
    - sin = 先 (first/only then)
    - fong = 放 (release/dismiss)
    - ga = 㗎 (particle)
    => 返學好辛苦囉，幾時先放㗎 (Going to school is very tough, when will [we] be dismissed?)
    Or: 返學好辛苦囉，幾時先放假㗎 (When will we have a holiday?)
    "fong" could be 放學 (dismiss from school) or 放假 (holiday).
    "fong ga" -> 放㗎 (dismissed?)
    "gei si sin fong ga" = 幾時先放㗎 (When will it be released/dismissed?)
    Probably: 返學好辛苦囉，幾時先放學㗎 (Going to school is tough, when will school end?)
    Or: 返學好辛苦囉，幾時先放假㗎 (Going to school is tough, when will we have a holiday?)

 7. "yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok..."
    - yau chin = 有錢 (have money)
    - lar = 啦 (particle)
    - daap dik = 答得 (can answer)
    - si = 試 (exam/test) or 事 (matter)?
    - farn hok = 返學 (go to school)
    => 有錢啦，答得試返學... (Have money now, can answer the test and go to school...)
    That doesn't make sense.
    "daap dik si" = 答啲試? (answer the test)
    Or: "daap dik si" = 搭的士 (take a taxi)!
    "farn hok" = 返學 (go to school)
    => 有錢啦，搭的士返學... (Have money now, take a taxi to go to school...)
    That makes sense!

 8. "kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung"
    - kui = 佢 (he/she)
    - doe = 度 (there/place) or 都 (also)?
    - 9 = 九 (nine) or "gau" sound?
    - ng = 唔 (not)
    - connect = connect (English)
    - 8 = 八 (eight) or "baat" sound?
    - ge = 嘅 (possessive/particle)
    - man = 問 (ask)
    - kui = 佢 (him/her)
    - yat yeung = 一樣 (same)
    - yeah = 嘢 (thing/stuff)
    - kui = 佢 (he/she)
    - jau = 就 (then)
    - darp = 答 (answer)
    - dai = 大 (big)
    - yeung = 樣 (appearance/like)
    => 佢度九唔connect八嘅，問佢一樣嘢佢就答大樣
    "9 ng connect 8" = 九唔搭八 (nonsensical/not making sense/irrelevant)
    "darp dai yeung" = 答大樣 (answer arrogantly/with attitude)?
    Actually "darp dai yeung" = 搭大樣? No.
    "darp" = 答 (answer)
    "dai yeung" = 大樣 (arrogant look/attitude)
    So: 佢度九唔搭八嘅，問佢一樣嘢佢就答大樣
    Or: 佢都九唔搭八嘅...
    "kui doe" = 佢度 (he there?) or 佢都 (he also)?
    "佢都九唔搭八嘅" (He's also talking nonsense/irrelevant)
    "問佢一樣嘢佢就答大樣" (Ask him one thing and he answers arrogantly)
    That makes sense.

 9. "need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju"
    - need = need (English)
    - boot = boot/reboot?
    - gei = 機 (machine)
    - wait = wait (English)
    - me = me (English) or 我?
    - ng hoe = 唔好 (don't/not good)
    - hoi chi = 開啟 (start/open)?
    - ju = 住 (particle)
    => Need boot機，wait我，唔好開啟住
    Or: 需要 reboot 機，等我，唔好開啟住
    "boot gei" =  reboot 機 (reboot the computer)
    "ng hoe" = 唔好 (don't)
    "hoi chi" = 開啟 (start up/boot up)
    "ju" = 住 (indicating continuous state)
    => 要 reboot 機，等我，唔好開機住
    Or: Need reboot 機，wait 我，唔好開機住
    But probably translate to full Cantonese:
    要 reboot 機，等我，唔好開機住
    Or: 要重新開機，等我，唔好開住部機

 10. "yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai"
     - yap sat = 廿七 (27)? No, "yap" = 入 (enter)?
     - "yap sat" = 一七? No.
     - "yap sat" = 廿七 (27)? No, that's "ya sat".
     - "yap" = 入 (enter)
     - "sat" = 室 (room)?
     - "yim sat" = 驗室 (laboratory)?
     - "yap sat yim sat" = 入實驗室 (enter the laboratory)?
     - "gum" = 咁 (so)
     - "gan gap" = 緊急 (urgent)
     - "zai" = 仔 (son/small) or 哉 (particle)?
     => 入實驗室咁緊急仔?
     That doesn't make sense.
     "zai" could be 咋 (only/just).
     => 入實驗室咁緊急咋 (Entering the lab is so urgent?)
     
     Alternative:
     "yap sat" = 一七 (17)?
     "yim sat" = 驗室?
     
     Wait: "yap sat yim sat" = 入實驗室 (enter laboratory)
     "gum gan gap" = 咁緊急 (so urgent)
     "zai" = 咋 (only/just)
     => 入實驗室咁緊急咋 (It's just entering the lab, why so urgent?)
     Or: 入實驗室咁緊急咩 (Is entering the lab so urgent?)
     But "zai" is usually 咋.
     
     Or: "yap sat" = 二十 (20)? No, that's "yi sap".
     
     Another thought:
     "yap sat" = 一七 (one seven)?
     "yim sat" = 驗室 (lab)?
     
     Actually: "yap sat yim sat" = 入實驗室 (enter the laboratory)
     "gum gan gap zai" = 咁緊急咋 (so urgent only/just)
     => 入實驗室咁緊急咋 (Entering the lab is just so urgent?)
     Or: 入實驗室咁緊急仔 (Entering the lab is such an urgent thing?)
     
     Wait, "zai" could be 仔 (diminutive), but at the end of sentence it's often 咋.
     
     Or: "yap sat yim sat" = 一七驗室? No.
     
     Let me reconsider "yap sat". Could be "二十" (yi sap) but written as "yap sat"? No.
     Could be "十" (sap) but "yap" is 入.
     
     Actually: "yap sat yim sat" = 入實驗室 (enter laboratory) makes the most sense.
     "gum gan gap" = 咁緊急 (so urgent)
     "zai" = 咋 (particle)
     
     So: 入實驗室咁緊急咋 (Entering the laboratory is so urgent, that's all/only)
     Or: 入實驗室咁緊急咩 (Is entering the lab so urgent?)
     But "zai" is 咋.
     
     Or "zai" = 仔, meaning "guy" or diminutive.
     "緊急仔" = urgent guy? No.
     
     Maybe: "入實驗室咁緊急者" (Entering the lab is so urgent, you know)
     
     I'll go with: 入實驗室咁緊急咋

 Now back to 1:
