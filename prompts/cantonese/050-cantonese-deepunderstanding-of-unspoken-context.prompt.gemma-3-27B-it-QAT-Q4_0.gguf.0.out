Okay, let's break down this paragraph. Here's a critique, covering the situation, problems, and conclusion, followed by my agreement/disagreement. I'll answer in English for clarity, but I'll include some Cantonese phrasing where relevant to highlight the tone.

**Overview of the Situation (Objective)**

The person writing this is a working-class individual – he explicitly states he started working at age 13 ("阿叔我13歲已經出嚟做嘢"). He's observing a current trend where attractive people ("靚仔靚妹") are complaining about difficulty finding jobs. He's likely in a more traditional, perhaps manual labor, field of work, given his acceptance of "辛苦污糟冇前景人工低" (hard, dirty, no future, low pay) jobs.  He's likely older and has a pragmatic, no-nonsense view of the job market.

**Problems He Identifies**

The core problem he sees isn't a lack of job *offers*, but a mismatch between *people's expectations and their qualifications*. He highlights several specific issues:

* **Cash Payment Preference:** He's puzzled by companies offering cash payments ("現金糧") to attract workers, implying he thinks this is a superficial solution. He questions why companies need to resort to this tactic.
* **Lack of Basic Qualifications:** He points out that many job seekers lack experience ("冇經驗") and education ("冇學歷").  He believes this makes them less employable. ("憑咩人哋請你？" - What makes them think someone *should* hire them?)
* **Unrealistic Expectations:** He believes people are complaining about jobs that he himself would readily accept, jobs that are physically demanding, low-paying, and lack career advancement.  He frames this as a problem of entitlement.
* **The Root Cause:** He firmly believes the issue isn't the jobs themselves, but the *people* applying for them. ("唔係公司舖頭offer唔夠係根本上啲人有問題" - The problem isn't the job offers, it's the people themselves.)

**Why He Thinks These Problems Exist**

He implicitly suggests a shift in work ethic and a disconnect between expectations and reality. He seems to believe younger generations (or at least those he's observing) are less willing to accept less-desirable jobs, even if those jobs are available.  He's seen a lot of the job market and believes people need to be realistic about what they can offer.  He's likely seen a time when people were more willing to take *any* job to get started.

**Do I Agree with His Conclusion?**

I partially agree with his conclusion, but it's an oversimplification. He's right to point out that qualifications and expectations play a huge role.  It's true that a lack of experience and education *will* limit job options.  His experience ("阿叔" implies a long working life) gives him a valid perspective on the value of hard work and accepting less-than-ideal conditions.

However, to say "根本上啲人有問題" (the people are the problem) is too harsh and ignores systemic issues. Here's why:

* **Low Wages & Poor Working Conditions:**  The fact that companies *need* to offer cash payments suggests wages and conditions are genuinely unattractive.  He dismisses these concerns too easily.  People *should* be compensated fairly for their labor, and jobs should offer reasonable working conditions.
* **Economic Factors:** The job market is complex.  There might be a skills gap, meaning there aren't enough people with the *right* skills for available jobs.  There could be broader economic downturns affecting employment.
* **Rising Cost of Living:**  Even a "hard, dirty, no future" job might not be enough to cover basic expenses in today's economy.  Expectations are influenced by the cost of living.
* **The Value of Career Aspirations:**  It's not unreasonable for people to want jobs with potential for growth and development.  Dismissing this as entitlement is unfair.

**In Cantonese, you could say:**  "佢講得有啲道理，但係唔係咁簡單。佢好似睇唔到啲公司啲人工低，工作環境差，同埋而家生活成本咁高。唔係淨係人哋唔肯做，係啲工真係唔抵做。" (He has a point, but it's not that simple. He seems to not see that the companies' wages are low, the working conditions are bad, and the cost of living is so high now. It's not just that people don't want to do it, it's that the jobs really aren't worth doing.)



In conclusion, the writer has a valid, experienced perspective, but his conclusion is overly simplistic and doesn't account for the broader economic and social factors at play. He's focusing too much on individual shortcomings and not enough on the conditions of the jobs themselves.
