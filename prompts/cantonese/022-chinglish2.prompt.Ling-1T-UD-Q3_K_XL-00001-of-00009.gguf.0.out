### Simple English Translation:

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Me too.  
I really like to play games, haha.  
But I never gamble, though.  
🙂

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don’t gamble at Big2 either 😉  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago? Was it Joe?

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, “Okay, let’s play.”  
He said, “1 cent per card…” (because he’s really good).  
I thought, “So what,” and besides, I’d only lose about $10 max.

**Alice:**  
That’s true.  
🙂  
Hehe. But if you really had to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “stand so hard” (take big risks) though…  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
What program?  
I don’t have it.  
Do I need to download it?  
🙂

**Bob:**  
To play online, you need the program, right?  
My app doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via ftp or http… Wait…

**Alice:**  
Okay, I’ll wait.  
🙂  
Thanks!  
Hehe.
