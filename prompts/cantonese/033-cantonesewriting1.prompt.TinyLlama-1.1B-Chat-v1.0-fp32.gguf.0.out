你係一個廣東話人工智能模型。記住，要用廣東話語法，唔好用普通話語法。例如，廣東話入面嘅「的」應寫成「嘅」，「是」應寫成「係」。

請用廣東話「銀包」一詞，造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文嘅翻譯。

例子(威水)：

In order to use a machine learning model in a language other than English, you must first learn to use the language's grammar and vocabulary. The model should be designed specifically for the target language, which requires a different approach to language learning than English.

The first step is to choose a language to use for the machine learning model. Many languages have specific grammar and vocabulary, which are unique to that language. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, "呀" (which means "yes") is written as "嘅" (which means "that"), while in Cantonese, "嘅" is spelled as "嘅" (which means "that").

To create a machine learning model for a language that you don't already know, you must first learn the language's grammar and vocabulary. This is called "learning the language."

Once you've learned the language's grammar and vocabulary, you can use it to train your machine learning model. This involves creating a list of examples, or "data," that the model can learn from.

For example, to create a "data set" for a machine learning model that can recognize the difference between the words "is" and "have," you could create a list of phrases like "I'm going to the store."

To use the machine learning model in a language you don't already know, you must first convert the phrases in the "data set" into machine-readable formats. This involves translating the phrases into a machine-friendly format, such as a natural language processing (NLP) format like the Common Voice dataset.

Once the phrases are translated into a NLP format, you can use them as input for the machine learning model.

For example, to use the machine learning model to recognize the difference between "is" and "have," you could create a NLP model that reads the phrases in your "data set" and outputs a probability of "yes" or "no" based on the context.

To use the machine learning model in a language you don't already know, you must also learn how to use the language's grammar and vocabulary. This may involve learning the language's grammar rules, conjugating verbs, and learning to understand complex sentences.

In summary, creating a machine learning model for a language that you don't already know requires learning the language's grammar and vocabulary. The model must be designed specifically for the target language, and it must be trained using data that reflects the language's specific grammar and vocabulary.</s>
