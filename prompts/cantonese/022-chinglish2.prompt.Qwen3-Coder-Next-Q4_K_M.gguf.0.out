## Alice:  
Ha!  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing, but I never gamble. 😊  

## Bob:  
Oh… I never gamble on Big2 either 😉  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

## Alice:  
A few weeks ago—Joe Mud, right?  

## Bob:  
I went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, so I said, “Sure, let’s play!”  
He said, “1 cent per card” (because he’s really good at it).  
I thought, “Oh no, this is serious!” 😅  
But anyway, at most I’d lose around $10, so…  

## Alice:  
Oh, I see. 😊  
Hehe. You really went for it!  
Actually, it’s fine—but if I had to gamble, I wouldn’t fully enjoy the game.  

## Bob:  
But it’s not good to “stand your ground” too firmly, right?  
Yeah, gambling can be very stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?  

## Alice:  
What program?  
Hmm…  
I don’t know if I downloaded it or something. 😊  

## Bob:  
Well, to play online, you obviously need a program, right?  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP… Wait…  

## Alice:  
Okay. 😊  
I’ll try.  
Hehe. [end of text]
