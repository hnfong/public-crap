## Alice and Bob's Conversation (Simplified English)

**Alice:** Haha, yeah, me too. I like to play a lot. But I never gamble. :)

**Bob:** Yeah, I don't gamble on Big2 either, except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:** A few weeks ago? Who was it with?

**Bob:** I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2, so I said okay. He said he wanted to play for 1 cent per card because he's really good. I thought, "Why not?" Besides, at most I could lose about $10.

**Alice:** Okay, that's fine. :)
Hehe, it's actually good. But if you gamble too much, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:** But it's not good to be too serious about it. Yeah, gambling can be stressful. By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:** The program? You can download it or something. :)

**Bob:** Of course, you need a program to play online. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:** Okay. :)
I'll try.
Hehe.
