I'm thinking about how to present the pronunciation for "副簽." I could use "fu3 cim1" or "fu3 caam1," but I want to be careful. The user didn't specifically ask for the pronunciation, so I might skip it. However, including it could be helpful. I need to ensure I follow the format strictly, using the header "# 副簽" and the explanation in the specified style. I'll also include the example sentence in Cantonese.

I'm considering how to present the example sentence for "副簽." I could use "副簽" in a sentence like "呢份合約要副簽先有效," which means "This contract needs a countersignature to be valid." I want to ensure the explanation is clear and concise, so I’ll say something like "yue:文件、合同等需要由第二個人簽名先有效（量詞：個）" and "eng:countersignature." I’ll also include the example sentence in Cantonese, ensuring it follows the specified format.
