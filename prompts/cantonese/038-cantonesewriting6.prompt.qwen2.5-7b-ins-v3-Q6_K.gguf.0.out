Alright, I need to translate the provided Cantonese words into sentences using proper Cantonese grammar. The user has specified that certain characters should be replaced with their Cantonese equivalents, such as changing "的" to "嘅" and "是" to "係". I'll start by examining each word and determining how to construct a natural-sounding sentence in Cantonese.

First, I'll look at the list of words:

9. **各為其主**: Each person acts in the interest of their own master or superior.
10. **軨蓋**: Another term for a train cover.
11. **打哥夫**: Playing golf.
12. **免揀**: Referring to products that are not selectable by customers.
13. **擺闊佬**: Showing off wealth or a lavish demeanor.
14. **廣播劇**: Continuous dramas broadcast on radio.
15. **錄影機**: A machine used for recording videos.
16. **吟詩吟唔甩**: Indicates that the evidence is conclusive and cannot be denied.
17. **佈道大會**: A religious preaching conference.

19. **寫手**: A person who writes on behalf of others.
20. **代打**: Playing in place of another person.
21. **茶碗**: A bowl used for drinking tea, often associated with Japanese tea ceremony.
22. **茶隔**: A tool used to separate tea leaves from tea broth.
23. **只許州官放火，不准百姓點燈**: A metaphor indicating that those in power can act freely while common people are restricted.
24. **獨唱**: Singing alone without accompaniment.
25. **快人快事**: Describing someone who does things quickly and efficiently.
26. **四腳獸**: A term used to describe two people engaging in intimate activities in a public restroom.
