The story shared in the forum comment raises several points that could be considered unusual or questionable, which might lead one to be skeptical about its authenticity. Here are some aspects to consider:

1. **Shadowing and Termination**: It's not uncommon for new employees to be shadowed by more experienced colleagues, but being terminated within the first week is quite rare, especially for a reason as minor as "sloppy work" (衰穿櫃桶底). Most companies have a probation period longer than a week to assess new hires.

2. **Threat of Legal Action**: The claim that the employer threatened to report the individual to the police if they didn't leave immediately is unusual. Typically, employment disputes are handled through internal processes or civil litigation, not criminal complaints.

3. **Immediate Removal**: The description of being escorted out by security and high-level executives seems exaggerated. While some companies do have strict policies, such a dramatic response to a minor issue seems unlikely.

4. **Transition to Police**: The transition from being fired from a bank to becoming a police officer is possible but would require passing a rigorous vetting process. The comment suggests that the individual had "personal issues" but still passed this process, which could be seen as improbable.

5. **Vetting Process**: The vetting process for becoming a police officer is typically thorough, involving background checks, interviews, and assessments. The comment implies that despite personal issues, the individual passed this process, which might raise questions about the thoroughness of the vetting.

Overall, while the story could be true, the circumstances described seem unusual and might warrant skepticism. It would be important to consider the credibility of the source and any additional context or evidence that could support or refute the claims. [end of text]
