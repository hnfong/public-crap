 Alice:
Haha, yeah.
Me too. I really like to play games. I've never gambled though.

Bob:
Oh, I've never gambled on Big Two either, except for that time a few weeks ago...

Alice:
Was that at Joe's place?

Bob:
Yeah, I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I agreed to play. He said one cent for a card, because he's really good. I thought, "That's not too bad," because even if I lost, it would only be about $10.

Alice:
That's not so bad.
Hehe, you're quite brave to take that risk. It's good actually, but if you're gambling, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

Bob:
But it's not good to be too stubborn. If you have to gamble, it can be very stressful. By the way, do you have the program?

Alice:
What program? The one you download or something?

Bob:
Oh, if you want to play online, you need a program to play. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP. Wait...

Alice:
Okay, thanks!
Hehe. [end of text]
