## Rewritten Essay:

I was browsing the internet three hours after finishing work and saw people mourning #YuYingshi. At the time, I only knew he was an idol of blogger and professor #WangWeixiong, and knew nothing else about his life.

However, in the 21st century, you don’t always need to ask #teachers for everything. Google knows all. After a bit of research, I began to understand why he was so famous, and why Professor Wang mentions him so often…

Old Master Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive is that! Just the name alone is intimidating!

I started obsessively digging into Yu Yingshi’s background: what does Chinese Wikipedia say about him, what does English Wikipedia say, how did people praise him when he won awards, and what do obituaries say about him today? A person I deeply respect came to mind… Teacher Yun Gen. They’re actually quite similar!

It’s a shame Teacher Yun Gen doesn’t have a professorship at Harvard, but their #extensive knowledge of history and culture, and their #I-am-China traditional Chinese skills are definitely cut from the same cloth. Teacher Yun Gen likes Daoism and Buddhism, while Old Master Yu seems to be a fan of Confucianism.

But that’s a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, hierarchical order, and respect for rulers and ministers. But if you study at a top American university, having just earned your PhD during the height of the hippie movement, are you really going to go around teaching everyone to #respect teachers and avoid #individualism? That would be foolish.

Let’s talk about how scholars avoid being foolish. That’s the knowledge Confucius gained through a lifetime of hardship. Confucian students couldn’t have been unaware: in Confucius’s time, the country was on the verge of chaos. He traveled around the states, hoping to find an official position and achieve something great. But he only knew how to recite texts and talk about the rites of the Zhou dynasty, and didn’t know how to cater to the needs of his superiors, ultimately failing. However, failure is the mother of success, and his students improved greatly. As Sima Qian said, “The seventy disciples scattered among the various states, the greater ones becoming ministers and advisors, the lesser ones teaching scholars and officials.” Why?

Because, after generations of transmission, they began to read the intentions of rulers. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with rulers were already different, filled with conversation and laughter, knowing how to flatter his superiors: “King Qi, I see you are even unwilling to kill an ox, you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the Way, and you will succeed!”

By the late Warring States period, “Confucian” strategists playing the game of “ruler interviews” had reached a masterful level. In order to gain office, “benevolence” and “propriety” were abandoned, and everyone went to study “rule of law” – this new technology. So Xunzi, as a Confucian disciple, could train students who became high-ranking officials in the Qin Dynasty government. You wouldn’t smell a trace of Confucius’s spirit in Li Si.

Today, with nearly two hundred countries in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than during the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants leaving China, the (ancient) land of rites and propriety, to the barbaric land of military superpower America, are they really going to pull out a copy of the *Analects* and call for #three years of mourning? Everyone is familiar with how humiliated Confucius and his students were when they were repeatedly denied audiences. So, when they arrive in America, Confucian disciples naturally say that the Master supports #democracy, #democracy is great, and the Communist Party is terrible, that’s how you get an Ivy League professorship!

Some might ask: are there no consequences for such nonsense? Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and Confucian tradition was shattered during the #May Fourth Movement. As the sole superpower after World War II, the academic authority of top universities can believe anything – you could say Johnny Kung teaches people to do drugs and sleep around, and people might believe it. After all, America’s #theoretical nuclear weapons are real, and the consequences for Japan not believing that are still fresh in everyone’s memory.

So why could Old Master Yu casually translate a few lines from *Hanshu* (Book of Han) into English and get a PhD, and then be offered professorships at several universities? #You understand. Elevating you to the status of an authority is to get you to earnestly say: “Everyone here is a fool. You think Confucian thought is feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, he was a champion of democracy! If you don’t have a Harvard professorship, just listen to me!”

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy? Honestly, “sinologists” don’t know what they’re talking about. You say: the Republic of China is an example. But hey, is Taiwan’s political system really “Confucian”? The KMT bosses constantly attack Tsai Ing-wen, is that how Confucianism works? Does Tsai Ing-wen perform elaborate rituals to worship heaven and earth? No. Scientific spirit, avoiding superstition, violates the tenets of Confucianism. Do you think using Chinese characters equals Confucianism? Do you think Confucianism only exists in China?

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least, among the most advanced countries in the world, they are the closest to Confucianism): rulers emphasize etiquette and ceremony, power is bestowed by heaven and is supreme, untouchable, everyone is in a hierarchical order, and there is no challenging the system, which stabilizes society. As for the successes and failures of their democratic systems, that’s not something an American-born Chinese person is qualified to comment on.



## Commentary:

Disregarding the sarcastic and often provocative tone, the author’s main point is a critique of the *adaptation* – and arguably, *distortion* – of Confucianism when transplanted to a Western context, specifically within American academia. 

The author argues that Confucian ideals are often strategically reinterpreted to align with Western values (particularly democracy and individualism) in order to make them palatable and acceptable to an American audience. This isn't necessarily a genuine engagement with Confucian thought, but rather a performance designed to secure academic positions and maintain authority. 

The essay suggests that the pursuit of academic success and power incentivizes scholars to present a version of Confucianism that is convenient and appealing to Western sensibilities, even if it fundamentally alters its original meaning. The author implies that Yu Yingshi’s success is a product of this dynamic, and that his scholarship may be shaped by a need to conform to American expectations.

Ultimately, the author is questioning the authenticity of “Confucianism” as it is presented and understood in the West, and suggesting that it has become a tool for self-promotion and political maneuvering rather than a genuine philosophical pursuit. They highlight the historical pragmatism within Confucianism itself – the ability to adapt to changing circumstances – but suggest that the current adaptation has gone too far, sacrificing core principles for the sake of acceptance. The author also subtly critiques the arrogance of assuming a position of authority on a complex tradition without fully understanding its nuances.
