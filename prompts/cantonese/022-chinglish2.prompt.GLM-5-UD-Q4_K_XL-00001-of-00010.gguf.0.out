The following is a conversation between Alice and Bob translated into simple English.

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah. Me too.
I really like to play, you know.
But I never gamble.
:)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big Two either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
What happened a few weeks ago?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
So I said, let's play.
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he plays very well).
So I thought, "sure thing"... besides, at most I'd lose something like $10...

**Alice:**
I see.
:)
Hehe. Your friend is quite tricky.
It's good actually. But if I really have to gamble, I would not enjoy the game thoroughly.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so stubborn...
Yeah, if you have to gamble it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program?
No.
Do I need to download something?
:)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online, of course you need to have a program...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

**Alice:**
That's a hassle.
:)
Thanks a lot.
Hehe. [end of text]
