Okay, here's a rewrite of the essay into English, aiming for clarity and readability while retaining the original's argumentative structure. I've tried to capture the nuances of the original without directly translating phrases.

**The Pragmatism of Scholarship: A Reflection on Yu Ying-Shih**

Three hours ago, I got off work and was browsing the internet when I saw people mourning #YuYingshi. At the time, I only knew he was a figure admired by Professor Wang Wei-hung, a prominent blogger, and I knew nothing else about his life.

But in the 21st century, you don't always need to consult a #teacher. Google knows everything. After a bit of research, I began to understand why he was so renowned and why Professor Wang spoke of him with such reverence.

Yu Ying-Shih taught at *three* Ivy League universities! That's impressive, isn't it? Just the association is enough to be intimidating.

I started obsessively researching Yu Ying-Shih’s background: how the Chinese Wikipedia wrote about him, how the English Wikipedia wrote about him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how obituaries described him today. A figure I deeply respect came to mind: my teacher, Yun Gen. They’re quite similar, actually!

Sadly, Yun Gen didn't have a Harvard chair, but their shared mastery of classical Chinese learning – their ability to draw on the wisdom of the past and embody the spirit of Chinese civilization – is certainly comparable. Yun Gen favored Daoism and Buddhism; Yu Ying-Shih seemed to be a Confucian fan.

But that’s where the trouble lies.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness; respect for elders and superiors; and a clear hierarchy. But if you’re teaching at a top American university, having just returned with a PhD from the height of the hippie era, are you really going to preach about #respectingteachers and discouraging #individualism? That would be ridiculous.

The art of a scholar avoiding such awkwardness – of appearing relevant and not out of touch – is a lesson Confucius spent a lifetime trying to learn, and one that Confucian students would certainly know. In Confucius’s time, the world was on the brink of chaos. He traveled from state to state, hoping to secure a position and achieve something significant. But he only knew how to recite the *Zhou Rituals*, unable to cater to the needs of rulers. He ultimately failed. However, failure is the mother of success, and his students progressed considerably. As Sima Qian said, "The seventy disciples scattered among the feudal lords, some becoming high officials and advisors, others teachers of scholars and gentlemen." Why?

Because, over generations, they began to read the expressions on the faces of rulers. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with monarchs were different – more conversational, more engaging, knowing how to flatter the boss: "King, I see that you are so reluctant to slaughter even a single cow; you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the Way, and you will prosper!"

By the Warring States period, Confucian strategists had perfected the game of "interviewing" rulers. To secure positions, they abandoned "benevolence" and "propriety," focusing instead on the new technology of "rule of law." Thus, Xunzi, a Confucian disciple, trained students who could become high-ranking officials in the Qin government. You wouldn't find a trace of Confucius in Li Si.

Today, the United Nations comprises hundreds of countries, and the situation is far more complex than in the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian scholars, leaving behind China – that ancient land of ritual and propriety – have ventured into the wild, barbaric territory of militarily dominant America. Are they really going to pull out the *Analects* and demand that people #observethreeyearsmourning? Confucius and his students were famously turned away with closed doors. So, when in America, a Confucian must say that Confucius supports #democracy, #democracyisgreat, down with the Communist Party and its descendants, because that's how you get a position at an Ivy League university.

Someone might ask: Does it really matter what you say? Of course, it does! Confucius and Mencius died thousands of years ago, and Confucian traditions were largely destroyed during the #MayFourthMovement. As the sole academic authority of the post-World War II superpower, if you were to say that Yu Ying-Shih taught people to take drugs and play with women, people might actually believe you. After all, American #theoreticalnuclearweapons are incredibly powerful, and the consequences of the Japanese refusing to believe it were clear for all to see.

That’s why Yu Ying-Shih was able to casually translate a few passages from the *Book of Han* into English and obtain a PhD, and why several universities hired him as a professor. #Yougetit.  The goal of elevating you to a pedestal as an authority is to have you confidently declare, "Those of you sitting here are just ducks – you think Confucian thought is feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! In fact, he was a true democrat! Obey your teacher and listen to what he says if you don't have a Harvard chair!"

As for whether Confucian thought is inherently in conflict with democracy? Frankly, that’s something a “Sinologist” knows how to navigate. You could say: "The Republic of China is an example." Come on, man! Are Taiwan’s political elites “Confucian”? The Kuomintang politicians are constantly insulting Tsai Ing-wen. Is that how Confucianism is practiced? Has Tsai Ing-wen made any elaborate sacrifices to the heavens? No. Embracing scientific principles and avoiding superstition is in line with Confucian teachings. You think using Chinese characters means you’re Confucian? You think Confucianism can only exist in China?

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least, it’s the most Confucian of the advanced nations). A ruler emphasizes ceremony and display, power is bestowed by heaven, supreme and unassailable, not to be questioned; there's a clear hierarchy, and challenges to it are not permitted. The success or failure of their democratic systems is not something a Chinese-American is qualified to comment on.

**Commentary: The Main Point**

Disregarding the sarcastic and provocative tone, the author's main point isn't a direct defense or critique of Confucianism or Yu Ying-Shih. Instead, the essay explores the **pragmatic compromises and adaptations scholars make to maintain relevance and influence within a foreign cultural and political context.**

Here's a breakdown of the core argument:

*   **Survival of Ideas Requires Adaptation:** The author argues that intellectual traditions, even deeply rooted ones like Confucianism, cannot thrive without adapting to the prevailing power structures and cultural norms of a given society. Confucius himself failed because he couldn't adapt his teachings to the needs of rulers.
*   **The Role of Authority and Perception:** The essay highlights how scholars are often elevated to positions of authority not necessarily because of the inherent truth of their ideas, but because they align with the interests of those in power. Yu Ying-Shih's success is attributed to his ability to present Confucianism in a way palatable to a Western academic audience, even if it meant distorting or reinterpreting its core tenets.
*   **The Limits of Cultural Expertise:** The author questions the ability of someone like themselves – a Chinese-American – to definitively judge the success or failure of political systems in other countries (like Britain). This reinforces the idea that understanding and navigating different cultures requires a nuanced and self-aware approach.
*   **A Cynical Observation on Academia:** Ultimately, the essay offers a cynical observation about the academic world, suggesting that it prioritizes conformity and the ability to secure positions over genuine intellectual rigor or adherence to traditional values.

The author isn't necessarily saying that Confucianism *is* or *isn't* compatible with democracy. Instead, they're observing how scholars, including Yu Ying-Shih, strategically position themselves to succeed within a particular system, often at the expense of intellectual honesty or consistency. The essay is a commentary on the pressures and compromises inherent in navigating academia and maintaining influence across cultures. [end of text]
