We need to answer these questions in Chinese. The text is in Cantonese. The text is a rant about a live performance. It is a rant about a concert. The text is full of profanity. The text is: "屌你老母今場首一番の宝物係我人生中最冇撚feel嘅一次，唔撚轉白色全部粉紅色都算，拍手拍片都係意料之內，阿姐同班樂隊特登夾埋撚鳩你班柒頭皮，睇吓你哋有冇反應，結果全部中撚晒招瀨撚晒嘢，後面仲要有個戇撚柒鳩唔係拍手唔係歡呼，而係大叫encore！吓 我屌你老母啊！乜撚嘢encore啊係咪食屎食到傻撚咗！我即刻擰轉身屌鳩佢‘首歌未撚完㗎收嗲啦屌你老母冇撚嘈啦仆街’香港人真係唔撚值得睇live，都係死返去聽熱咖啡算啦屌你老母"

Let's try to parse the text. It is in Cantonese. I'll try to translate it roughly:

"Fuck your mother, this concert is the first time in my life that I've had no feel at all. Even if it's not turning white, all pink is acceptable. Clapping and taking pictures are as expected. The host and the band purposely put you guys in the front row, to see if you have any reaction. The result is that everyone got hit by the water (maybe "招瀨" means "water splashed"?) and got wet. And then there was someone in the back who was not clapping or cheering, but was shouting 'encore!' Fuck, I'm pissed off! What the hell is encore? Is it that you're eating shit until you're crazy? I immediately turned around and told him, 'The first song hasn't finished yet, stop it, fuck you, don't be noisy, get off the stage.' Hong Kong people really are not worth watching live, they should just go back to listening to hot coffee, fuck you."

Wait, let me re-read the text carefully:

"屌你老母今場首一番の宝物係我人生中最冇撚feel嘅一次" - "Fuck your mother, this concert is the first time in my life that I've had no feel at all." Possibly "feel" means "feeling" or " vibe" or "emotion" or "excitement". "唔撚轉白色全部粉紅色都算" - "Even if it's not turning white, all pink is acceptable." I'm not sure what that means. Possibly it's a pun on "feel" vs "feel" in Cantonese? "Feel" might be "feel" as in "feeling", but "feel" might also be "feel" as in "touch"? Not sure.

"拍手拍片都係意料之內" - "Clapping and taking pictures are as expected." "阿姐同班樂隊特登夾埋撚鳩你班柒頭皮" - "The host and the band purposely put you guys in the front row, to see if you have any reaction." "睇吓你哋有冇反應" - "to see if you have any reaction." "結果全部中撚晒招瀨撚晒嘢" - "The result is that everyone got hit by the water (or something) and got wet." "後面仲要有個戇撚柒鳩唔係拍手唔係歡呼，而係大叫encore！" - "And then there was someone in the back who was not clapping or cheering, but was shouting 'encore!'" "吓 我屌你老母啊！乜撚嘢encore啊係咪食屎食到傻撚咗！" - "What the fuck is encore? Is it that you're eating shit until you're crazy?" "我即刻擰轉身屌鳩佢‘首歌未�
