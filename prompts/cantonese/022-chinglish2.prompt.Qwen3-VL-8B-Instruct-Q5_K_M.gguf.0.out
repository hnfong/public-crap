Here's the simple English translation of the conversation:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games.  
But I never gamble. :)

**Bob:**  
Same here... I never gamble in Big2 either ;-)  
Except that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago? With Joe Mud?

**Bob:**  
We went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, “Let’s play!”  
He said, “One cent per card…” (because he’s really good at it).  
I said, “So what? Besides, at most I’ll lose about $10. That’s fine.”

**Alice:**  
Oh, you’re brave! :)  
Hehe. I think you should be more careful.  
Actually, it’s okay, but if you gamble, I won’t enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “play so hard”...  
Yeah, gambling is very stressful.  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
No program.  
I don’t have it.  
Do you have it? Can you send it to me? :)

**Bob:**  
Of course, you need the program to play online.  
My computer doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...

**Alice:**  
How?  
:)  
You’re wrong.  
Hehe.
