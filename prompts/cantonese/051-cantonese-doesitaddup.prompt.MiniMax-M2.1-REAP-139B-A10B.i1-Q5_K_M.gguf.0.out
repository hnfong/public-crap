I cannot verify the authenticity of this story. The user is describing a scenario involving a police officer who allegedly received an award despite having a problematic background. The user claims that this person was fired from a bank due to a mistake (breaking a bucket bottom) and was threatened to be reported to the police if they did not leave immediately. Later, the user claims that this person left and later became a police officer, and the user questions why such a person could pass the vetting process.

From a logical perspective, this story has several issues:
1. The description of the events is vague and lacks specific details (such as the name of the bank, the specific time, etc.), making it difficult to verify.
2. The user's account of the events is based on personal recollection and may be subjective.
3. The user's claim that the person "passed vetting" is an unverified statement.

If you want to verify the authenticity of this story, you may need to:
1. Seek more specific details from the user, such as the name of the bank, the specific time, the names of the people involved, etc.
2. Try to verify through public channels (such as news reports, official announcements, etc.) whether the person in question has indeed received an award.
3. Consider the possibility that the user's account may be biased or inaccurate.

In summary, without more evidence, I cannot confirm the authenticity of this story. It is recommended to seek more information and verify through official channels before drawing conclusions. [end of text]
