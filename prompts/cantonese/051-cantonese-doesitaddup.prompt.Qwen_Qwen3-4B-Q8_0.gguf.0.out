This is a comment from a former colleague of a police officer named Chen Datian, who is being praised for being an outstanding policeman. The comment describes a story about how Chen was dismissed from a British-owned bank after a mistake, and how he was forced to leave by the management, which led him to join the police force. The commenter also mentions that Chen has some personal issues and is unsure why he passed the vetting process to become a police officer.

Let’s break down the story and analyze whether it is credible or not.

---

### 1. **The Story Summary:**
- Chen Datian was a trainee police officer.
- He worked at a British-owned bank for a year.
- He was shadowed by a colleague (the commenter) during his first week.
- He made a mistake (possibly a "slip" or "misstep") that led to him being dismissed.
- The bank manager threatened to report him to the police if he didn’t leave immediately.
- The next day, the commenter returned to work and was confronted by management and security, who arrested Chen and forced him to leave.
- Chen then decided to join the police force.
- The commenter is unsure why Chen passed the vetting process to become a police officer, suggesting that he may have some personal issues.

### 2. **Analysis:**

#### **A. Is this a plausible story?**
- **Possible.** It’s not impossible for someone to be dismissed from a job due to a mistake, especially in a high-pressure environment like a bank.
- The idea of a "slip" (e.g., a mistake in handling money, a customer complaint, or a security breach) is plausible.
- The idea of a manager threatening to report someone to the police is also possible, though it would depend on the specific circumstances and the company’s policies.

#### **B. Is the story credible?**
- **Not necessarily.** The story is told from the perspective of a former colleague, and it’s possible that the narrator is trying to highlight Chen’s character or even to criticize him.
- The mention of "personal issues" and "vetting" suggests that the narrator may not fully trust Chen, or may be trying to explain why he was accepted into the police force despite his past.
- The story is somewhat vague and lacks specific details, which makes it hard to verify.

#### **C. What are the red flags?**
- The story is told in a very casual and possibly biased tone.
- It doesn’t provide clear evidence of what exactly happened.
- The narrator is not a police officer, so they may not have the full context of the vetting process.
- The story could be a way to criticize Chen or to explain his decision to become a police officer.

### 3. **Conclusion:**

This is **not a credible story** in a legal or factual sense. It’s more of a personal account or possibly a biased opinion from a former colleague. While it may contain some elements of truth, it’s not sufficient to conclude that Chen Datian was dismissed from a bank due to a mistake and then joined the police force. The story is likely based on the narrator’s personal experience and may not be entirely accurate.

If you are trying to verify the story, you would need more concrete evidence, such as official records, witness accounts, or documentation from the bank or police department.

### Final Answer:
**No, I don’t buy the story.** It’s a vague, possibly biased account from a former colleague, and lacks the necessary details or evidence to be considered credible. While it may contain some elements of truth, it’s not sufficient to confirm the events described. [end of text]
