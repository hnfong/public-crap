**Overview of the Situation:**

The person is someone who is currently struggling to find a job, despite seeing attractive job advertisements for "pretty girls" and "pretty sisters." He expresses frustration that companies are using cash incentives (現金糧) to attract job applicants, questioning why such incentives are necessary and why he himself is not eligible for them. He admits that he lacks experience and educational qualifications, and wonders on what basis companies would ever hire someone like him. He also notes that the job market is highly competitive, with many people willing to take low-paying, difficult jobs. He mentions that he is already 13 years old and has been working since he was young, but feels that none of these factors help him in securing better opportunities. Ultimately, he concludes that the real reason he cannot get hired is because of his own shortcomings, not because the companies' offers are insufficient or unfair.

**Problems He Has Run Into:**

- **Lack of job opportunities:** He is unable to secure jobs that are being advertised, especially those that seem to target more "attractive" candidates.
- **Lack of qualifications:** He does not have the required experience or educational background.
- **Perceived market competition:** He feels that there are too many people willing to take low-paying jobs, making it even harder for him.
- **Self-doubt and low self-worth:** He feels that his personal circumstances and background are the main barriers to employment.
- **Possible age or social stigma:** He mentions being 13 and already working, which may imply he is young and perhaps not taken seriously by employers, or that he is being treated as "too young" or "too old" for certain jobs.

**Analysis of His Conclusion:**

The person concludes that the reason he cannot get hired is not because the job market or companies are at fault, but because of his own shortcomings. I generally agree with his conclusion, but with some nuance.

On one hand, it is true that in a competitive job market, employers often look for candidates who meet certain minimum requirements—such as education, experience, or even appearance in some cases. If he does not meet these criteria, it is realistic to expect that he will face difficulties in securing those jobs. His self-reflection shows maturity and an understanding of his current limitations.

However, it is also important to consider external factors. Sometimes, job advertisements can be misleading or target a specific image (e.g., "pretty girls") that excludes many qualified candidates regardless of their abilities. Additionally, systemic issues such as age discrimination, lack of entry-level opportunities, or social biases can make it harder for certain people to get jobs, even if they are willing to work hard.

In summary, while his self-assessment is largely accurate—his lack of qualifications and experience are significant barriers—I think he might be underestimating the role that societal and systemic factors can play. It would be helpful for him to focus on improving his skills and qualifications, but he should also be aware that sometimes the system itself can be unfair, and not every barrier is solely due to personal shortcomings.

如果用粵語回應：

**情況概述：**

佢度身處就是一個找唔到工的困境。佢睇到公司招人時用「現金糧」吸引人，但又唔明白點解自己冇機會，因為自己冇經驗、冇學歷，而且可能外形或年齡都唔符合公司要求。佢自己都已經13歲出去工作，但仍然唔好找到合適嘅工作，甚至覺得市場上有好多人願意做低工資、辛苦嘅工，自己更唔容易。

**他面對嘅問題：**

- 唔到合適嘅工作機會
- 冇相關經驗或學歷
- 市場競爭激烈，有人願意做低工資工
- 外形、年齡或其他因素可能被公司忽略
- 自己自信心低落

**對佢結論嘅看法：**

佢自己認為冇人請佢，根本原因係佢自己唔夠好，而唔係公司offer嘅問題。我同意佢嘅結論，因為確實市場上多數時候會優先找有經驗、有學歷、或者符合特定形象嘅人。佢冇這些條件，自然難以找到好工。

但係，我同時也覺得佢可能低估了一些外部因素。有時候公司招人嘅條件或者廣告，可能唔係真正對所有人開放，有時候有隱性偏見，例如年齡、性別、外表等等。另外，社會上有時候對年輕人或者冇學歷嘅人有偏見。所以，雖然佢應該努力提升自己嘅能力和資歷，但同時也要知道，有時候問題唔完全係自己一個人嘅問題，而係整個體制或社會觀念造成的。

總結嘅話，佢自己對自己嘅不足有認知，這很重要，但同時也要識得有時候外部環境同樣影響機會。 [end of text]
