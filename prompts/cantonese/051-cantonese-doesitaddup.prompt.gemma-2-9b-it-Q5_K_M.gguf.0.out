I wouldn't necessarily "buy" the story without further evidence. Here's why:

* **One-sided account:** This is a single person's perspective, potentially biased against Chen. They admit to having a personal connection and frame the events negatively.
* **Lack of specifics:** The details are vague. What exactly did Chen do wrong? What "problems" did he have?  How did he "fail" vetting?  Without specifics, it's hard to assess the validity of the claims.
* **Potential motives:** The commenter might have personal reasons for wanting to discredit Chen, such as resentment or a desire to protect their own reputation.

**What to consider:**

* **Vetting process:** Police vetting is rigorous and involves background checks, interviews, and psychological assessments. It's unlikely someone with serious character flaws would pass.
* **Counter-evidence:**  Are there any other sources or information that contradict this account? Has Chen addressed these allegations?
* **Context:**  What is the overall tone and purpose of the forum? Is it a platform for genuine discussion or potentially for spreading rumors?

**Conclusion:**

While the commenter raises some concerns, it's important to approach this information with skepticism.  Without more evidence and context, it's impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claims.
