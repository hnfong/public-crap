# 詞: 暗諷

2. 佢送咗份好貴嘅禮物俾阿仔，但係成日喺人面前講份禮物唔實用，明顯係暗諷阿仔唔識得欣賞。 (He gave his son a very expensive gift, but constantly said it wasn't practical in front of others, clearly subtly criticizing his son for not appreciating it.)
3. 佢話：「你今次做得好好呀，真係好有進步！」但係個口吻好似講緊反話，擺明係暗諷我仲係得咁上下。 (He said, "You did a great job this time, you've really improved!" But his tone sounded sarcastic, clearly subtly implying I'm still just so-so.)
4. 佢喺Facebook post咗一張自己嘅靚相，caption寫住「平凡嘅生活」，其實暗諷其他人嘅生活唔夠精彩。 (He posted a beautiful picture of himself on Facebook with the caption "Ordinary life," but he was actually subtly implying that other people's lives aren't as exciting.)
5. 佢話：「多謝你嘅意見，我會考慮嘅。」但係個樣就話緊「我唔會聽你講」。呢種回應真係暗諷到極。 (He said, "Thank you for your opinion, I'll consider it." But his expression said, "I'm not listening to you." This response is really subtly dismissive.)

7. 佢話：「你嘅衫好特別啊！」但係個眼神就充滿住嫌棄，明顯係暗諷我嘅衫好醜。 (He said, "Your clothes are very unique!" But his eyes were full of disdain, clearly subtly mocking my clothes as ugly.)
8. 佢成日喺阿媽面前讚其他人嘅仔女叻仔，暗諷我唔夠好。 (He always praises other people's children in front of his mother, subtly implying that I'm not good enough.)

10. 佢話：「恭喜你升職啊！」但係個語氣好似講緊「你都係靠運氣啫」，真係暗諷到明晒。 (He said, "Congratulations on your promotion!" But his tone sounded like "You just got lucky," really subtly implying it wasn't deserved.)
