The story you've shared raises several red flags and inconsistencies that make it difficult to accept at face value, especially given the context of the person receiving an award for being an outstanding policeman. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Character and Vetting**:
   - Police forces, especially in jurisdictions with rigorous standards, have thorough vetting processes. These processes typically include background checks, psychological evaluations, and reference checks. If the person had a significant issue at a previous job, such as being fired for misconduct, it would likely have been uncovered during the vetting process. The fact that the person passed vetting suggests that the story about being fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (presumably a form of misconduct) might be exaggerated or false.

2. **Credibility of the Narrative**:
   - The story is quite dramatic and includes specific details like the boss threatening to report the person to the police and security escorting them out. While these details make the story vivid, they also make it seem more like a fictional account or a significant embellishment. Real-life situations, especially in professional settings, are often less dramatic and more nuanced.

3. **Professional Conduct**:
   - If the person was indeed fired for serious misconduct, it would be highly unusual for them to go on to become an outstanding policeman and receive an award. Police departments value integrity and professionalism, and a history of significant workplace issues would typically disqualify a candidate from such a position.

4. **Motivation for the Story**:
   - Consider the motivation behind the story. Is the person who shared this story biased or has a grudge against the award recipient? Personal conflicts or biases can lead to the spreading of negative or exaggerated stories.

5. **Lack of Corroborating Evidence**:
   - The story is based on a single account and lacks any corroborating evidence. Without additional sources or documentation, it's hard to verify the claims. If the story were true, there would likely be more widespread knowledge or other former colleagues who could confirm the details.

6. **Professional Growth**:
   - People can change and grow. It's possible that the person had a difficult start in their career but made significant improvements and turned their life around. However, the dramatic nature of the story and the claim that the person has "個人品有啲問題" (character issues) without any specific examples of how they overcame these issues make it less credible.

In conclusion, while it's not impossible for the story to be true, the numerous red flags and inconsistencies make it highly unlikely. The rigorous vetting process for police officers, the dramatic nature of the narrative, and the lack of corroborating evidence all suggest that the story should be taken with a grain of salt. It's important to consider multiple perspectives and seek additional information before accepting such claims. [end of text]
