Alright, I need to analyze this comment about a person who recently received an award for being an outstanding policeman. The comment is written in Cantonese, so I'll need to translate and understand it thoroughly before evaluating its credibility.

First, let's break down the content:

1. **Author's Relationship**: The author is a former colleague of the award-winning policeman, Chen Dawen. They worked together at a foreign-owned large bank for one year.

2. **Initial Interaction**: Chen Dawen was new to the company and spent the first week shadowing the author.

3. **Termination Incident**: Due to some issue related to wearing a cabinet bottom (which might be a typo or mistranslation), Chen was let go. The boss threatened to report him to the police if he didn't leave immediately.

4. **Subsequent Actions**: The author returned to the higher-ups and security to escort Chen out of the workplace.

5. **Career Change**: Chen then transferred to become a police officer, and the author mentions that he has personal issues and is unsure why he passed the vetting process.

Now, evaluating the credibility of this story:

- **Plausibility of Events**: The author describes a series of events that seem plausible in a corporate setting, especially in a large bank where strict protocols are followed. Being let go due to a mistake or violation of company policies is common.

- **Transition to Police Force**: It's not uncommon for individuals with certain backgrounds or experiences to transition into law enforcement. However, the mention of personal issues and passing the vetting process raises questions.

- **Author's Perspective**: The author seems to have a critical view of Chen's character, suggesting that his personal issues might have contributed to his termination and subsequent career change. This could indicate a biased perspective, potentially affecting the objectivity of the account.

- **Lack of Specific Details**: The comment lacks specific details that could help verify the events, such as dates, exact reasons for termination, or official documentation of the vetting process. This absence makes it harder to assess the accuracy of the claims.

- **Potential for Bias**: Given that the author is a former colleague with a negative view of Chen, there's a possibility of bias influencing the narrative. It's essential to consider whether the author has any vested interests or personal grievances that might affect the story's reliability.

- **Absence of External Verification**: Without additional sources or evidence supporting the author's claims, it's challenging to determine the story's authenticity. Relying solely on a single account without corroborating information can be risky.

- **Cultural and Contextual Factors**: Understanding the cultural and institutional context of the bank and the police force in the region where this occurred could provide deeper insights. However, without this information, the analysis remains limited.

- **Possible Misinterpretation**: There might be nuances in the language or cultural references that the author assumes the reader understands, which could lead to misinterpretations of the events described.

- **Emotional Tone**: The author's emotional tone suggests frustration or disappointment with Chen's actions and career path, which might cloud the objectivity of the narrative.

- **Potential for Rumors or Speculation**: The story reads like a personal anecdote rather than a formal account. It could be a mix of true events and personal opinions, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction.

- **Lack of Conclusion or Resolution**: The comment ends abruptly without providing a conclusion or resolution to the events described, leaving the reader with unanswered questions about the aftermath and the author's perspective.

In summary, while the events described in the comment are plausible within a corporate and law enforcement context, the lack of specific details, potential for bias, and absence of external verification make it challenging to fully assess the story's credibility. It would be beneficial to seek additional sources or information to corroborate the claims made by the author.

<Output>
I find the story somewhat plausible but lack sufficient details to fully assess its credibility. The author's perspective appears biased, and without additional verification, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the claims made about Chen Dawen's personal issues and career transition.
