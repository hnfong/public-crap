Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

## Alice:
Ha ha.
Yes, me too.
I like to play very much.
But I never gamble.

## Bob:
Hmm... I never gamble on Big Two either.
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
What happened a few weeks ago?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big Two.
I said, "Let's play."
He said, "One cent per card... because he's very good."
I said, "So what?" and besides, I might only lose $10 at most.

## Alice:
Ha ha.
You're so silly.
Hehe. It's good actually. But if you gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

## Bob:
But it's not good to be so serious.
Yes, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
My program.
Here it is.
Do you want to download it or something?

## Bob:
Of course, to play online, you need a program.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... wait...

## Alice:
Okay.
:)
I'll ask him.
Hehe. [end of text]
