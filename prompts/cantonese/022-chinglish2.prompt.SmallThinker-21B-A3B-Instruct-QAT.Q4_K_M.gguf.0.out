Here's a simple English translation of the conversation:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha. Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play a lot.  
But I never gamble. 😄  

**Bob:**  
Oh, right... I never gamble on Big2 either. 😄  
Except for that time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud?  

**Bob:**  
He went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
I said, “Play it!”  
He said, “1 cent for a card… (because he’s really good at it).”  
I said, “I’ll fail so hard…”  
Besides, I only lost about $10. 😄  

**Alice:**  
Gum yau hai. 😄  
Hehe. Lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai.  
It’s actually good. But if you need to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game fully. 😄  

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “stand so hard” (in the game). 😄  
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it’s very stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
Meh program.  
Moe.  
Hai ng hai yiu download or something. 😄  

**Bob:**  
Gum play online (because you need a program to play). 😄  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet… Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP… Wait…  

**Alice:**  
Hoe ark. 😄  
Ng goi sai.  
Hehe.
