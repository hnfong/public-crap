Three hours after getting off work and heading home to surf the internet, I saw people mourning #YuYingshi. At the time, the only thing I knew about him was that he was the idol of the famous blogger #WongWaiHung. Beyond that, I knew nothing of his life.

However, in the 21st century, you don't always need to ask a teacher; with Google, you can learn about the world. After searching for a while, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wong loved to mention Master Yu...

Master Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive is that? Just listing his credentials is enough to scare people!

I acted like a stalker, constantly digging up Yu Yingshi's background: how the Chinese Wikipedia described him, how the English Wikipedia described him, how people praised him when he won awards, and what today's obituaries said about him. A person I deeply respect appeared in my mind... Teacher Yun Gen. They really are quite similar!

Unfortunately, Teacher Yun Gen didn't have a chair at Harvard, but their traditional Chinese kung fu of "knowing the past and present" and "I am China" is definitely of the same origin. Teacher Yun Gen likes Taoism and Buddhism, while Master Yu seems to be a fan of Confucianism.

But that's the problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; it stresses the proper order between the old and the young, and the proper relationship between ruler and subject. However, if you studied at a top American university, earned your PhD during the height of the hippie movement, and returned, do you really think you can go around teaching people to "respect teachers and value the Way" and not indulge in "individualism"? That would be a disaster.

So, how does a scholar avoid such a disaster? This is the knowledge that Confucius spent his entire life struggling to acquire, and Confucian disciples could not possibly be unaware of it. In Confucius's time, the world was on the brink of chaos. He traveled among the various states, hoping to secure an official position and achieve great things. However, he only knew how to recite the rites of the Duke of Zhou and failed to cater to the needs of his employers, ultimately returning empty-handed. But failure is the mother of success, and his students improved greatly. As Sima Qian said: "The seventy disciples scattered among the feudal lords; the great ones became teachers and ministers, while the lesser ones befriended and taught the scholar-officials." Why was this?

Because after several generations of transmission, they began to understand the subtle expressions of the monarchs. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with the rulers had changed; he could joke and laugh, and knew how to flatter his employers: "Your Majesty, I see that you cannot bear to kill even a cow; you must be a benevolent ruler! If you follow the Way of Benevolence, you can succeed!"

By the late Warring States period, the "Confucian" strategists had mastered the game of "monarch interviews." To secure official positions, they abandoned "benevolence" and "propriety" entirely, turning instead to the new technology of "rule by law." Thus, Xunzi, a Confucian disciple, produced students who could become high-ranking officials in the Qin Shi Huang government. In Li Si, you would not detect even a trace of Confucius's spirit.

Today, with over two hundred nations in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than in the Spring and Autumn periods. If Confucian disciples leave China, the land of ancient rituals, and go to the barbaric land of military hegemony, the United States, do you really think they will pull out the *Analects* and tell people to observe three years of mourning? Everyone knows how many times Confucius and his students were turned away. So, when they went to the United States, Confucian disciples naturally claimed that Confucius supported "democracy," that "democracy is great," and that the Communist Party is a disaster. Only then could they become Ivy League professors!

Some might ask: "Doesn't this have consequences?" Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and the Confucian tradition was smashed during the May Fourth Movement. As the top academic authority in the world's only superpower after World War II, you could claim that Johnny Kung taught people to take drugs and play with women, and someone might believe it. After all, American "theoretical nuclear weapons" are solid material; the consequences of the Japanese refusing to believe in邪 (evil) were vividly remembered.

So, why could Master Yu simply translate a few sentences from the *Book of Han* into English and get a PhD, and why were several universities willing to hire him as a professor? #YouKnow. Pushing him onto a pedestal as an authority was to make him firmly say: "Everyone here is a wax duck; you think Confucius's thought is feudal? Oh, what a big misunderstanding! Actually, he was a democrat! If you don't have a Harvard chair, just listen to me!"

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy? Honestly, these "Sinologists" don't know the first thing about it. You say: "The Republic of China is an example." Hey, boss, is Taiwan's political system "Confucian"? The Kuomintang members constantly criticize Tsai Ing-wen; is that how Confucianism works? Does Tsai Ing-wen perform rituals to heaven and earth like a shaman? No. The spirit of science, not being a shaman, goes against the Confucian purpose. Do you think using Chinese characters makes you Confucian? Do you think Confucianism can only exist in China?

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least among advanced nations, they are the most similar to Confucianism): the ruler emphasizes ritual and ceremony, power is granted by heaven, supreme and untouchable, everyone follows a hierarchical order without challenging the ranks, and society remains stable. As for the successes and failures of their democratic systems, that is not something an American-Chinese person is qualified to comment on.

### Comment on the Essay

Disregarding the sarcastic and provocative tone, the main point the author is trying to convey is a critique of the perceived hypocrisy and cultural dissonance in the academic reception of Yu Yingshi (and scholars like him) in the West. The author argues that:

1. **Cultural Adaptation for Academic Success**: The author suggests that Yu Yingshi and similar scholars had to significantly reinterpret or even distort traditional Confucian values to fit the expectations of Western (particularly American) academic institutions. This involved portraying Confucius as a proponent of democracy and individualism, which the author believes contradicts the core tenets of Confucianism.

2. **Conflict Between Confucianism and Western Values**: The essay highlights the inherent tension between Confucian principles (such as hierarchy, respect for authority, and collective order) and Western democratic ideals (such as individualism and equality). The author implies that true Confucianism is incompatible with the democratic systems of the West, and that scholars who claim otherwise are compromising their intellectual integrity for career advancement.

3. **Critique of Western Academic Authority**: The author questions the legitimacy of Western academic institutions as arbiters of Chinese culture and history. He suggests that these institutions may have their own biases and agendas, leading to a distorted understanding of Confucianism and its role in Chinese society.

4. **Historical and Cultural Context**: The essay also touches on the historical evolution of Confucianism, noting how it adapted over time to different political and social contexts. The author implies that the modern interpretation of Confucianism in the West is a product of this adaptation, rather than a faithful representation of the original teachings.

In summary, the author's main point is a critical examination of how traditional Chinese philosophy, particularly Confucianism, has been reinterpreted and sometimes misrepresented in the context of Western academia, raising questions about cultural authenticity and the motivations behind such reinterpretations.
