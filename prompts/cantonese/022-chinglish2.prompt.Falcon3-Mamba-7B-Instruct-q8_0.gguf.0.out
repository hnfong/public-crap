## Alice:
I like playing too.
Yeah, me too.
I like playing a lot, but I never gamble.
:)

## Bob:
Or something... I never gamble at Big2 either...
Except for that time a few weeks ago...

## Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe came over, right?
He wanted to play Big2, so I said, "Let's play."
He said, "One cent per card..." (because he's really good)
I said, "Let's just play for $10."

## Bob:
Gambling isn't good... If I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game very much.
But, actually, I lost a bit that time.

## Alice:
It's okay to lose a bit.
It's good to gamble sometimes, but if you have to gamble, it's not very enjoyable.
Besides, if you lose, you might end up losing something like $10...

## Bob:
But it's not very good to "stand so hard" (stay in the game) ga...
Yeah.
He said, "Let's just play for 1 cent per card..." (since my game is very good)
Mine too.
I laughed.
Haha.
Wait...

## Alice:
Heh.
Let's go.
I need to download the program.
Do you have a program?

## Bob:
You need a program to play Big2 online... My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can download it from my friend or through HTTP... Wait...

## Alice:
Do you have a program?
I don't have the program.
I'll download it.
Okay.
See you.
Heh.
I'll send it to you.
It's okay.
Bye.
