### Alice:
Haha.
Yeah, me too.
I really like to play, but I never gamble.
:)

### Bob:
Oh, I never gamble on Big2 either.
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

### Alice:
A few weeks ago, Joe was involved, right?

### Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
I said, "Sure, let's play."
He said, "1 cent per card" (because he plays very well).
I thought, "It's fine," and figured I'd lose at most $10 or so.

### Alice:
You went for it.
:)
Hehe. It's good actually. But if I had to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

### Bob:
But it's not good to be too stubborn.
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's very stressful.
By the way, do you have the program?

### Alice:
What program?
I don't.
Do I need to download it or something?
:)

### Bob:
To play online, you need a program to play, of course.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP. Wait...

### Alice:
Okay.
:)
No problem.
Hehe. [end of text]
