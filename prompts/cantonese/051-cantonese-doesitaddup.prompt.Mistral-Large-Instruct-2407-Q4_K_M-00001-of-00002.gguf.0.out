 The story provided is written in Cantonese and describes a personal experience with a former colleague who later became an outstanding police officer. Here's a translation and analysis to help determine its credibility:

### Translation:
"I am a former colleague of this outstanding police officer, Chen Dawen, from a bank. We worked together for a year at a certain British bank. Why do I remember him so well? Because during his first week on the job, he shadowed me. He was fired for wearing a barrel bottom (a type of underwear) and was told by the boss that if he didn't leave immediately, the boss would report him to the police. That afternoon, when I returned from lunch, I saw security escorting him out. After that, he went on to take the police exam and became a police officer. His character has some issues, and I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

### Analysis:
1. **Personal Experience**: The story is presented as a firsthand account, which can add credibility. However, personal experiences can be subjective and may not always reflect the full truth.

2. **Specific Details**: The story includes specific details such as the type of underwear and the sequence of events, which can make it seem more believable. However, these details could also be fabricated to make the story more convincing.

3. **Character Assessment**: The author questions the character of the person in question, which could be a biased perspective. It's important to consider that people can change and that one's past actions do not necessarily define their future behavior.

4. **Vetting Process**: The author expresses surprise that the person passed the vetting process to become a police officer. This could be a valid point, as police vetting processes are typically rigorous. However, it's also possible that the person improved their behavior or that the vetting process did not uncover the issues mentioned.

### Conclusion:
While the story is detailed and presented as a personal experience, it's important to approach it with a critical mindset. The author's bias and the subjective nature of personal experiences should be taken into account. Additionally, people can change and improve over time, so past actions may not always reflect their current character. Therefore, while the story is interesting, it should not be taken as definitive proof of the person's character or the validity of their award. [end of text]
