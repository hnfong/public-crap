 The story provided is written in Cantonese and describes a personal experience with a former colleague who recently received an award for being an outstanding policeman. Here's a translation and analysis to help determine its credibility:

### Translation:
"I am a former colleague of this outstanding police officer, Chen Dawen, from a bank. We worked together for a year at a certain British bank. Why do I remember him so well? Because during his first week on the job, he shadowed me. He was fired for wearing a barrel bottom (a type of underwear) and was told by the boss that if he didn't leave immediately, he would be reported to the authorities. That afternoon, when I returned from lunch, I saw security escorting him out. After that, he went on to take the police exam and passed the vetting process. I have some doubts about his character, and I don't know how he managed to pass the vetting process."

### Analysis:
1. **Personal Experience**: The story is based on personal experience, which can make it more believable. However, personal experiences can also be subjective and biased.

2. **Specific Details**: The story includes specific details about the incident, such as the type of underwear and the actions taken by the boss and security. This level of detail can make the story seem more credible.

3. **Character Judgment**: The author expresses doubts about the person's character, which could be a personal opinion rather than an objective fact. This subjectivity can make the story less credible.

4. **Vetting Process**: The author questions how the person passed the vetting process for becoming a police officer. This could be a valid concern, but it's also possible that the vetting process did not uncover the incident or that the person has changed since then.

### Conclusion:
While the story contains specific details that make it seem credible, the subjective nature of the character judgment and the lack of objective evidence make it difficult to fully accept the story at face value. It's possible that the author has a personal bias against the person, which could affect the accuracy of the story. Therefore, it's important to consider the story with a degree of skepticism.
