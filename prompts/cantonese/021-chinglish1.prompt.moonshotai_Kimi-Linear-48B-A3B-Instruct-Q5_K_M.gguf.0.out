We need to translate Chinglish phrases into Cantonese. The examples show that "Chinglish" is basically Cantonese but written down using (often non-standard) pronunciation. English is also code-mixed into it as is the habit of many Hong Kong people.

We need to translate each phrase. The phrases are:

1. gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah
2. ngor ng sik use fai zi gah, use chi gang duck ng duck?
3. mud yeah lei ga?
4. but yuu yat chai yum cha lah
5. gor password send jor hui nei gor yahoo email lu
6. farn hok ho sun fu lor, gei si sin fong ga
7. yau chin lar, daap dik si farn hok...
8. kui doe 9 ng connect 8 ge, man kui yat yeung yeah kui jau darp dai yeung
9. need boot gei, wait me, ng hoe hoi chi ju
10. yap sat yim sat gum gan gap zai

We need to produce the Cantonese translation. The translation should be in standard Cantonese (or at least a natural Cantonese phrase). The examples show that the translation is a Cantonese phrase that would be used in spoken Cantonese. The translation should be in Chinese characters (Cantonese characters). The user wants the translation.

We need to be careful: The phrase "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" is a phrase that might be a mis-phonetic representation of something like "go to the bank to withdraw money ah?" Let's parse.

"gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" - Let's break down:

- gor: "go" (English "go")
- doe: "to" (English "to")
- yau: "have" (English "have"? Actually "yau" is "have" in Cantonese, but here it's used as "to"? Actually "yau" is "to have" or "to have something"? In Cantonese, "yau" can be used as "to have" as in "I have a car" -> "ngor yau che". But here "gor doe yau gor bin tai lo ah" maybe "go to the bank to withdraw money ah?" Let's see.

- gor: "go"
- doe: "to"
- yau: "have"? Actually "yau" is "to have" but also "to have a bank account"? Not sure.
