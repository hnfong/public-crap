The story you’ve shared has several red flags and inconsistencies that make it highly implausible. Here’s why it doesn’t hold up:

### 1. **Unrealistic Workplace Dynamics**
   - The claim that a new employee was "shadowed" (i.e., closely supervised) for a week before being fired for "wearing a bucket" (likely a typo or mistranslation—perhaps "wearing a bucket hat" or "wearing inappropriate clothing") is bizarre. Most companies don’t fire someone for fashion choices, especially in a bank where uniforms or dress codes are usually clearly defined. If the issue was a violation of dress code, the employee would likely be given a warning first.
   - The threat of "reporting to the police" (*報官*) for not leaving immediately is also highly unusual. In most workplaces, termination is handled internally, and threats of legal action are not standard practice unless there’s a serious violation (e.g., theft, harassment, or violence).

### 2. **Police Involvement in Workplace Termination**
   - The idea that security or police would be called to escort someone out of the office for a dress code violation is extreme and highly unlikely. This would only happen in cases of severe misconduct (e.g., physical altercations, threats, or illegal activities). The scenario described sounds more like a workplace farce or a dramatic exaggeration.

### 3. **Transition to Police Work**
   - The claim that the person "rolled over" (*輾轉*) to become a police officer after being fired is also dubious. Police recruitment processes are rigorous, involving background checks (*vetting*), physical fitness tests, psychological evaluations, and interviews. Someone with "personality issues" (*個人品有啲問題*) would almost certainly fail the vetting process unless they had other qualifications or connections. The idea that they "slipped through" is unlikely unless there’s a specific context (e.g., a family member in law enforcement) that isn’t mentioned.

### 4. **Tone and Credibility**
   - The phrasing (*"因為佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow"*) suggests the writer is trying to make the story sound dramatic or humorous, but it comes across as exaggerated or sarcastic. The mention of "wearing a bucket" (*衰穿櫃桶底*) is likely a mistranslation or misinterpretation—perhaps the person was caught in a compromising or embarrassing situation (e.g., sleeping at their desk, wearing inappropriate clothing, or being caught in a fight). The phrase *衰穿櫃桶底* could also be a slang phrase meaning "caught in a mess" or "found in a compromising position."
   - The writer’s tone implies they’re either joking or trying to make a point about the person’s character, but the story lacks concrete details to support the claim that the person was "fired for wearing a bucket" and then became a police officer despite "personality issues."

### 5. **Possible Misinterpretation or Translation Issues**
   - The original comment is in Cantonese, and some phrases may have been mistranslated or misinterpreted. For example:
     - *衰穿櫃桶底* could mean something like "caught in a compromising position" or "found in a messy situation" rather than literally "wearing a bucket."
     - *報官* might not mean "reporting to the police" but could imply a formal complaint or disciplinary action.
   - If the story is meant to be a joke or satire, it’s clear that the writer is exaggerating for comedic effect. If it’s meant to be taken seriously, it’s likely fabricated or based on misunderstandings.

### **Conclusion: Likely Not True**
The story seems to be either:
1. **A joke or exaggerated anecdote** (common in forums where people share humorous or absurd workplace stories).
2. **A mistranslation or misinterpretation** of a real event that was much less dramatic.
3. **A deliberate fabrication** to make the person sound ridiculous or to highlight their "personality issues."

If this is a real story, it’s missing key details that would make it plausible (e.g., what exactly happened in the "bucket" incident, how the person passed vetting, etc.). As it stands, it reads more like a tall tale than a factual account. [end of text]
