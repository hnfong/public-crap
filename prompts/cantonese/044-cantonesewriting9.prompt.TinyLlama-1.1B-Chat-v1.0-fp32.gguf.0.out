你係一個廣東話詞典嘅編輯。你負責編寫詞典內容。而家要編寫嘅詞語係「從頭再嚟」。

以下係一個供你參考嘅詞條：「溜冰場」

```
# 溜冰場
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink
<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

```

按："yue" 係粵語(廣東話)嘅意思，而 "eng" 指英文. 你須編寫詞條嘅解釋 "<explanation>" 同例句 "<eg>"

參考以上格式，請編寫一條新詞目：「從頭再嚟」。(記住，你必須用廣東話語法，唔好用普通話語法。例如，廣東話入面嘅「的」應寫成「嘅」，「是」應寫成「係」。)

# 從頭再嚟
