The story you've shared is **unconvincing** and contains several **inconsistencies and implausibilities** that raise red flags. Here's a breakdown of why the story doesn't hold up:

---

### 1. **Contradiction in the Narrative**
- The person claims to be a **former colleague** of **Chen Dawen**, a **police officer** who was recently awarded for being **outstanding**.
- However, the story describes **Chen Dawen as a former bank employee** who was **fired** for **"falling into the cash register"** (a slang term for embezzlement or theft), and then **left the job** to **take the police exam**.
- This creates a **contradiction**: if Chen Dawen was **fired for misconduct**, how could he be **awarded as an outstanding police officer**? That would be **unethical and impossible** in any official context.

---

### 2. **Unrealistic Scenario**
- The story describes a **highly dramatic and unlikely sequence of events**:
  - A new employee is **shadowed** by a colleague.
  - The employee is **accused of theft**, told to **leave immediately**, or else be reported to the police.
  - The employee is **arrested on the spot** by **security and upper management**.
  - The employee then **leaves the job** to **take the police exam**.
- This is **not how most workplaces operate**, especially in **foreign-owned banks**. Most companies would **not involve security or upper management** in such a situation unless there was **clear evidence of wrongdoing**. Also, **arresting someone on the spot** is **not standard procedure** unless there is a **criminal charge**.

---

### 3. **Inconsistency in the Person's Role**
- The person claims to be a **former colleague** who **shadowed** Chen Dawen.
- However, if Chen Dawen was **fired for misconduct**, it's unlikely that the person would be **close enough** to **shadow** him, especially if the person was **already working in the same department**.
- Also, if the person was **shadowing** him, it suggests a **close working relationship**, which is **unlikely** if the person was **already working in the same bank** and **Chen Dawen was a new employee**.

---

### 4. **Unrealistic Motivation**
- The person claims that Chen Dawen **left the job** to **take the police exam**, implying that he **wanted to become a police officer**.
- However, if he was **fired for misconduct**, it's **highly unlikely** that he would be **allowed to take the police exam**, especially in **Hong Kong**, where **background checks** (vetting) are **very strict**.
- The story says that Chen Dawen **passed the vetting**, which is **impossible** if he had a **criminal record** or was **fired for misconduct**.

---

### 5. **Possible Motive for the Story**
- This could be a **false story** or **rumor** spread to **damage Chen Dawen's reputation**.
- It could also be a **personal attack** or **attempt to discredit** someone who has recently received an **award**.
- In some cases, people may **fabricate stories** to **create controversy** or **gain attention**.

---

### Conclusion:
**I do not buy the story.** It contains **logical inconsistencies**, **unrealistic scenarios**, and **contradictions** that make it **unlikely to be true**. If Chen Dawen was **awarded as an outstanding police officer**, it's **highly improbable** that he had a **criminal record** or was **fired for misconduct**.

If you're trying to verify the truth, you might want to:
- Check official records of the award.
- Look for **other credible sources** or **statements** from Chen Dawen or his colleagues.
- Be cautious of **rumors** or **unverified claims** on forums, especially when they involve **public figures** or **official awards**.
