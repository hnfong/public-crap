Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if I believe the story about this former colleague, Chen Dawen, who became an outstanding policeman. The story is told in Cantonese, so I need to make sure I understand the details correctly.

First, the person claims to have worked with Chen at a British-owned bank for a year. They mention that Chen was new and shadowed them for the first week. Then, he got fired because he "衰穿櫃桶底" which I'm not entirely sure about. Maybe it means he did something wrong with the cash drawer? The boss told him to leave immediately or else report him. The next afternoon, after lunch, the高层 (senior management) and security came to escort him out. Then he went on to become a police officer, and the storyteller is questioning how he passed the vetting process.

So, the question is whether this story is credible. Let me break it down. 

First, the details: working at a British bank, the shadowing period, the reason for dismissal. The dismissal seems abrupt and severe. The term "衰穿櫃桶底" might be a colloquial expression. Maybe it refers to embezzlement or some financial misconduct? If that's the case, then getting fired for that would be serious. But how would someone with such a background pass a police vetting? Police vetting usually checks criminal records, employment history, etc. If he was fired for something like theft or fraud, that might be a red flag. 

But maybe the storyteller is exaggerating or misremembering. Alternatively, maybe the reason for dismissal wasn't as severe as it's made out to be. Or perhaps the vetting process didn't dig into that part of his history. Also, in some cases, vetting might look more at criminal records than employment issues unless they're serious. 

Another angle: the storyteller's credibility. Are they a reliable source? They claim to have worked with him for a year, but only remember him because of the first week's shadowing and the dismissal. Maybe they have a grudge against him. The fact that they're commenting on a forum about his award suggests they might be trying to discredit him. 

Also, the way the dismissal happened—being escorted out by security and management—is quite dramatic. That might be an overstatement. Maybe he resigned or was let go more quietly. 

Possible scenarios: 
1. The story is true, and the vetting process overlooked the issue, perhaps because the bank didn't report it as a criminal matter, or the details weren't disclosed. 
2. The storyteller is mistaken or lying, maybe to tarnish Chen's reputation. 
3. The reason for dismissal was not as serious as presented. 

I should also consider cultural context. In some places, vetting for police might be more lenient, or the specific incident might not be considered a major issue. Alternatively, maybe the bank's internal records don't show the reason, so the vetting didn't find it. 

Another point: the storyteller mentions that Chen "personal character has issues"—so they have a negative opinion. But vetting might have considered his subsequent behavior as a police officer, or maybe the bank didn't provide a reference that included that incident. 

In conclusion, there are reasons to be skeptical. The story has elements that could be exaggerated, and the vetting process usually is thorough. However, without more evidence, it's hard to say for sure. The user might be looking for an analysis of possible angles here.

The story presented raises several points that warrant skepticism, but it is not impossible. Here's a breakdown of the key considerations:

---

### **1. Plausibility of the Incident**
- **"衰穿櫃桶底" (Financial Misconduct?)**:  
  The phrase likely refers to a serious breach of trust, such as embezzlement, theft, or mishandling of funds. If true, this would be a major red flag for any vetting process, especially for a law enforcement role. However, the storyteller’s use of colloquial Cantonese might obscure the exact nature of the misconduct, leaving room for ambiguity.

- **Dramatic Dismissal**:  
  The description of Chen being "escorted out by security and management" is vivid but may be exaggerated. Such a public dismissal is uncommon unless the offense was severe (e.g., theft). If the bank did not involve law enforcement, the incident might not appear in official records, allowing Chen to pass vetting.

---

### **2. Vetting Process for Police Roles**
- **Typical Checks**:  
  Police vetting usually includes criminal records, employment history, and character references. If Chen’s dismissal was for a non-criminal offense (e.g., policy violation, poor performance), it might not automatically disqualify him. However, financial misconduct could be a dealbreaker.

- **Bank’s Reporting Practices**:  
  If the bank did not report the incident to authorities or mark it as a criminal matter, the vetting process might not have uncovered it. Alternatively, the bank might have chosen to handle it internally to avoid reputational damage.

- **Timing**:  
  The storyteller claims Chen was fired and then became a police officer. If enough time passed or the vetting process overlooked the incident, he could have been accepted. Some jurisdictions allow for rehabilitation or second chances.

---

### **3. Credibility of the Storyteller**
- **Motivation**:  
  The storyteller is commenting on a forum about Chen’s award, suggesting potential bias. They may harbor resentment or seek to tarnish his reputation. Their account could be exaggerated or selective (e.g., omitting context that explains Chen’s actions).

- **Reliability of Memory**:  
  The storyteller claims to remember Chen only because of his abrupt dismissal and the first week of shadowing. While plausible, human memory can be faulty, especially for events from years prior.

---

### **4. Possible Scenarios**
- **Scenario 1: The Story is True**  
  - Chen’s misconduct was non-criminal (e.g., violating internal policies) and not reported to authorities.  
  - The vetting process did not thoroughly investigate his banking career, or the bank refused to disclose details.  
  - Chen reformed his behavior, and his police performance overshadowed his past.

- **Scenario 2: Exaggeration or Fabrication**  
  - The storyteller is misremembering or dramatizing events (e.g., conflating minor mistakes with serious misconduct).  
  - Chen was fired for a less severe reason (e.g., poor performance), which the storyteller is inflating to discredit him.  
  - The dismissal never happened, and the story is a personal vendetta.

- **Scenario 3: Systemic Oversight**  
  - The vetting process had flaws, failing to uncover Chen’s past due to incomplete records or procedural gaps.  
  - Chen provided misleading information, and the bank did not contest it.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
While the story contains elements that raise doubts (e.g., dramatic dismissal, unclear nature of misconduct), it is not entirely implausible. Key questions remain unresolved:
- Was the misconduct criminal or merely an internal policy violation?  
- Did the bank report the incident or keep it confidential?  
- How thorough was the police vetting process?

Without additional evidence (e.g., records from the bank or vetting reports), the story cannot be fully verified. However, the storyteller’s forum comment suggests a personal agenda, which should be considered. In summary, **the story is questionable but not impossible**—it hinges on details that are not fully disclosed. [end of text]
