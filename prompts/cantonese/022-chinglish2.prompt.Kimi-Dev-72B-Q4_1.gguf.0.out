Alice and Bob are discussing their experiences with playing Big2, a card game. Alice mentions that she likes to play but never gambles. Bob also says he doesn't gamble on Big2 except for a specific instance a few weeks ago. They recall a time when they played at a friend's house with a small bet of 1 cent per card. Alice reflects that gambling can stress the game enjoyment. The conversation then shifts to obtaining a program for playing Big2 online, with Bob asking if Alice has it and how to transfer it, but they realize the client doesn't support file transfers yet. The exchange ends with some light-hearted banter.
