The person is a young professional who has been struggling to find a job due to the lack of suitable candidates. He has also realized that the company is using cash incentives to attract job seekers, which he finds unfair and discriminatory. He believes that if he cannot get a job due to his lack of experience and qualifications, it is because the market is oversaturated with people and the companies are not providing enough attractive offers. He has also come to the conclusion that if he cannot get a job, it is because the companies have a problem.

I agree with his overall situation and the problems he has faced. I also believe that companies should not use cash incentives as a means of recruitment. Instead, they should focus on providing a good work environment, training and opportunities for growth. 

However, I do not agree with his conclusion that the problem lies with the companies. I believe that the problem lies with the job seekers themselves. They should not be discouraged by the lack of suitable candidates and should instead focus on improving their qualifications and experience. 

In conclusion, while I understand his frustration, I believe that the problem is not solely the lack of suitable candidates or the unfair use of cash incentives. The root of the problem lies with the job seekers themselves.
