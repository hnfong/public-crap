The story presented raises several red flags and seems unlikely for a few reasons:

1. **Suspicious Circumstances of Termination**: The story mentions that the individual was fired for wearing inappropriate footwear (cabinet drawers, which is likely a mistranslation of "cabinet drawers" for "slippers" or "sandals"). This seems like an unusual reason for termination, especially in a bank setting where dress code is typically strict but not usually so specific as to include such a minor infraction.

2. **Threat of Reporting to Police**: The story states that the employer threatened to report the employee to the police if they did not leave immediately. This is an unusual and extreme reaction to a minor dress code violation, and it's not typical for employers to threaten to involve law enforcement over such a matter.

3. **Immediate Police Involvement**: The story mentions that security personnel and management came to escort the employee out of the building immediately after lunch. This level of immediate and forceful action seems excessive for a minor infraction and is not a common practice in most professional settings.

4. **Questionable Transition to Police Force**: The story claims that the individual was subsequently arrested and then went on to join the police force. It's highly unusual for someone to be arrested and then transition to a career in law enforcement, especially given the vetting process involved in becoming a police officer.

5. **Vetting Process**: The story mentions that the individual passed the vetting process despite having a questionable background. The vetting process for police officers is typically rigorous and would likely have uncovered any significant issues in a candidate's background.

Given these inconsistencies and the unusual nature of the events described, it is unlikely that this story is entirely accurate. The vetting process for police officers is designed to ensure that candidates meet high standards of integrity and professionalism, and it's improbable that someone with a background involving such extreme circumstances would pass this process.

In conclusion, the story seems highly improbable and likely contains significant exaggerations or inaccuracies. It's important to approach such claims with skepticism, especially when they involve sensitive topics like law enforcement and professional conduct. 

If you have any doubts about the authenticity of such claims, it's best to seek out verified information from official sources or to consult with individuals who have direct knowledge of the events in question.
