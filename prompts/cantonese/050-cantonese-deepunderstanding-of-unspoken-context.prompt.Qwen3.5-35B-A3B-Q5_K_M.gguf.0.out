Here is a critique of the paragraph, broken down into the objective situation analysis and an evaluation of the conclusion.

### 1. Objective Situation Analysis

**Who is the person?**
The author appears to be an older male (likely in his 40s or 50s, given the reference to being 13 years old when he started working, which places his start date in the 1970s or 1980s). He identifies as a "traditional" worker who values hard work, low barriers to entry, and immediate cash flow. He likely has a background in manual labor or low-skilled service industries where experience was gained on the job rather than through formal education.

**What is his overall situation?**
He is observing the current Hong Kong (implied by the Cantonese dialect and context) job market. He perceives a disconnect between the expectations of young job seekers ("靚仔靚妹" - handsome boys and pretty girls) and the reality of available employment. He notes that many young people are complaining about unemployment despite the existence of jobs.

**What problems has he run into (or observed)?**
The core problem he identifies is a **mismatch of expectations and qualifications**:
*   **The Job Seekers' Side:** They demand "cash wages" (implying immediate, high liquidity) but lack the necessary prerequisites (experience, academic qualifications) to secure them. They also express reluctance to accept jobs that are "hard, dirty, have no future, and low pay."
*   **The Employers' Side:** Companies are offering cash wages specifically to attract workers, likely because the pool of willing candidates is shrinking. However, the author argues that companies are not the ones at fault; the fault lies with the candidates' inability to meet the basic requirements of the market.

**Why is this happening (according to the author)?**
The author believes the root cause is a lack of **work ethic and realistic self-assessment** among the younger generation. He argues that because the market is saturated with people who refuse to do "dirty" or "low-status" work without the necessary skills, companies cannot find anyone. He contrasts this with his own generation, which started working at 13 and accepted any job regardless of conditions.

### 2. Evaluation of the Conclusion

**The Conclusion:**
The author concludes that the current "labor shortage" (companies can't find people) is not due to a lack of job offers, but rather because the job seekers themselves have "problems" (lack of skills, poor attitude, high expectations).

**Do I agree?**
**Partially, but with significant caveats.** The author's perspective contains a grain of truth but lacks a holistic understanding of the modern economic landscape.

**Points of Agreement:**
*   **Skill Mismatch:** It is undeniable that there is a gap between the skills young people possess and the skills employers need. If a candidate has no experience or education, they cannot command high wages or avoid "dirty" work.
*   **Work Ethic:** A strong work ethic and willingness to start from the bottom are still valuable traits. The author's personal experience of starting at 13 highlights the resilience required in the past.

**Points of Disagreement / Nuance:**
*   **Economic Context:** The author attributes the situation solely to individual character flaws ("your own conditions don't match"). He ignores macroeconomic factors such as:
    *   **Inflation and Cost of Living:** Wages that were "low" in the 1980s are now insufficient to survive in modern Hong Kong. What was acceptable then is poverty-level now.
    *   **Structural Changes:** The economy has shifted from manufacturing to services and tech. "Cash wages" for manual labor are often low because the industry itself is shrinking or being automated.
    *   **Education Inflation:** In the past, a middle school education was enough for a decent job. Today, even entry-level jobs often require degrees, making the "no experience, no degree" path much harder than it was for the author.
*   **Generalization:** Labeling all young job seekers as "complaining" (呻) ignores the reality that many are overqualified for the available low-skilled jobs or are struggling to find *any* work due to a tight labor market caused by demographic shifts (aging population), not just attitude.
*   **The "Cash Wage" Paradox:** The author asks why companies use cash wages to attract people. In reality, this often indicates a desperate need for labor in sectors that are unattractive to the younger generation (e.g., construction, cleaning, food service) due to poor working conditions, not just because the workers are "greedy."

**Final Verdict:**
The author is **partially correct** that individual responsibility matters; no one can demand high pay without providing value. However, his conclusion is **too simplistic and dismissive**. He fails to acknowledge that the "rules of the game" have changed. The problem is not just that young people have "problems," but that the **structure of the job market** has evolved in a way that makes the "start at 13, do anything" model less viable or less rewarding than it was in the author's youth. Blaming the workers entirely ignores the systemic issues of wage stagnation, rising costs, and the devaluation of low-skilled labor. [end of text]
