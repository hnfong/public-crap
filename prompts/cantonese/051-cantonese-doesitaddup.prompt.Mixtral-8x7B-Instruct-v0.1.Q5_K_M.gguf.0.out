 Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine the validity of the story without additional context or evidence. However, there are some potential red flags that may indicate the story could be exaggerated or fabricated.

Firstly, the use of vague and subjective language, such as "some interval" and "a certain bank," can make it difficult to verify the events described. Additionally, the fact that the author's coworker was able to successfully join the police force despite supposedly having personal issues that raised red flags during the vetting process may seem unlikely or implausible.

Furthermore, the author's description of their coworker as "wearing a suitcase bottom" and being "hotter than others" is unclear and could be interpreted in different ways. It is possible that the author is using idiomatic expressions or slang that may not be easily understood by non-native speakers. However, the language used could also be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate in a formal context.

Overall, while it is possible that the story is true, the use of vague language and potentially exaggerated or unprofessional descriptions may raise doubts about its validity. [end of text]
