Sure! Here's a simple English translation of the conversation between Alice and Bob:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha. Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play [Big Two], but I never gamble, you know. :)  

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don’t gamble when playing Big Two either, except for that time a few weeks ago.  

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, was it with Joe?  

**Bob:**  
I went to a friend’s house. He wanted to play Big Two, so I said okay.  
He said we could play for 1 cent per card... (because he’s really good at it).  
I said okay, but I was being too careful. Besides that, I’d lose at most like $10 or so...  

**Alice:**  
Yeah, that’s true. :)  
It’s actually pretty good. But if I were to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.  

**Bob:**  
But it’s not very good to be too cautious...  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the program?  

**Alice:**  
I have the program.  
But...  
You have to download it or something. :)  

**Bob:**  
If we play online, of course we need a program to play, right?  
My client doesn’t support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...  

**Alice:**  
Okay then. :)  
I’ll try.  

**Bob:**  
Haha.

Let me know if you want a more formal or casual version! [end of text]
