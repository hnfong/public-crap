The person is also concerned about the low wages offered by the job market and the lack of prospects for their future career.

2. Discussion of the problem:
The person's problem is that they are not able to find a job that matches their qualifications and experience, and they are struggling to find a job that offers a decent salary and prospects for their future career. The person is also concerned about the low wages offered by the job market and the lack of prospects for their future career.

3. Conclusion:
The person concludes that the problem is not with the job market, but with themselves. They believe that their own qualifications and experience are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the job market, and that they need to improve their skills and qualifications in order to find a job that matches their abilities.

4. Agreement with the conclusion:
I agree with the person's conclusion that their own qualifications and experience are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the job market. However, I also believe that the job market is not perfect and that there are many factors that can affect a person's ability to find a job, such as the economy, the industry, and the company's policies. Therefore, it is important for the person to continue to improve their skills and qualifications, but they should also be aware of the limitations of the job market and be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances.
