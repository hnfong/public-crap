<Thought>
Alright, I need to create a new entry for the Cantonese dictionary word "懵然不知". First, I'll identify the parts of speech. "懵然不知" seems to be a phrase that conveys a state of being unaware or ignorant. It likely translates to something like "completely unaware" or "unconsciously ignorant".

Next, I'll think about how to structure the explanation in Cantonese. I'll need to define the phrase and provide its equivalent in English. Additionally, I should include example sentences to illustrate its usage in context.

I'll start by breaking down the phrase:
- "懵然" (mong4 yan4): This part means "dazed" or "bewildered".
- "不知" (bi5 nei5): This translates to "do not know".

Combining these, "懵然不知" means "completely unaware" or "unconsciously ignorant".

For the example sentence, I'll need to construct a sentence in Cantonese that demonstrates the usage of "懵然不知". I'll ensure that the sentence follows Cantonese grammar rules, using appropriate particles and structure.

Finally, I'll translate the example sentence into English to maintain consistency with the provided format.
