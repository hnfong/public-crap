Hmm, the user wants me to translate a Cantonese-English mixed conversation into simple English. This looks like a casual chat between Alice and Bob with lots of Cantonese slang and internet shorthand.

First I need to identify all the Cantonese expressions: "lor", "gum", "moe", "ng", "hai", "yau hai", "juun", "ngoi", "ark" etc. These are common in Hong Kong English chats. The content is about playing cards (Big2 game) with small stakes gambling mentioned.

The tone is very friendly and playful with emoticons :) and hehe. Alice seems cautious about gambling while Bob is more relaxed. Their dynamic feels like close friends sharing anecdotes.

For translation approach: I'll replace Cantonese phrases with natural English equivalents while keeping the casual tone. "Lor" becomes casual sentence endings like "though", "gum" becomes "then", "moe" is "don't have". Need to preserve the humor in Bob's gambling story and Alice's "fai si so hing" reaction.

Special attention to cultural terms: "Big2" is a card game, "1 cent for a card" means per point scoring. "Stand so hard" is literal translation of being rigid about rules. The program/client part refers to gaming software.

I notice Alice uses more Cantonese (ng hai, juun hai) showing stronger local flavor, while Bob mixes more English. Their FTP/HTTP exchange suggests tech-savvy users. The "ng goi sai" at end is classic Cantonese thanks.

Keeping it simple but not oversimplifying - maintaining the playful vibe is crucial. The dollar amounts ($10) and gambling tension give nice cultural texture about Hong Kong's mahjong/gaming culture.

Here's the simplified English translation of the conversation:

**Alice:**  
Ha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like playing games, haha.  
But I never gamble, though.  
:)

**Bob:**  
Oh... I don't gamble in Big2 either ;-)  
Except that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago? What happened?  

**Bob:**  
Went to a friend's house.  
He wanted to play Big2.  
So I said okay.  
Then he said 1 cent per card... (because he's really good).  
So I thought, "Why not?"... Besides, at most I’d lose like $10...  

**Alice:**  
Oh, I see.  
:)  
Hehe. You’re pretty easygoing.  
It’s fine actually. But if I *had* to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game fully.  

**Bob:**  
But being too strict isn’t great either...  
Yeah, gambling makes it stressful...  
By the way, do you have the game program?  

**Alice:**  
What program?  
Nope.  
Do I need to download it or something?  
:)  

**Bob:**  
Well, to play online you definitely need the program...  
My chat client can’t send files yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP.... Wait...  

**Alice:**  
Okay.  
:)  
Thanks a lot!  
Hehe

### Key simplifications:
- Replaced Cantonese slang (lor, gum, wor, jeh, yau hai, etc.) with natural English equivalents.
- Simplified phrases like "fai si 'so hing' la" → "thought, 'Why not?'"
- Clarified ambiguous terms ("moe" → "nope", "ng goi sai" → "Thanks a lot").
- Kept the casual tone with "ha", "hehe", and emoticons intact.
- Explained context (e.g., "1 cent for a card" implies betting per point in the game). [end of text]
