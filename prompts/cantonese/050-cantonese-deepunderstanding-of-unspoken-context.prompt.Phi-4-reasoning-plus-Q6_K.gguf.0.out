We are asked: "Critique this paragraph. Give an overview of the (objective) situation the person is in, i.e. who is he, what is his overall situation and what problem(s) he has run into, and why. Finally, discuss whether you agree with his conclusion. You may answer in either English or Cantonese." The paragraph is in Cantonese. Let's read the paragraph carefully:

"見到而家啲靚仔靚妹話搵唔到工 其實真係根呻下⋯.又要搵現金糧 知唔知點解公司要用現金糧去吸引啲求職者先？你自身條件都唔配合現金糧你點做呀？自己冇經驗 冇學歷 憑咩人哋請你？即係講真個市場咁多人 真係請咗你又話辛苦污糟冇前景人工低令阿叔我13歲已經出嚟做嘢完全都唔介意以上嘅問題 自身條件唔好就根本上啲人上冇選擇 我終於明白到點解而家話請唔到人 唔係公司舖頭offer唔夠係根本上啲人有問題"

Let's try to translate and understand the paragraph:

"Seeing nowadays many handsome and pretty people complaining that they can't find a job. Actually, it's really a complaint about the root cause... Also, they need to find a cash salary. Do you know why companies use cash salary to attract job seekers? If your own conditions don't match the cash salary, what do you do? If you yourself have no experience, no qualifications, on what basis would others hire you? That is, in the market there are so many people, and if they hire you, they'll say it's hard work, dirty, no prospects, low pay, and even my uncle at 13 years old has already started working, and he doesn't mind the above issues. If your own conditions are not good, then basically you have no choice. I finally understand why nowadays people say they can't be hired. It's not that companies don't have enough offers; it's that the people themselves have problems."

Let's re-read the paragraph carefully:

"見到而家啲靚仔靚妹話搵唔到工" means "Seeing nowadays many handsome and pretty people complaining that they can't find a job." Then "其實真係根呻下⋯" means "Actually, it's really a complaint about the root cause..." Possibly "根" means "root" or "fundamental" problem. Then "又要搵現金糧" means "Also, they need to find a cash salary." "知唔知點解公司要用現金糧去吸引啲求職者先？" means "Do you know why companies use cash salary to attract job seekers?" "你自身條件都唔配合現金糧你點做呀？" means "If your own conditions don't match the cash salary, what do you do?" "自己冇經驗 冇學歷 憑咩人哋請你？" means "If you yourself have no experience, no qualifications, on what basis would others hire you?" "即係講真個市場咁多人" means "That is, in the market there are so many people" "真係請咗你又話辛苦污糟冇前景人工低" means "if they hire you, they'll say it's hard work, dirty, no prospects, low pay" "令阿叔我13歲已經出嚟做嘢完全都唔介意以上嘅問題" means "even my uncle at 13 years old has already started working, and he doesn't mind the above issues." "自身條件唔好就根本上啲人上冇選擇" means "If your own conditions are not good, then basically you have no choice." "我終於明白到點解而家話請唔到人" means "I finally understand why nowadays people say they can't be hired." "唔係公司舖頭offer唔夠俗根本上啲人有問題" means "It's not that companies don't have enough offers; it's that the people themselves have problems."

So the paragraph is a rant about job seekers complaining about not being able to find a job, and the author is saying that the real problem is not that companies don't offer enough jobs, but that the job seekers themselves are not qualified or experienced enough. The author is also criticizing the idea of cash salary as a lure for job seekers, and saying that if you don't have the necessary qualifications or experience, you have no choice but to accept low-quality jobs. The author also mentions that even a 13-year-old (uncle) is willing to work, implying that the job market is competitive and that people with poor qualifications have no choice but to accept whatever is available.

Now, the question: "Critique this paragraph. Give an overview of the (objective) situation the person is in, i.e. who is he, what is his overall situation and what problem(s) he has run into, and why. Finally, discuss whether you agree with his conclusion." So we need to provide an overview of the objective situation: Who is he? The person is a job seeker, complaining about the job market. He is likely someone who is aware of the job market conditions, and he is complaining about the fact that many people are complaining about not being able to find a job, but he thinks that the real problem is that they are not qualified enough. He is also complaining about the use of cash salary as a lure by companies, and he is saying that if you don't have the necessary qualifications, you have no choice but to accept low-quality jobs. He is also saying that the market is competitive, and that even a 13-year-old is willing to work, so if you're not qualified, you have no choice.

Now, what is his overall situation? The person is likely a job seeker who is frustrated with the job market. He is complaining about the fact that many people are complaining about not being able to find a job, but he thinks that the real problem is that they are not qualified enough. He is also complaining about the fact that companies use cash salary as a lure, and that if you don't have the necessary qualifications, you have no choice but to accept low-quality jobs. He is also saying that the market is competitive, and that even a 13-year-old is willing to work, so if you're not qualified, you have no choice.

What problems has he run into? He is facing the problem of not being able to find a job because he doesn't have the necessary qualifications or experience. He is also facing the problem of companies using cash salary as a lure, which he thinks is not
