Based on the comment, it is difficult to fully verify the credibility of the story, but there are several reasons to approach it with skepticism:

1. **Lack of Evidence**: The commenter provides no concrete evidence (e.g., documents, dates, or names) to support their claims about the alleged misconduct or the events that followed. Without verifiable details, it’s hard to assess the truthfulness of the story.

2. **Possible Motives**: The commenter’s tone seems negative and possibly resentful (e.g., calling the individual’s "personal character" into question). This raises the question of whether the story is motivated by personal bias or a desire to tarnish the person’s reputation.

3. **Unverified Claims**: The claim that the individual was fired for "stealing from the bank" (衰穿櫃桶底) and then somehow passed police vetting is questionable. Police background checks are typically thorough, and such a serious allegation would likely be flagged unless there was evidence to the contrary.

4. **Anecdotal Nature**: The story is entirely anecdotal, relying on the commenter’s personal recollection. Memory can be unreliable, and details may be exaggerated or misremembered over time.

5. **Contradiction with Award**: If the individual has indeed been recognized as an "outstanding policeman," it suggests that their professional conduct has been validated by the police force. This contradicts the commenter’s assertion that they have "personal character issues."

### Conclusion:
While the story *could* be true, there is no concrete evidence to support it, and the commenter’s negative tone makes the account less credible. Without independent verification, it’s best to treat the story with caution and not assume it reflects the truth. If the allegations were serious enough, they likely would have been investigated during the police vetting process. 

Would I "buy" the story? Not without further proof. It’s more plausible that this is a disgruntled ex-colleague’s attempt to discredit someone who has since moved on to a successful career. [end of text]
