No, I do not buy this story. It contains several logical inconsistencies, factual errors regarding banking procedures, and internal contradictions that suggest it is likely a fabrication, a joke, or a malicious rumor rather than a factual account.

Here is a breakdown of why the story is highly suspicious:

### 1. The Terminology Contradiction ("Student Officer" vs. "Fired")
*   **The Claim:** The commenter calls the person an "優秀**學警**" (Outstanding **Student Officer**).
*   **The Contradiction:** In the Hong Kong Police Force, a "Student Officer" (學警) is a recruit currently undergoing training at the Police Training College. They are not yet fully sworn-in officers and certainly cannot receive an award for being an "Outstanding Policeman" (which implies a fully qualified, serving officer).
*   **The Logic Gap:** If he was fired from a bank and *then* joined the police, he would be a "Student Officer" only during his training. If he has already received an award for being an "Outstanding Policeman," he is a fully qualified officer. The commenter is mixing the terminology, likely to make the story sound more dramatic or to confuse the timeline.

### 2. The Banking Procedure is Unrealistic
*   **The Claim:** The person was fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (a Cantonese idiom meaning making a massive, catastrophic mistake, often involving money or security) and the boss threatened to call the police immediately.
*   **The Reality:** In a major British-owned bank (as claimed), firing an employee for a mistake is a serious HR and legal process.
    *   **Immediate Police Involvement:** Banks do not typically call the police to "escort" an employee out of the building immediately after a mistake unless there is clear evidence of **fraud or theft**. If it was just a "mistake" (even a big one), the bank would handle it internally, suspend the employee, and conduct an audit.
    *   **Security Escort:** Having security physically "押住佢執野走" (escort him while he packs his things) is an extreme measure usually reserved for violent threats or confirmed criminal activity. Doing this for a "mistake" would expose the bank to massive legal liability for false imprisonment or assault.
    *   **The "Shadowing" Timeline:** The story says he shadowed the narrator for a week, made a mistake, and was fired the same day. In banking, new hires (especially those shadowing) are rarely given access to sensitive areas or funds that could cause a "catastrophic" error in their first week.

### 3. The "Vetting" Argument is Flawed
*   **The Claim:** The commenter asks, "How did he pass the vetting?" implying that a person with a history of being fired for a major mistake would be rejected.
*   **The Reality:**
    *   **Context Matters:** Police vetting (background checks) looks for criminal records, financial insolvency, and character references. Being fired from a job for a mistake (unless it involved criminal fraud) does not automatically disqualify someone.
    *   **The "Mistake" vs. "Crime":** If the person was actually fired for a crime (like theft), the police would know immediately during the vetting process because the bank would have reported it. If the bank *didn't* report it to the police (which is implied if the police didn't arrest him on the spot), then there is no criminal record to fail the vetting.
    *   **The Contradiction:** If the bank was so angry they called the police, the police would have a record of the incident. If the police have a record of the incident, he wouldn't have passed vetting. If he passed vetting, the incident likely wasn't a criminal offense, meaning the bank's reaction (calling the police to escort him out) was disproportionate and unlikely.

### 4. Tone and Motivation
*   **The Tone:** The language is highly emotional and gossipy ("衰穿櫃桶底", "報官", "押住佢"). It reads like a classic internet rumor designed to discredit a public figure.
*   **The "Anonymous" Nature:** The commenter claims to be a "former colleague" but provides no verifiable details (names of the bank, specific dates, or the nature of the mistake).
*   **The Goal:** The story is structured to create a "hero vs. villain" narrative. It tries to undermine the award by suggesting the person is a fraud who "slipped through the cracks."

### Conclusion
The story is **not credible**. It relies on a misunderstanding of police ranks (Student Officer vs. Officer), describes banking security procedures that would be illegal or highly irregular, and presents a logical paradox regarding the police vetting process.

It is most likely a piece of **fake news or a malicious rumor** intended to smear the reputation of the award winner. In the absence of concrete evidence (like a police report or a court case), this anecdote should be treated as fiction. [end of text]
