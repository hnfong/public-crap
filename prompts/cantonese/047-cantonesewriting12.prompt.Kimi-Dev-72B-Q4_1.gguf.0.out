◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a dictionary entry for the term "止蝕" in Cantonese. The example given is for "溜冰場", so I need to follow that structure.

First, I need to understand what "止蝕" means. From my knowledge, "止蝕" in Cantonese refers to cutting losses in trading or investments. So the English equivalent would be "cut losses" or "stop loss".

Now, let's structure the entry. The format includes the term, part of speech (pos), explanation in both Cantonese and English, and an example sentence with both languages.

The part of speech for "止蝕" is probably a verb or a noun. In financial contexts, it's often used as a verb, like "to cut losses". But sometimes it can be a noun as in "stop loss order". However, in Cantonese, the term might be more of a verb phrase. Let me check.

In the example, "溜冰場" is a noun. So for "止蝕", maybe it's a verb. Let's check the structure. The term "止蝕" is composed of "止" (stop) and "蝕" (loss), so it's a verb meaning to stop losses. So the part of speech would be a verb.

Wait, but in some contexts, "止蝕" could be a noun as in "stop loss mechanism". But perhaps in Cantonese, it's more commonly used as a verb. Let me think of a sentence. For example, "我止蝕咗" would mean "I cut my losses". So the verb form.

So the part of speech (pos) would be "動詞" (verb). But the example uses "名詞" (noun) for "溜冰場". So in the entry, the pos should be correctly identified.

Next, the explanation. In Cantonese, the explanation would be something like "喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失" (When investing or trading, when losses reach a certain level, stop to prevent greater losses). But need to write it concisely.

The English explanation would be "cut losses" or "stop loss".

Then, the example sentence. Let's create a simple sentence. For example, "佢今日止蝕咗" (He cut his losses today). Or "我止蝕咗一筆交易" (I cut losses on a trade).

So putting it all together:

The entry would start with "# 止蝕" followed by "(pos:動詞)".

Then the explanation in Cantonese and English.

The example would have both Cantonese and English versions.

Wait, but the example given for "溜冰場" uses "yue" and "eng" sections. So for "止蝕", the explanation would have a "yue" part and an "eng" part. Similarly, the example sentence would have both.

So the structure would be:

# 止蝕
(pos:動詞)
<explanation>
yue:喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失
eng:cut losses or stop loss
<eg>
yue:佢今日止蝕咗。 (keoi4 jat1 jat6 zi2 sap3 zo2.)
eng:He cut his losses today.

But wait, the example sentence needs to be in both Cantonese and English, with the romanization. Let me check the example given. For "溜冰場", the example is:

yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

So the Cantonese part has the sentence and the Jyutping romanization in parentheses. Then the English translation.

So for "止蝕", the example sentence would be something like:

yue:我今日止蝕咗。 (ng5 jat1 jat6 zi2 sap3 zo2.)
eng:I cut my losses today.

But need to make sure the Cantonese sentence is grammatically correct. "止蝕咗" is the past tense. "我今日止蝕咗" would be "I cut losses today". Alternatively, "佢止蝕咗" (he cut losses).

Another possible example: "呢間公司有止蝕機制" (This company has a stop loss mechanism). But that's more of a noun usage. However, if "止蝕" is a verb, then the first example is better.

So putting it all together:

# 止蝕
(pos:動詞)
<explanation>
yue:喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失
eng:cut losses or stop loss
<eg>
yue:我今日止蝕咗。 (ng5 jat1 jat6 zi2 sap3 zo2.)
eng:I cut my losses today.

But wait, the part of speech. In Cantonese, "止蝕" can be a verb, but maybe it's a noun as in "stop loss order". Hmm. Let me check. If you say "止蝕位" (stop loss position), then "止蝕" is a noun. But when used as "止蝕咗", it's a verb. So perhaps the part of speech can be both noun and verb. But the example given for "溜冰場" is a noun. So maybe in the dictionary entry, we should list both possibilities. However, the user's example only shows one part of speech. So perhaps we need to choose the most common usage. In the context of trading, "止蝕" is often used as a verb. So the pos would be "動詞".

Alternatively, maybe it's a noun. For example, "設定止蝕" (set stop loss). So "止蝕" is a noun there. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let me think. In English, "cut losses" is a verb phrase, while "stop loss" can be a noun. So in Cantonese, "止蝕" could be either. But the user's example for "溜冰場" is a noun. So perhaps for "止蝕", if it's more commonly used as a verb, then the pos is "動詞". But if it's a noun, then "名詞".

Alternatively, maybe the term is a verb. Let's check the structure. "止" is a verb (to stop), and "蝕" is a noun (loss). So "止蝕" would be a verb meaning to stop losses. So the pos is "動詞".

Therefore, the entry would be:

# 止蝕
(pos:動詞)
<explanation>
yue:喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失
eng:cut losses or stop loss
<eg>
yue:我今日止蝕咗。 (ng5 jat1 jat6 zi2 sap3 zo2.)
eng:I cut my losses today.

But wait, the Cantonese explanation should be written in Cantonese grammar. For example, "喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失" is more like Mandarin. In Cantonese, it might be "投資或者做交易時，當輸到一定程度就停手，避免輸更多". But I need to make sure the explanation is in proper Cantonese.

Alternatively, the explanation could be "止住損失，唔好輸太多" (stop the losses, don't lose too much). But need to make it concise.

So perhaps the Cantonese explanation is "當投資輸到一定程度時停止，以減少損失" (When investments lose to a certain extent, stop to reduce losses). But again, the grammar should be Cantonese.

Alternatively, "止住損失嘅行為" (the act of stopping losses). But maybe that's too noun-like. If the pos is a verb, the explanation should describe the action.

Hmm. Maybe the best way is to describe it as a verb. So "喺投資或者交易時，當出現虧損時停止，以避免更大損失" (When investing or trading, stop when there's a loss to prevent bigger losses). But in Cantonese, the sentence structure might be different.

Alternatively, "止住損失" (stop the losses). But that's more of a noun phrase. Wait, maybe the term "止蝕" is a noun. For example, "設定止蝕" (set the stop loss). So in that case, the pos would be "名詞".

But the example sentence "我止蝕咗" would be a verb. So perhaps the term can be both a noun and a verb. But the user's example for "溜冰場" is a noun. So maybe for "止蝕", the pos is "名詞" when referring to the stop loss mechanism, and "動詞" when referring to the action. But how to handle this in the dictionary entry?

The user's example shows only one pos. So perhaps we need to choose the most common usage. In financial contexts, "止蝕" is often used as a verb, as in "止蝕離場" (cut losses and exit). So the pos would be "動詞".

Therefore, the entry would be:

# 止蝕
(pos:動詞)
<explanation>
yue:喺投資或者交易時，當虧損到一定程度就停止，避免更大損失
eng:cut losses or stop loss
<eg>
yue:我今日止蝕咗。 (ng5 jat1 jat6 zi2 sap3 zo2.)
eng:I cut my losses today.

But the Cantonese explanation might need to be adjusted. Let's try to make it more Cantonese-like. For example, "投資時輸到一定程度就停，唔好輸更多" (When investing, stop when you've lost to a certain extent, don't lose more). That's more colloquial.

So the explanation would be:

yue:投資或者交易時，輸到一定程度就停，避免輸更多
eng:cut losses or stop loss

But need to make sure the characters are correct. "蝕" is the correct character for loss in this context. So the
