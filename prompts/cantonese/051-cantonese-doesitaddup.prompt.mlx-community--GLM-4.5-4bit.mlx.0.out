That's a fascinating and explosive comment. To analyze whether I "buy the story," I need to break it down into its components, assess its plausibility, and weigh the evidence for and against its credibility.

Here is a detailed explanation of my analysis.

### Summary of the Allegation

The commenter claims to be a former colleague of the award-winning police officer, Chan Tai Man, at a "major British bank." The core allegations are:
1.  **Theft/Fraud:** Chan was fired for "衰穿櫃桶底" (a Cantonese idiom meaning to be caught red-handed for embezzlement or theft, literally "breaking the bottom of the cash drawer").
2.  **Threat of Arrest:** His boss gave him an ultimatum: leave immediately or be reported to the police.
3.  **Humiliating Exit:** He was escorted out of the building by senior management and security in the afternoon to clear his desk.
4.  **Career Change:** This incident led him to join the police force.
5.  **Character Flaw:** The commenter asserts Chan has a "character problem" and questions how he passed the police vetting process.

### Analysis: Do I Buy the Story?

The short answer is: **I am highly skeptical, but I cannot definitively prove it false.** The story is designed to be believable and damaging, but it contains several red flags and logical leaps that make it questionable.

Let's break it down point by point.

#### Arguments FOR Buying the Story (Why it *Could* be True)

1.  **Specificity of Detail:** The comment is not vague. It uses a very specific and vivid idiom ("衰穿櫃桶底") and describes a plausible scenario for a financial institution's firing (immediate exit, security escort). This level of detail can make a story seem more credible.
2.  **Plausibility of Career Change:** It is not unheard of for someone who fails in one high-trust profession (like banking) to try their luck in another (like policing). The commenter provides a simple, if cynical, narrative for *why* Chan became a police officer: as a backup plan.
3.  **The "Character Flaw" Accusation:** This is a common tactic in anonymous online attacks. It's a subjective judgment that is impossible to disprove. By framing the alleged past action as evidence of a permanent character flaw, the commenter makes the entire accusation seem more substantial.
4.  **Anonymity of the Accuser:** While often a red flag, the commenter's anonymity is also what allows them to make such a claim without fear of immediate legal recourse (like a defamation lawsuit). People with genuine "insider" information often use anonymity to protect themselves.

#### Arguments AGAINST Buying the Story (Why it is Likely False)

This is where the story starts to fall apart under scrutiny.

1.  **The Biggest Flaw: The Police Vetting Process:** This is the most critical and unbelievable part of the story. The commenter asks, "唔知點解會過到 vetting 個關" (I don't know how he passed the vetting process), but this is a rhetorical question that exposes the story's weakness.
    *   **What is Vetting?** Police vetting, especially for a disciplined force like the Hong Kong Police Force, is an extremely rigorous and comprehensive background check. It is not a simple formality.
    *   **What it Involves:** Vetting would include:
        *   **Criminal Record Check:** A formal report to the police for embezzlement would result in an arrest and a criminal record. This is an automatic disqualifier. Even if the boss didn't report it, the vetting process would still uncover it.
        *   **Employment History:** Vetting officers contact previous employers. They don't just ask for dates of employment; they often ask about the reason for leaving and conduct. A major British bank would have an HR department that would, at a minimum, confirm the date of termination. In many cases, they would state that the employee was dismissed for gross misconduct (theft/fraud). This is a massive red flag.
        *   **Financial Status:** Vetting includes a credit and financial history check. Someone who was fired for stealing from a bank would likely have financial problems or a record of the incident that would surface here.
    *   **Conclusion:** It is **virtually impossible** for someone to be fired for theft from a major financial institution and then pass the police vetting process. The commenter's feigned surprise at this point is the story's undoing. If the story were true, the answer to "how did he pass vetting?" would be "he didn't," which contradicts the premise that he is now a serving, award-winning officer.

2.  **Logical Inconsistencies in the Firing:**
    *   **"Report or Leave" Ultimatum:** While this happens, it's more common in smaller companies. A "major British bank" would have strict, codified procedures for handling fraud and theft. They would almost certainly involve internal audit, legal counsel, and a formal report to the police. Letting a thief walk away scot-free exposes the bank to massive liability and is against standard corporate governance. The risk of that person doing it again elsewhere is high.
    *   **The "Shadowing" Detail:** The commenter remembers him because he was shadowing him in his first week. This adds a personal touch, but it's also a convenient narrative device. It establishes a reason for the commenter to know the junior employee well and to feel personally wronged or invested in his downfall, making the story more emotional and compelling.

3.  **Motivation of the Commenter (Cui Bono?):** Who benefits from this comment?
    *   The commenter is anonymous and gains nothing tangible.
    *   The only outcome is to damage the reputation of an award-winning police officer.
    *   This strongly suggests the motivation is malice, jealousy, or a political agenda. The commenter may have a personal grudge against the officer (perhaps they were rivals, or the commenter was fired themselves), or they may be ideologically opposed to the police and are using this as a tool to discredit the force. The story is perfectly crafted to cause maximum reputational damage.

### Conclusion

While the story is told with specific details that give it a veneer of credibility, **I do not buy it.**

The central claim—that someone fired for theft from a bank could pass the rigorous police vetting process—is the story's fatal flaw. It demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding (or a willful ignorance) of how background checks for law enforcement work. The police vetting system is specifically designed to catch people with exactly this kind of history.

The comment is far more likely to be a malicious fabrication by someone with a grudge against the officer or the police force in general. It is a classic example of a "poison pen" letter, using a plausible-sounding but ultimately unbelievable anecdote to smear a person's reputation. The commenter's final rhetorical question about vetting is not a sign of genuine confusion; it's the crack in the story's foundation that reveals it to be a lie.
