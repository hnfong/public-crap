Alright, I need to read the provided text and answer four questions based on it. Let me first understand what the text is about.

The text starts with a long explanation about the author's feelings regarding their "宝物" in their life. It mentions various colors and events, like "拍手拍片都算意料之内的" and "大叫encore!" followed by some emojis. It then goes into a more emotional and humorous part about the author reacting to something, leading to a conclusion that they should "转身" and "吃屎" or "食到傻" and "食到傻" again. It also ends with a quote about Hong Kong people not being "撚" and advises to "听热咖啡" and "live".

Now, the questions to answer:

(0) Simplify the above text.

(1) Who is the author?

(2) Why did he get angry?

(3) What does "睇live" mean?

(4) Rephrase the original text with appropriate and suitable comparison words.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

(0) Simplify the text: It seems to be a long, somewhat humorous and emotional message from the author about their feelings regarding their life, perhaps a personal reflection or a humorous advice.

(1) Author is the person mentioned in the text, probably the user or the person writing this text, given the context.

(2) He gets angry because he feels unappreciated or because he feels the author is being too harsh or because he's upset about something.

(3) "睇live" refers to "live" or "live" in the context of live streaming or live events. It's a common phrase meaning live in person.

(4) Rephrase the original text with appropriate comparison. Maybe use "compelling" or "intense" instead of "simpler" or "simpler".

Now, let me structure the answers.

For (0), perhaps something like: The text is a personal reflection or humorous message from the author discussing their feelings about their life, perhaps about their "宝物" or something similar.

(1) The author is the person who wrote this text.

(2) He gets angry because he feels unappreciated or because he's upset about something, possibly due to the author's comments.

(3) "睇live" means "live" or refers to live streaming or live events.

(4) Maybe rephrase the text to something like: "This text is a heartfelt and humorous reflection from the author about their feelings regarding their life, their unappreciation, and their reactions to certain events."

Now putting it all together in the required format.
