**Rewritten Essay in English:**

Three hours ago, after work, I went home and went online. I saw someone mourning #Yu Ying-shih. At that time, I only knew that he was a hero of Professor #Wang Wei-xiong, a well-known blogger. Apart from that, I knew nothing about his life.

However, in the 21st century, you don’t need to ask every teacher. With Google, you can know everything. After doing some research, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wang admired him so much.

Yu Ying-shih was a professor at three Ivy League universities! That’s impressive! Just the fact that he was a professor at such prestigious institutions is already shocking!

I became like a stalker, digging up all the background information on Yu Ying-shih: how the Chinese Wikipedia describes him, how the English Wikipedia describes him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how the obituaries today describe him. In my mind, I began to imagine the person I most respect—Master Yun Gen. It’s really strange!

Unfortunately, Master Yun Gen didn’t have a professorship at Harvard, but his traditional Chinese scholarship—#Bo Gu Tong Jing (versed in both ancient and modern) and #Wo Ji Huaxia (I am the Chinese)—was definitely in the same vein. Master Yun Gen loved Daoism and Buddhism, while Yu Ying-shih seemed to be a fan of Confucianism.

But that’s a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness, as well as hierarchy and respect for authority. However, if you are studying for a PhD at one of America’s top universities during the era of the counterculture movement, you might find it difficult to follow the Confucian ideals of #Respect for Teachers and #Individualism. That would lead to conflict.

So, how can scholars avoid conflict? That’s the wisdom that Confucius spent his whole life acquiring. His students couldn’t have failed to understand it: during Confucius’ time, the world was on the brink of chaos. He traveled from state to state, hoping to find a position to do something meaningful. But he only knew how to quote the classics and the rites of Zhou, and he couldn’t adapt to the needs of his superiors. In the end, he failed. But failure is the mother of success, and his students advanced much more. Sima Qian wrote: “The seventy disciples of Confucius traveled to the various states, some becoming ministers and advisors, others becoming friends of scholars.” Why?

Because after generations of transmission, they began to understand the subtleties of the rulers’ expressions. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with the rulers had changed. He could speak and laugh, understanding the ruler’s needs: “Your Majesty, you even feel pity for a cow, so you must be a benevolent ruler. If you follow the Way of the King, you will succeed!”

By the end of the Warring States period, the “Confucian” strategists had mastered the art of “interviewing the ruler.” To get a position, they abandoned “benevolence” and “ritual,” and instead focused on “legalism,” a new technology. Therefore, Xunzi, as a Confucian scholar, could train students who became high-ranking officials in the Qin Dynasty. You can’t find the slightest trace of Confucius in Li Si.

Today, with over 100 countries in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than in the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian scholars have left China, the ancient land of etiquette, and arrived in the wild, militaristic United States. Are they really going to take out the *Analects* and tell people to #Mourn for Three Years?

Back then, when Confucius and his students were turned away from doors, everyone knew about it. So, in the United States, Confucian scholars must say that Confucius supports #Democracy, #Democracy is Great, and the Communist Party is doomed. That’s how you become a professor at an Ivy League school!

Some might ask: what’s the big deal? There’s no consequence! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and the Confucian tradition was destroyed during the May Fourth Movement. As the academic authority of the top universities in the post-WWII world, you might even be believed if you taught people to take drugs and flirt with women. After all, the #Theoretical Nuclear Bomb of American ideology is solid, and the Japanese people don’t believe in superstition. The consequences of that are still fresh in our memory.

So why could Yu Ying-shih translate a few sentences from the *Book of Han* into English and get a PhD, and why did several universities invite him to be a professor? #You Know Why. They want you to be on the altar of authority, to boldly declare: “Everyone here is a duck. You think Confucianism is feudal? Oh, you misunderstand! In fact, he was a democratic fighter! If you don’t have a professorship, just listen to the lecture!”

As for whether Confucianism conflicts with democracy? Honestly, these things are known to the #Sinologists. Take the Republic of China as an example. Wait, are the political systems in Taiwan really “Confucian”? The Kuomintang leaders are constantly criticizing Tsai Ing-wen. Is Confucianism played like that? Has Tsai Ing-wen ever performed rituals or worshipped the heavens? No, she hasn’t. Scientific spirit, not being a charlatan, contradicts the essence of Confucianism. Do you think using Chinese characters makes you Confucian? Do you think Confucianism is only for China?

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, and Britain is Confucian (at least, among the world’s advanced countries, they are the closest to Confucianism). The monarchs emphasize etiquette and ceremony, power is granted by heaven, and it is supreme. There is a strict hierarchy, and no one dares to challenge it. Society is thus stable. As for the successes and failures of their democratic systems, it’s not something a Chinese-American has the right to comment on.

**Comment on the Essay:**

Disregarding the sarcastic tone, the main point the author is trying to convey is that **Confucianism, as traditionally understood, is not easily adaptable to modern, Western democratic systems**, especially in the United States. The author critiques the idea that Confucian values can be directly transplanted into a modern, individualistic, and democratic context without significant reinterpretation or adaptation. He argues that Confucianism, as practiced in China, was deeply tied to a hierarchical, ritualistic, and politically structured society, which is fundamentally different from the values and structures of Western democracies. The author also questions the legitimacy of using Confucianism as a justification for modern political or academic authority in the West, suggesting that such an approach is both anachronistic and misleading. Ultimately, the essay explores the tension between traditional Confucian ideals and their reinterpretation in a modern, globalized world. [end of text]
