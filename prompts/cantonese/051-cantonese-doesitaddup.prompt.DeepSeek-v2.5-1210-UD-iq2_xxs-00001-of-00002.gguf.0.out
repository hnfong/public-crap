The story presented in the forum comment raises several red flags and seems highly dubious. Here's why I don't fully buy the story:

1. **Lack of Specifics**: The comment lacks specific details about the bank, the exact nature of the "衰穿櫃桶底" (which translates to "breaking the till" or embezzlement), and the timeframe. Without these specifics, it's hard to verify the authenticity of the claim.

2. **Vetting Process**: The comment suggests that the person passed the vetting process for becoming a police officer despite having a questionable past. Police vetting processes are generally rigorous and thorough, especially for positions involving public trust and authority. It's unlikely that someone with a history of embezzlement would pass such a process without significant evidence of rehabilitation and a clean record since the incident.

3. **Personal Bias**: The comment is presented by a "former colleague" who seems to have a negative impression of the person. This introduces a potential bias in the narrative. People may exaggerate or fabricate stories, especially if they have personal grievances or want to discredit someone.

4. **Dramatic Events**: The description of events, such as being escorted by security and being told to leave immediately or face legal action, seems overly dramatic. While such situations can occur in extreme cases, they are not typical for most workplace disciplinary actions.

5. **No Evidence**: There is no evidence provided to back up the claims. Without any documentation, witness statements, or other forms of verification, the story remains unsubstantiated.

In conclusion, while it's possible that the person mentioned in the comment had some past issues, the story as presented is likely exaggerated or fabricated. It's important to approach such claims with skepticism and seek corroborating evidence before accepting them as true. [end of text]
