The story presented in the comment is **highly questionable** and **unlikely to be true**, for several reasons. Here's a breakdown of why the story is dubious and why I would not "buy" it:

---

### 1. **Unrealistic and Inappropriate Workplace Scenario**
> "因為佢新入職頭一個禮拜跟我shadow，佢係因為衰穿櫃桶底而比人炒..."

This part claims that the person (Chen Dafan) was fired in his first week of work at a bank for "falling through the floor of a cash counter" (衰穿櫃桶底). This is **not a realistic or plausible reason** for termination in a professional setting, especially in a **major international bank** (英資大行). 

- Falling through a floor is **not a common or believable accident**, and if it were, it would likely be a **safety issue** for the entire building, not just the individual.
- Being fired for such a reason would be **extremely unusual**, and the bank would likely investigate the structural safety of the premises rather than blame the employee.
- The phrase "衰穿櫃桶底" is **colloquial and humorous**, suggesting the story is **fabricated or exaggerated**.

### 2. **Inconsistent with Police Vetting Process**
> "佢個人品有啲問題、唔知點解會過到vetting個關"

The comment claims that the person has **character issues** and is **surprised** that he passed the police vetting process. However, the **Hong Kong Police Force** has a **rigorous vetting process** that includes background checks, interviews, and psychological evaluations. If the person had serious character issues or a history of misconduct, it is **highly unlikely** he would have passed.

- The story implies that the person was **fired from a job for a bizarre reason**, which would likely show up in a background check.
- If the story were true, the vetting process would have **flagged this**, and the person would not have been accepted into the police force.

### 3. **Possible Motive for the Comment**
The comment appears to be **malicious or defamatory**, attempting to **discredit** the award recipient by spreading a **fabricated or exaggerated story**. This is a common tactic in online forums to **undermine someone's credibility** or to stir controversy.

---

### 4. **Lack of Evidence or Corroboration**
There is **no evidence** provided to support the claim — no names of the bank, no dates, no witnesses, and no documentation. The story is **anecdotal and unverifiable**, which is a red flag for **falsehood or exaggeration**.

---

### Conclusion:
**No, I do not buy the story.** It is likely a **fabricated or exaggerated account** meant to **defame** the individual who received the award. The scenario described is **implausible**, inconsistent with real-world banking and police vetting procedures, and lacks any supporting evidence. It is important to treat such comments with **skepticism** and not take them at face value. [end of text]
