Alright, I need to critique this paragraph. Let's see, the person is talking about how nowadays, pretty boys and girls are saying they can't find jobs. Actually, it's really a big sigh... They also mention needing cash to support themselves. They wonder why companies use cash to attract job seekers. They think their own qualifications don't match the cash requirements. They lack experience and education, so how can they get hired? In a market with so many people, even if they're hired, they find the work hard, dirty, with no prospects, and low pay. They mention that at 13 years old, they've been working, and they don't care about the above issues. They conclude that if your own conditions aren't good, you have no choices, and finally understand why companies can't find people.

Hmm, so the person is expressing frustration about the job market, especially targeting the use of cash incentives by companies to attract job seekers. They feel that their own qualifications are lacking, making it hard to get hired. They also seem to be questioning the effectiveness of cash incentives and the overall job market conditions. Their conclusion is that without good qualifications, there are no choices, which explains why companies struggle to find suitable candidates.

I agree with the person's frustration to some extent. The job market can be challenging, and cash incentives might not be the best solution if the underlying issues are lack of qualifications or experience. However, companies might use cash incentives as a temporary measure to attract talent, especially in competitive industries. It's also possible that the person's self-assessment is too low, and they might have untapped potential or skills that are valuable in certain roles. Additionally, the lack of experience and education can be addressed through training or further education, which might improve their employability.

Overall, while the person's situation is challenging, it's important to consider various factors that contribute to job market dynamics and personal employability.

The individual is expressing frustration about the current job market, particularly regarding the use of cash incentives by companies to attract job seekers. He feels that his own qualifications, such as lack of experience and education, make it difficult to secure employment. He observes that despite a large number of people in the market, finding suitable jobs is challenging, leading to low-paying and undesirable positions. His conclusion is that without improving his own qualifications, he has limited choices, which explains why companies struggle to find suitable candidates.

I agree with his frustration to a certain extent. The job market can be competitive, and cash incentives might not address the root issues of qualifications and experience. However, it's also important to recognize that personal development and continuous learning can enhance employability. Additionally, companies might use cash incentives as a short-term strategy to attract talent, which could be a reflection of broader issues in the job market. Overall, while the situation is challenging, a combination of personal improvement and market adjustments could lead to better employment outcomes.
