Alright, I need to critique this paragraph. Let's see, the person is talking about how nowadays, pretty boys and girls are complaining that they can't find jobs. He says it's actually a big problem. He mentions that companies are using cash bonuses to attract job seekers, but he's confused because his own qualifications don't match the cash bonuses. He feels that without experience or education, it's hard to get hired. He also points out that the job market is crowded, making it even harder to stand out. He mentions that even at 13 years old, he's been working, but he's not sure if that helps. He concludes that if your own conditions aren't good, you have no choices, and that's why companies can't find people. He thinks it's not because the offers are not good, but because the people themselves have problems.

Hmm, so the person is expressing frustration about the job market and feels that his own shortcomings are making it difficult to find employment. He's also questioning why companies are offering cash bonuses and feels that without the right qualifications, it's challenging to secure a job. He seems to believe that the root of the problem lies in the job seekers themselves rather than the offers provided by companies.

I agree with his conclusion that personal qualifications play a significant role in finding employment. However, I think it's also important to consider the broader economic and societal factors that influence the job market. Companies offering cash bonuses might be trying to attract a certain demographic, but if the overall qualifications of the job market don't align with what companies are seeking, it can create a mismatch. Additionally, the person's experience at 13 years old is interesting, but I'm not sure how relevant that is to the current job market. It might be more about the general lack of experience and education among job seekers rather than a specific issue with being young.

Overall, while I understand his frustration and agree that personal qualifications are important, I think there's more to the story in terms of how the job market operates and the factors that companies consider when hiring.

The individual is expressing frustration about the current job market, particularly the difficulty in finding employment despite the availability of attractive job opportunities. He feels that his own qualifications, such as lack of experience and education, are hindering his ability to secure a job. Additionally, he questions why companies are offering cash bonuses to attract job seekers and believes that the root of the problem lies in the job seekers themselves rather than the offers provided by companies. While I understand his frustration and agree that personal qualifications are crucial, I also believe that broader economic and societal factors play a significant role in the job market dynamics. Therefore, while I agree with his conclusion that personal qualifications are important, I think it's essential to consider other factors that contribute to the challenges in finding employment.
