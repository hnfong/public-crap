Of course. Here is the conversation translated into simple English:

**Alice:**
Haha.
Yeah. Me too.
I like to play very much.
But I never gamble, though. :)

**Bob:**
Oh... I never gamble on Big 2 either, except for that time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**
A few weeks ago? Joe's place?

**Bob:**
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big 2.
I said, "Okay, let's play."
He said, "One cent per card..." (because he plays very well).
I thought, "So what?" Besides, at most I'd lose about $10.

**Alice:**
Then you went for it.
:)
Hehe. You were brave to try it.
It's actually good. But if you have to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**
But it's not very good to be so stubborn...
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**
What program?
No.
You don't need to download anything or anything. :)

**Bob:**
Well, to play online, of course you need a program to play.
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... wait...

**Alice:**
How about that. :)
Don't bother.
Hehe. [end of text]
