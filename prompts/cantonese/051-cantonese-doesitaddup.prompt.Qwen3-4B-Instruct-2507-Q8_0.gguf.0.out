The comment you've shared appears to be a **fictional or exaggerated story**, and **I do not buy it as a credible account** of the person receiving the award. Here's a breakdown of why:

---

### 1. **Inconsistencies in the Narrative**
- The story claims that the person (Chen Dawen, a "distinguished police officer") was a bank employee who "wore the bottom of the counter" (a literal translation of "cabinet bottom" ‚Äî possibly meaning he was in a low-status, junior role) and was "fired" because he was "bad" or "unprofessional."
- It says the bank manager told him: *"If you don‚Äôt leave immediately, we‚Äôll report you to the police."*
- Then, the narrator says the person was "arrested" by senior staff and "taken away" ‚Äî which is **highly unlikely** in a real workplace setting, especially for a minor issue like being in a low-level role.
- The claim that he "eventually went to join the police" after this incident is **implausible** ‚Äî it would be a major life change, and such a dramatic turn would be unlikely to be reported in a casual forum comment.

---

### 2. **"Vetting" and Background Checks**
- The comment says the person "had personal issues" and "failed vetting" ‚Äî this is **contradicted by the fact** that he was awarded as an "outstanding policeman."
- If someone had serious personal or behavioral issues that led to failing vetting, they would **not** be able to become a police officer ‚Äî especially not one recognized as "outstanding."
- The idea that someone would be arrested or reported to police for being in a low-level job is **not a real or credible reason** for vetting failure.

---

### 3. **Cultural and Linguistic Issues**
- The tone and phrasing (e.g., "you don‚Äôt leave immediately, we‚Äôll report you to the police") sounds like **a humorous or exaggerated anecdote**, possibly meant to be ironic or satirical.
- The use of Cantonese phrases like "Ë°∞Á©øÊ´ÉÊ°∂Â∫ï" (to be in a low position) and "ËÄÅÁ¥∞" (a senior employee) suggests a **colloquial, informal, and possibly tongue-in-cheek** tone.
- The story may be **a joke or a parody** ‚Äî not a real event.

---

### 4. **Contradiction with the Award**
- The person is described as an "outstanding policeman" ‚Äî a public honor.
- A person with a history of being fired, arrested, or having serious personal issues would **not** be recognized in such a way.
- This creates a **clear contradiction** between the story and the public recognition.

---

### Conclusion:
> ‚ùå **No, I do not buy the story.**

It appears to be a **satirical or exaggerated anecdote**, possibly meant to:
- Highlight the absurdity of certain workplace dynamics,
- Mock the idea of "bad behavior" leading to police involvement,
- Or simply be a humorous take on a person's background.

It is **not credible** as a factual account of how Chen Dawen became a police officer or what happened in the bank.

üí° If you're reading this on a forum, it's likely a **joke, a meme, or a piece of satire** ‚Äî not a real event. Always be cautious of such stories, especially when they contradict public records or official honors.

Let me know if you'd like help analyzing the tone, cultural context, or translating the original Cantonese more accurately! [end of text]
