Okay, let's break down this paragraph. I'll give an objective overview of the situation, the problems, and then my take on the conclusion.  I'll answer in English for clarity, but I'll include some Cantonese phrasing where it feels natural.

**Objective Situation & Problems:**

The person writing this is clearly an older, working-class individual ("阿叔" - uncle, implying age and experience). He's observing a trend where attractive young people ("靚仔靚妹") are complaining about not being able to find jobs.  He's particularly fixated on the fact that some companies are offering cash-in-hand ("現金糧") wages to attract workers. 

The core problem he identifies is a mismatch between expectations and reality.  He believes these young people are complaining *despite* being unqualified.  He points out they lack experience ("冇經驗") and education ("冇學歷"), and therefore have no leverage to demand better conditions.  He contrasts this with his own experience, stating he started working at age 13 and wouldn't hesitate to take a tough, low-paying job ("辛苦污糟冇前景人工低") because he understood his own limitations.

The underlying issue, as he sees it, isn't that companies aren't offering enough, but that the job seekers themselves are the problem.  He believes the labor market is competitive ("市場咁多人"), and employers will simply hire someone else if you're not willing to accept the terms.  He concludes that the reason companies are struggling to hire isn't the job offers themselves, but the unrealistic expectations of the applicants.  He's basically saying, "If you don't have anything to offer, you don't get to complain."  He's frustrated with what he perceives as entitlement.

**Why This Problem Exists (From His Perspective):**

He believes the problem stems from a generation that hasn't faced the same hardships he has.  He implies they're spoiled or unrealistic in their job expectations.  He doesn't acknowledge systemic issues like wage stagnation, rising cost of living, or the increasing need for higher education in many fields.  His worldview is very much rooted in a "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" mentality.  He thinks if you're not good enough, you should just accept it and take whatever you can get.  He doesn't seem to consider that the job market has changed significantly since he was 13.

**Do I Agree with His Conclusion?**

No, not entirely. While there's *some* truth to his observation that unrealistic expectations can be a barrier, his conclusion is overly simplistic and dismissive.  He's ignoring the broader economic and social factors at play.  

Yes, some people are genuinely unqualified and need to adjust their expectations. But many others are facing a legitimate crisis: wages haven't kept pace with inflation, the cost of living is skyrocketing, and many entry-level jobs require qualifications that weren't necessary a generation ago.  The gig economy and precarious work have also created a situation where even qualified people struggle to find stable, well-paying jobs.

His "阿叔" perspective is valid in the sense that he's seen a lot, but it's also limited by his own experiences.  The world has changed.  Dismissing the struggles of young people as mere entitlement is unfair and ignores the systemic issues that make it harder for them to succeed.  

He's right that having no qualifications limits your options, but that doesn't mean the system is fair or that complaining about exploitative conditions is unreasonable.  The problem isn't just the workers; it's also the employers who rely on desperation to keep wages low and conditions poor.  

In Cantonese, you could say: "佢講嘅有啲道理，但係唔係全部。個世界變咗，唔可以再用舊時嘅思維睇問題。" (He's right about some things, but not everything. The world has changed, you can't look at problems with old-fashioned thinking.)
