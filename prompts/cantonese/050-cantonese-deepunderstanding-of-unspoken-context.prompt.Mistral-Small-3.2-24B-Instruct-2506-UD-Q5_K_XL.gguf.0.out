**Overview of the Situation:**

The person in the paragraph is likely an individual who is struggling to find a job in the current market. He acknowledges that many young people (靚仔靚妹) are also facing difficulties in finding employment. He has little to no work experience (冇經驗) and lacks formal education (冇學歷), which he believes makes it challenging for him to secure a job. He is also aware that companies are offering cash incentives (現金糧) to attract job seekers, but he feels that his personal conditions do not align with these offers.

**Problems Faced:**

1. **Lack of Experience and Education:** The individual feels that his lack of experience and formal education makes him unqualified for many jobs.
2. **Competitive Job Market:** He acknowledges that the job market is highly competitive, with many people vying for the same positions.
3. **Low Job Satisfaction:** He mentions that even if he were to get a job, it would likely be low-paying, dirty, and without prospects (人工低令阿叔我13歲已經出嚟做嘢完全都唔介意以上嘅問題).

**Why These Problems Exist:**

The individual attributes the difficulty in finding employees (請唔到人) not to companies not offering enough (offer唔夠), but to the job seekers themselves having issues (啲人有問題). He believes that many people, like himself, have poor personal conditions (自身條件唔好) and thus have no choice but to accept low-paying, undesirable jobs.

**Agreement with Conclusion:**

While it is true that personal conditions can affect employability, the individual's conclusion that the problem lies solely with the job seekers is overly simplistic. The job market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and company policies. Additionally, the lack of experience and education could be addressed through training programs and education reforms, which are not within the control of individual job seekers. Therefore, while personal conditions do play a role, they are not the sole factor in the difficulty of finding employment.

**English Translation:**

Seeing these good-looking guys and girls saying they can't find jobs, it's really just complaining... They want to find cash incentives, do they know why companies use cash incentives to attract job seekers? If your personal conditions don't match the cash incentives, what can you do? You have no experience, no education, what makes you think anyone will hire you? I mean, the market is so competitive, even if they do hire you, it's going to be hard, dirty, low-paying work with no future. I've been working since I was 13 and I don't even care about the above problems. If your personal conditions are bad, you basically have no choice. I finally understand why they say they can't find people to hire. It's not that companies don't offer enough, it's that these people have problems. [end of text]
