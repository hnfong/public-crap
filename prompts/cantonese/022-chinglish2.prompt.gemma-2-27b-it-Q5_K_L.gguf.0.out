## Alice and Bob's Conversation (Simplified)

**Alice:** Haha, yeah me too. I love playing cards! But I never gamble.

**Bob:** Yeah, me neither, except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:** A few weeks ago with Joe?

**Bob:** Went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big Two. I said okay, let's play. He said 1 cent per card because he's really good. I thought, "okay, fine," because I wouldn't lose more than $10 anyway.

**Alice:** You're brave!

**Alice:** It's actually fun to play without gambling. But if you were gambling, I wouldn't enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:** Yeah, it's not good to be so serious about it. If you gamble, it gets stressful.

By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:** What program?

You have to download it or something.

**Bob:** To play online, you need a program. My chat program can't send files yet. Maybe you can get it from me using ftp or http... wait...

**Alice:** Okay, no problem.

I understand.
