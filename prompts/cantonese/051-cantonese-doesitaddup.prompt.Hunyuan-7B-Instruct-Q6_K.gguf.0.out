The story is highly questionable and likely exaggerated for comedic or malicious purposes. It contains several elements that raise red flags:

1. **Physical Humiliation**: The story describes a colleague being humiliated by wearing a "caddy bucket bottom." While workplace dynamics can be challenging, publicly humiliating someone, especially in a professional setting, is not uncommon. However, the way it is phrased suggests it might be exaggerated or fabricated.

2. **Imminent Threat**: The claim that the colleague was about to resign and was "reported" by an elder colleague is suspicious. Resigning from a job is a normal career transition, and there is no reason to believe it would lead to immediate reporting or legal action.

3. **Police Training**: The story suggests that the colleague was "arrested" by security and then transferred to a police academy. This is highly improbable, as individuals transitioning into law enforcement typically go through a structured training process, not being "arrested" by security.

4. **"Vetting" Issue**: The mention of a "vetting" issue is vague and could be interpreted in various ways. It might refer to a background check or other form of scrutiny, but the context is unclear and could be misleading.

5. **General Tone**: The tone of the story is overly dramatic and seems to be designed to provoke or entertain rather than provide a factual account.

### Conclusion:
The story is likely exaggerated or fabricated for comedic or malicious purposes. It does not appear to be based on any credible evidence or factual basis. If this is a real incident, it would be important to rely on official records, reports, or credible accounts rather than unverified anecdotes.
