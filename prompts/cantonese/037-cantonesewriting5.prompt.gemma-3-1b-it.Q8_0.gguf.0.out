好嘞，我試下用「睇怕」一詞造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文翻譯：

1.  我睇怕自己咁辛苦，真係好想放鬆一下。 (I really hate myself being so hardworking, I want to relax.)
2.  佢睇怕食過度，食咗幾碗糖果就好啦。 (He hates eating too much, he ate a whole bunch of candies.)
3.  呢個問題睇怕，我唔知該點睇。 (This problem is really bothering me, I don’t know what to think.)
4.  佢睇怕聽人講嘢，好似聽啲咁嘈。 (He hates listening to people talk, he’s always so noisy.)
5.  我睇怕自己咁懶惰，唔會做任何事情。 (I hate myself being so lazy, I won’t do anything.)
6.  呢個遊戲睇怕，我唔知應該玩啲咁複雜。 (This game is really boring, I don’t know what to play.)
7.  佢睇怕自己咁唔識講，唔會話得。 (He hates himself not being able to speak, he can’t talk.)
8.  呢個問題睇怕，我唔知應該問啲咁重要嘅問題。 (This problem is really worrying me, I don’t know what to ask important questions.)
9.  我睇怕自己咁唔努力，唔會成功。 (I hate myself not working hard, I won’t succeed.)
10. 呢個計劃睇怕，我唔知應該做好啲。 (This plan is really daunting, I don’t know what to do better.)
