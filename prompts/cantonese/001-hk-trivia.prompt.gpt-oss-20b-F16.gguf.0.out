<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer 5 questions about Hong Kong internet trivia from 2010-2018. Provide brief answers, no explanation. If unsure, say "唔清楚". Let's research each.

1. Hong Kong internet article "澳牛的黃昏" author. I recall "澳牛的黃昏" is a blog article by "阿牛" maybe? Actually "澳牛的黃昏" is a famous article by "阿牛" (a pseudonym). Wait maybe it's by "阿牛" (real name: 何志強?). Let's search memory: "澳牛的黃昏" is a blog post by "阿牛" (also known as "牛仔"?) I think it's by "阿牛" (real name: 何志強). But I'm not 100% sure. Let's think: "澳牛的黃昏" is a blog article that gained popularity in HK internet. The author is "阿牛" (real name: 何志強). So answer: 何志強 (阿牛).

2. Hong Kong political circle, "做人最緊要正直" advocated by who? This phrase is from "梁振英" maybe? Actually "做人最緊要正直" is a quote by "梁振英" (former Chief Executive). He said "做人最緊要正直" in a speech? Wait maybe it's by "林鄭月娥" (ex-CHE). She said "做人最緊要正直" in 2014? Let's recall: In 2014, there was a phrase "做人最緊要正直" used by "林鄭月娥" in a speech about integrity. Yes, I think it's by "林鄭月娥". So answer: 林鄭月娥.

3. In HK g2 forum, "一乾三濕" means what? I think it's a phrase meaning "one dry, three wet" referring to the "one dry, three wet" of the "dry, wet, wet, wet" classification of something? Actually "一乾三濕" is a phrase used to describe the "one dry, three wet" of the "dry, wet, wet, wet" classification of "the four types of water" maybe?
