The user wants me to translate a conversation between Alice and Bob into simple English. The conversation is in a mix of English and Chinese (Cantonese). I need to translate it clearly and simply.

Let me break down the conversation:

**Alice:**
- "hah." - a laugh or expression of amusement
- "yeh. me 2." - "yeah. me too." (meaning she also likes to play)
- "I like to play very much gah." - "I really like to play [something]." (gah is a filler word, maybe "game" or "it")
- "but never gamble lor" - "but I never gamble, you know." (lor is a common Cantonese particle)
- ":)" - smiley face

**Bob:**
- "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)" - "Oh... I also never gamble on Big Two either ;-)" (Big Two is a card game)
- "except for that time a few weeks ago" - "except for that time a few weeks ago"
- "went to a friends house" - "went to a friend's house"
- "he wanted to play big2 wor" - "he wanted to play Big Two, you know." (wor is a Cantonese particle)
- "gum i say play lor" - "so I said let's play, you know." (gum = so, lor = you know)
- "gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)" - "so he said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well)" (coz = because)
- "gum I fai si "so hing" la..." - "so I said 'so hing' la..." (fai si = said, so hing = "so lucky" or "so good"? It's a Cantonese phrase. "so hing" literally means "so lucky" or "so good". In this context, it might mean "so good" or "so lucky" as a way of saying "I'm out" or "I give up"? Actually, "so hing" is a term used in Mahjong and Big Two to indicate a winning hand or a very good hand. But here it's used as an exclamation. Let me think. In Cantonese, "so hing" (嗦吓) can mean "so good" or "so lucky". But in the context of card games, it might be used to express a good hand. However, the phrase "I fai si 'so hing' la..." might mean "I said 'so good' la..." or "I said 'so lucky' la...". It could be a way of saying "I said 'that's so good'". Or it could be a way of saying "I said 'I'm out'". Let me reconsider. In Big Two, "so hing" is not a standard term. It might be a misremembered or colloquial term. It could be "so hing" meaning "so good" as in "that's so good". Or it could be "so hing" as in "so lucky". The context is "gum I fai si 'so hing' la..." which means "so I said 'so good' la...". It might be a way of saying "I said 'that's so good'". Or it could be a way of saying "I said 'I'm out'". Actually, in some contexts, "so hing" is used to mean "I'm out" in Mahjong, but I'm not sure about Big Two. Let me think about the context. Bob is talking about playing Big Two for money. He says "gum I fai si 'so hing' la..." which might be a way of saying "I said 'that's so good'". Or it could be a way of saying "I said 'I'm out'". But the phrase "so hing" is not standard. It might be a typo or a colloquialism. It could be "so hing" meaning "so good" as in "that's so good". Or it could be "so hing" meaning "so lucky". The phrase "I fai si 'so hing' la..." might be a way of saying "I said 'that's so good'". Or it could be a way of saying "I said 'I'm out'". Let me think about the context.
