**Overview of the Situation (Objective Analysis):**

The speaker is a young person—likely in their late teens or early twenties—expressing frustration about the current job market, particularly the difficulty in finding employment despite the availability of jobs. He observes that many young people (referred to as "handsome boys and girls") are struggling to find work, and he attributes this not to a lack of job openings, but to the poor qualifications and unpreparedness of job seekers themselves.

He highlights several key issues:
- Many job seekers lack formal education or work experience.
- They are unwilling to accept low-paying or undesirable jobs (e.g., those with low wages, poor conditions, or no future prospects).
- He contrasts this with his own family background—mentioning that his father started working at age 13 with no education or qualifications, and that he didn’t mind hard work or low pay.
- He argues that companies are offering "cash wages" (likely meaning informal, off-the-books payments) not because they are exploitative, but because they are trying to attract people who are willing to work under such conditions.
- His core argument is that the real problem isn’t a shortage of jobs, but a mismatch between job seekers’ expectations and their actual qualifications.

**Why This Situation Exists:**

The underlying causes are structural and societal:
- The education system may not be adequately preparing youth for the workforce.
- There is a growing gap between the skills employers need and those that young people possess.
- Economic pressures have led to a rise in informal or "cash-in-hand" jobs, especially in sectors like retail, hospitality, and construction.
- Young people today have higher expectations—seeking not just income, but dignity, stability, and career growth—unlike previous generations who accepted harsh conditions out of necessity.
- There is also a generational shift in values: younger people are less willing to tolerate poor working conditions, even if it means longer unemployment.

**Evaluation of the Conclusion:**

The speaker concludes that "companies can’t hire people because the people themselves are the problem"—a view that is **overly simplistic and ultimately flawed**.

While it’s true that some job seekers lack experience or qualifications, **blaming the unemployed for the hiring shortage ignores systemic issues**:
- Employers often fail to provide training, fair wages, or career progression, making jobs unattractive even to qualified candidates.
- The rise of informal employment (cash wages) is not just a recruitment tool—it’s often a sign of labor exploitation and tax evasion, which harms both workers and the economy.
- Expecting young people to accept the same harsh conditions as previous generations (e.g., working at 13 with no education) is unrealistic and ethically questionable. Society has evolved, and so should our standards of fair labor.
- The real issue is not that "people are the problem," but that **the system is failing to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers**—through better education, vocational training, apprenticeships, and fairer labor policies.

**Final Verdict:**

I **disagree** with the speaker’s conclusion. While personal responsibility and self-improvement are important, placing the entire burden on job seekers ignores structural inequalities and the changing nature of work. The solution lies not in blaming the unemployed, but in reforming education, improving job quality, and creating pathways for youth to enter the workforce with dignity and opportunity.
