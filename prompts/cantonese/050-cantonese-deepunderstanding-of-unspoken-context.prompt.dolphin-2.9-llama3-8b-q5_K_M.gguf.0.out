The person in this paragraph is expressing their frustration with the current job market. They mention that many young people are struggling to find employment, and that companies are using cash incentives to attract job seekers. The writer questions the effectiveness of these incentives, as they themselves lack experience and education, making them an unlikely choice for employers. They also mention that the low wages and lack of job security in the market make it difficult for people to find suitable work. The writer concludes that the reason why companies are unable to attract qualified candidates is due to the insufficient offers they provide, which ultimately reflects the problems within the job market. I agree with the writer's conclusion that the job market has its issues, but I would also suggest that there may be other factors at play, such as a lack of job training programs or a mismatch between job seekers' skills and the available positions.
