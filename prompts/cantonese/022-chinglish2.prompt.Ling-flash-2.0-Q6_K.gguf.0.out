Here's the conversation between Alice and Bob translated into simple English:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha.  
Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play games.  
But I never gamble, okay?  
:)

**Bob:**  
Oh no... I never gamble in Big2 either;-)  
Except for that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, Joe Mud’s place?  

**Bob:**  
Went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big2, so I played.  
He said, “Just 1 cent per card...” (because he’s really good).  
I thought, “Okay, so what?” Besides, at most I’d lose like $10, right?

**Alice:**  
Okay, that’s fine.  
:)  
Hehe. You know, if you always gamble, the game isn’t as fun for me.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to “play too seriously,” right?  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it gets really stressful...  
By the way, do you have the game program?

**Alice:**  
I don’t have the program.  
Maybe you haven’t downloaded it yet?  
:)

**Bob:**  
Of course you need the program to play online.  
My version doesn’t support file sharing yet... Maybe I can send it to you via FTP or HTTP... Wait...

**Alice:**  
Oh no...  
:)  
No need to trouble yourself.  
Hehe.

Let me know if you'd like it even simpler or more casual! [end of text]
