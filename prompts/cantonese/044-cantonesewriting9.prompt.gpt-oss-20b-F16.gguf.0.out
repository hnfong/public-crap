<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for the phrase "從頭再嚟". We need to follow the format:

```
# 從頭再嚟
(pos:??)
<explanation>
yue:...
eng:...
<eg>
yue:...
eng:...
```

We need to decide part of speech: It's a phrase meaning "start over" or "do again from the beginning". It could be a verb phrase or an idiom. In Cantonese, "從頭再嚟" is a phrase meaning "to start over again" or "to do something again from the beginning". It can be used as a verb phrase or an idiom. So we can label it as (verb phrase) or (idiom). In dictionary, we might use (verb phrase) or (idiom). Let's choose (verb phrase) or (idiom). The example uses (pos:名詞). So we can use (pos:動詞短語) or (pos:動詞). But we can also use (pos:動詞短語). Let's use (pos:動詞短語). Or we can use (pos:動詞). But "從頭再嚟" is a phrase that functions as a verb phrase. So we can use (pos:動詞短語). Let's do that.

Now explanation: In Cantonese: "從頭再嚟" 係指重新開始，從頭開始做某件事。English: "to start over again" or "to do something again from the beginning".

Examples: "你唔好再講錯，從頭再嚟一次。" (Don't keep making mistakes, start over again.) Or "我哋要從頭再嚟，重新安排計劃。" (We need to start over again and rearrange the plan.)

We need to provide example sentences in Cantonese and English. Use romanization with tone numbers? The example uses romanization with tone numbers: "lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2." So we need to provide romanization for the Cantonese example. Use Jyutping with tone numbers. Provide English translation.

Let's produce:

```
# 從頭再嚟
(pos:動詞短語)
<explanation>
yue:從頭再嚟係指重新開始，從頭做某件事。 (從頭再嚟)
eng:to start over again, to do something again from the beginning.
<eg>
yue:你唔好再講錯，從頭再嚟一次。 (nei5 m4 hou2 zoi6 gong2 co3, cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4 jat1 ci3.)
eng:Don't keep making mistakes, start over again.
```

But we need to include the phrase "從頭再嚟" in the explanation? The explanation can be "從頭再嚟係指重新開始，從頭做某件事。" That is fine.

We also need to include the phrase "從頭再嚟" in the example? The example uses the phrase "從頭再嚟" in the sentence. So we need to include it. The example: "你唔好再講錯，從頭再嚟一次。" That includes the phrase. Provide romanization: "nei5 m4 hou2 zoi6 gong2 co3, cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4 jat1 ci3." Wait, "從頭再嚟" romanization: "cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4". Actually "從頭" is "cung4 tau4". "再嚟" is "zoi3 lei4". So "cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4". So the romanization: "nei5 m4 hou2 zoi6 gong2 co3, cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4 jat1 ci3." That is correct.

But we need to ensure the romanization uses tone numbers. Yes.

Now we need to produce the dictionary entry. Let's produce:

```
# 從頭再嚟
(pos:動詞短語)
<explanation>
yue:從頭再嚟係指重新開始，從頭做某件事。 (從頭再嚟)
eng:to start over again, to do something again from the beginning.
<eg>
yue:你唔好再講錯，從頭再嚟一次。 (nei5 m4 hou2 zoi6 gong2 co3, cung4 tau4 zoi3 lei4 jat1 ci3.)
eng:Don't keep making mistakes, start over again.
```

But we might want to include a second example. The example section can include multiple examples. The example section in the sample only has one example. But we can include one example. It's okay.

We need to ensure the formatting: The sample uses:

```
# 溜冰場
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink
<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.
```

So we need to follow that. Use "yue:" and "eng:" lines. The explanation lines can be multiple lines. The example lines can be multiple lines. The romanization is inside parentheses after the Cantonese example. The English translation is after "eng:".

We need to ensure we use "yue:" and "eng:" lines. The explanation lines can be multiple lines. The example lines can be multiple lines. The romanization inside parentheses after the Cantonese example. The English translation after "eng:".

We need to ensure we use "從頭再嚟" as the phrase. The explanation: "從頭再嚟係指重新開始，從頭做某件事。" That is fine.

Now we need to produce the final answer. Let's produce the dictionary entry accordingly.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 從頭再嚟
