<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for phrase "從頭再嚟". Format: # phrase, (pos:??). It's a phrase, maybe idiom, meaning "to start over again" or "to do something again from the beginning". In Cantonese, "從頭再嚟" means "to start over again" or "to do again from the start". So pos: idiom? Could be "idiom" or "phrase". In dictionary, maybe "idiom" or "phrase". Use (pos:成語) or (pos:短語). But the example uses (pos:名詞). For phrase, maybe (pos:成語). But we can use (pos:成語). Provide explanation in Cantonese and English. Provide example sentence in Cantonese with romanization and English translation.

We need to use Cantonese grammar: "從頭再嚟" is "從頭再嚟" (cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4). Provide explanation: "指重新開始，從頭做起" etc. Provide example: "我哋試下從頭再嚟，唔好再犯錯" (ngo5 dei6 si3 haa6 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4, m4 hou2 zoi6 faan6 co3). Provide English translation: "Let's try again from the beginning, don't make the same mistake again."

Also maybe mention usage: "從頭再嚟" can be used when someone wants to redo something. Provide example: "佢講錯，佢要從頭再嚟" (keoi5 gong2 co3, keoi5 jiu3 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4). Provide translation: "He said it wrong, he needs to start over again."

We need to produce the entry with the same format: # phrase, (pos:??). Provide <explanation> with Cantonese and English. Provide <eg> with Cantonese and English.

Let's produce:

# 從頭再嚟
(pos:成語)
<explanation>
yue:指重新開始，從頭做起。常用於表示要重新做一次，或重新開始一件事。  
eng:Means to start over again, to redo something from the beginning. Often used to indicate that one should redo something or restart a task.

<eg>
yue:佢講錯，佢要從頭再嚟。 (keoi5 gong2 co3, keoi5 jiu3 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4.)  
eng:He made a mistake, so he has to start over again.

Also maybe second example: "我哋試下從頭再嚟，唔好再犯錯。" (ngo5 dei6 si3 haa6 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4, m4 hou2 zoi6 faan6 co3.)  
eng:Let's try again from the beginning, don't make the same mistake again.

But we only need one example? The example section can have multiple examples. The example format: <eg> yue: ... (romanization). eng: ... So we can include two examples separated by line breaks. But the example section may contain multiple <eg> tags? The example shows only one <eg> block. But we can include multiple lines inside <eg> block. The example block can contain multiple lines. Let's keep one example for simplicity.

But we can include two examples separated by line breaks. The example block can contain multiple lines. Let's do:

<eg>
yue:佢講錯，佢要從頭再嚟。 (keoi5 gong2 co3, keoi5 jiu3 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4.)  
eng:He made a mistake, so he has to start over again.

But we might also include second example: "我哋試下從頭再嚟，唔好再犯錯。" (ngo5 dei6 si3 haa6 cung4 tau4 zoi3 loi4, m4 hou2 zoi6 faan6 co3.)  
eng:Let's try again from the beginning, don't make the same mistake again.

But the example block may not allow multiple examples? The example block can contain multiple lines. It's okay.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 從頭再嚟
