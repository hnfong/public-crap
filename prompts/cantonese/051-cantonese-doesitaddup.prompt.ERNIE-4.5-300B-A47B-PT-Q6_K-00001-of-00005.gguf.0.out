The story raises several red flags and lacks sufficient credibility for several reasons:

### 1. **Vague and Unsubstantiated Claims**  
   - The commenter provides no concrete evidence (e.g., names, dates, job titles, or specific incidents) to support their claims about Chen’s alleged misconduct. Terms like “衰穿櫃桶底” (a vague accusation of dishonesty) and “人品有啲問題” (vague character flaws) are subjective and unverifiable.  
   - The lack of details makes it impossible to fact-check the claims or assess their plausibility.

### 2. **Inconsistencies in the Narrative**  
   - The commenter claims Chen was fired for an unspecified offense (“衰穿櫃桶底”) and threatened with legal action, yet provides no context (e.g., theft, fraud, or policy violations).  
   - The abrupt dismissal scenario—being escorted out by security the same day—is unusual for most professional settings, especially in a major bank, unless the offense was extremely severe (e.g., violence or gross misconduct). No such severity is implied.

### 3. **Questionable Motivation**  
   - The commenter does not explain why they are sharing this information publicly, especially years after the fact. If the goal was to expose wrongdoing, why wait until Chen receives an award?  
   - The tone suggests possible jealousy, resentment, or an attempt to tarnish Chen’s reputation without justification.

### 4. **Unrealistic Vetting Process**  
   - The commenter claims Chen “passed vetting” despite alleged character flaws. However, police vetting is rigorous and includes background checks, references, and interviews. If Chen had a history of dishonesty or termination for cause, it would likely surface during vetting.  
   - The commenter provides no insight into how Chen might have circumvented this process, making the claim implausible.

### 5. **Cultural and Linguistic Ambiguity**  
   - The use of colloquial Cantonese phrases (e.g., “衰穿櫃桶底”) may obscure the severity of the alleged offense. Without a clear translation or explanation, the accusations remain nebulous.  
   - The commenter’s identity as a “前同事” (former colleague) is not verified, and there is no way to confirm their relationship with Chen.

### 6. **Logical Gaps**  
   - The commenter implies that Chen’s past behavior should disqualify him from receiving an award, yet fails to connect the alleged misconduct to his current role as a policeman.  
   - There is no mention of Chen’s performance as a police officer, his achievements, or any evidence linking his past to present conduct.

### Conclusion:  
The story is highly dubious due to its vagueness, lack of evidence, and inconsistencies. It reads more like a personal attack or gossip than a credible account. Without corroborating details or proof, there is no reason to believe the claims. It is possible the commenter is motivated by malice or misinformation, rather than truth. [end of text]
