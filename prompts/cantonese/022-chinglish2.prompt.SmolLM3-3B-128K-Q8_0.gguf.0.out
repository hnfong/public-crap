Alice: Hah. Yeah, me too. I like to play a lot of games, but I never gamble.

Bob: Oh, right. I never gamble on big stakes either, except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice: A few weeks ago, Joe came over. He wanted to play big2. I agreed to play, but he said it would cost 1 cent for a card because he's really good at it. I said "so hing" (meaning "no thanks") and added that I wouldn't lose more than $10.

Alice: Gum yau hai (laughing). Hehe. Let's not gamble. It's good actually, but if you do gamble, I won't enjoy the game thoroughly.

Bob: But it's not good to "stand so hard" (meaning "play so much"). Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful.

Bob: BTW, do you have the program?

Alice: Meh program. I can download it.

Bob: You need a program to play online, of course. My client doesn't support file transfers yet. Maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP... Wait...

Alice: Hoe ark. (Laughing) I'm coming over. Hehe. [end of text]
