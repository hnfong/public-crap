參照以上例子，用用廣東話「睇怕」一詞，造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文嘅翻譯。"

We need to produce 10 sentences using the Cantonese term "睇怕". Provide English translations. Use Cantonese grammar, not Mandarin. Use "嘅" instead of "的", "係" instead of "是". Provide # 詞: 睇怕 heading. Then list 1-10 sentences with English translations in parentheses.

Make sure each sentence uses "睇怕" correctly. "睇怕" means "to be afraid of something, to be scared of something, to think something is scary". Usually used as "我睇怕佢會唔會..." meaning "I'm afraid that...". So we can create sentences like:

1. 我睇怕今晚會落雨，唔好出街。 (I'm afraid it will rain tonight, better not go out.)
2. 佢睇怕考試唔合格，所以日日溫書。 (He/she is afraid of failing the exam, so studies every day.)
3. 老闆睇怕客人唔滿意，特別留意服務質素。 (The boss is afraid that customers might be dissatisfied, so pays special attention to service quality.)
4. 我哋睇怕呢條路會塞車，決定改走旁邊條街。 (We are afraid this road will be jammed, so decide to take the side street.)
5. 媽媽睇怕我夜晚太遲先返屋企，叫我早啲返。 (Mom is afraid I will come home too late at night, so asks me to return early.)
6. 佢哋睇怕疫情再度爆發，已經開始儲備防護用品。 (They are afraid the pandemic might flare up again, so have started stockpiling protective gear.)
7. 我睇怕佢唔會接受呢個提議，所以先準備備用方案。 (I'm afraid he won't accept this proposal, so I prepared a backup plan.)
8. 佢睇怕自己講錯嘢會尷尬，於是保持沉默。 (He is afraid of saying something wrong and feeling embarrassed, so stays silent.)
9. 我哋睇怕電腦會中病毒，已經安裝防毒軟件。 (We are afraid the computer might get a virus, so have installed antivirus software.)
10. 佢睇怕自己唔夠格做領導，於是努力提升自己。 (He is afraid he is not qualified to be a leader, so works hard to improve himself.)

Make sure to use Cantonese characters and grammar. Use "睇怕" as a verb phrase. Provide English translations in parentheses after each sentence.

Let's format as:

# 詞: 睇怕

1. ... (English)
...
10. ...

Make sure to use Cantonese style: "我哋", "佢", "唔", "係", "嘅". Use "係" for "is". Use "嘅" for possessive.

Check each sentence for Cantonese grammar: Use "睇怕" after subject: "我睇怕...", "佢睇怕...", "老闆睇怕...", "我哋睇怕...", "媽媽睇怕...", "佢哋睇怕...", "我睇怕...", "佢睇怕...", "我哋睇怕...", "佢睇怕...". Good.
