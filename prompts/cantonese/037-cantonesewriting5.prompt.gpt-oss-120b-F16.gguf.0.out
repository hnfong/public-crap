參照以上例子，用用廣東話「睇怕」一詞，造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文嘅翻譯。"

We need to produce 10 sentences using the Cantonese term "睇怕". Provide English translations. Use Cantonese grammar, not Mandarin. Use "嘅" instead of "的". Use "係" instead of "是". Provide # 詞: 睇怕. Then list 1-10 sentences with translations in parentheses.

We must ensure we use Cantonese style. "睇怕" means "to be afraid of seeing something" or "to be scared of something". Actually "睇怕" is a Cantonese phrase meaning "to be scared of something, to be afraid of something (like a person is scared of a situation)". It can be used like "佢睇怕黑" (He is afraid of the dark). Or "我睇怕佢會唔開心" (I'm afraid that he might be unhappy). So we need to create sentences.

Make sure to use Cantonese characters and grammar. Provide English translations.

Let's produce:
