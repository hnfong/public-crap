## Alice:
Hah.
Yeah. Me too.
I like to play a lot gah.
But I never gamble.
:) 

## Bob:
Orr... I never gamble on Big2 either ;-)
Except for that time a few weeks ago.

## Alice:
A few weeks ago Joe Mud ah?

## Bob:
I went to a friend's house.
He wanted to play Big2.
So I said let's play.
He said 1 cent for a card... (because he plays very well).
I said "so hard" besides, at most I would lose something like $10.

## Alice:
Yeah.
:) 
Hehe. Let's go see if you have the program.
It's good actually. But if you want to gamble, I wouldn't enjoy the game thoroughly.

## Bob:
But it's not very good to "stand so hard"...
Yeah, if you need to gamble, it's very stressful...
By the way, do you have the program?

## Alice:
No program.
No.
If you have it, download it or something.
:) 

## Bob:
You need to play online because you need a program to play...
My client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe you can get it from me by FTP or HTTP.... wait...

## Alice:
How are you.
:) 
Go see
