<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "懵然不知". Format similar to example:

```
# 懵然不知
(pos:??)
<explanation>
yue:...
eng:...
<eg>
yue:...
eng:...
```

We need to decide part of speech. "懵然不知" is an idiom meaning "completely unaware; not knowing at all; clueless". It's a phrase, often used as adverbial phrase or predicate. Could be classified as "成語" (idiom) or "副詞短語". In Cantonese dictionary, maybe "成語" or "慣用語". Use pos:成語 (idiom) or "副詞". Let's follow example: they used (pos:名詞). For idiom, maybe (pos:成語). We'll write (pos:成語). Provide explanation in Cantonese: "形容對某件事完全唔知道，或者好驚訝咁唔明白". Provide English: "completely unaware; clueless; not knowing at all". Provide example sentences in Cantonese with romanization and English translation.

Example: "佢問我點解要加班，我懵然不知點回佢。" Or "我問佢點解會遲到，佢懵然不知點解。" Provide romanization: "keoi5 man6 ngo5 dim2 gaai2 jiu3 gaa1 baan1, ngo5 mong4 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 wui4 keoi5." Provide English: "He asked me why I had to work overtime, I was completely clueless about how to answer him."

Another example: "見到警察嚟，我懵然不知點樣走。" Provide romanization.

Make sure to use Cantonese grammar: "嘅" not "的". Use "係". Provide romanization with numbers.

Let's craft entry.

Also include note that "懵然" means "in a daze, bewildered". "不知" means "not know". Combined as idiom.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 懵然不知
