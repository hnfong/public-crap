<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "懵然不知". Format:

# 懵然不知
(pos:??) likely "成語" or "副詞"? It's an idiom meaning "completely unaware". So pos:成語 (idiom). Provide explanation in Cantonese. Provide English translation. Provide example sentences in Cantonese and English.

We must use Cantonese grammar, not Mandarin. Use "嘅" etc. Provide example sentences with Cantonese romanization (Jyutping). Use "yue:" and "eng:" lines.

Let's craft:

<explanation>
yue:形容對某件事完全唔知道，或者好驚訝到冇辦法即刻反應。 (量詞：無)
eng:describes being completely unaware of something, or being so stunned that one doesn't know what to do.

But need to follow format: <explanation> block includes both Cantonese and English? In example, they wrote:

<explanation>
yue:俾人#溜冰 嘅地方（量詞：個）
eng:ice skating rink

So we need similar: yue:... eng:...

Thus:

<explanation>
yue:形容對某件事完全唔知道，或者好驚訝到冇辦法即刻反應。（量詞：無）
eng:used to describe being completely unaware of something, or being so stunned that one cannot react immediately.

Now example:

<eg>
yue:佢問我點解要加班，我懵然不知點答好。 (keoi5 man6 ngo5 dim2 gaai2 jiu3 gaa1 baan1, ngo5 mung4 jin4 bat1 zi1 dim2 daap3 hou2.)
eng:I was at a loss for words when he asked me why I had to work overtime.

Another example maybe.

But we need only one example? In example they gave one sentence. So we can give one.

Make sure to use Cantonese romanization (Jyutping). Provide punctuation.

Thus final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|># 懵然不知
