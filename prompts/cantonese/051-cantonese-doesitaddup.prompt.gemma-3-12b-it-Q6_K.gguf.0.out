Okay, let's break down this comment and assess the likelihood of the story being true. Here's a detailed analysis, followed by my overall assessment:

**Translation of the Comment (for clarity):**

"I am a former colleague of this outstanding police cadet, Chen Da Wen, from a bank. I worked with him for a year at a British-owned bank. Why do I remember him so well? Because when he first joined, he shadowed me for a week. He was fired for damaging a vault's bottom. The boss said at the time that if he didn't leave immediately, they would report him to the authorities. As a result, after I came back from lunch, I went down with security to have him clean up and leave. Then he eventually went on to become a police officer. He has some character issues; I don't know how he passed the vetting process."

**Analysis of the Story's Elements & Credibility:**

Let's look at each part of the story and consider its plausibility:

*   **Former Colleague & Shadowing:** This is a believable starting point. New employees often shadow experienced ones for training. It's a common practice in banking.
*   **Damaging the Vault Bottom:** This is the core of the accusation. This is a *very* serious allegation. Vaults are incredibly secure, and damaging one would be a significant breach of security and potentially a criminal act.
    *   **Plausibility:** While *possible*, it's less likely. Vaults are typically very robust and not easily damaged accidentally. It suggests either gross negligence, deliberate malicious intent, or a very unusual accident.
*   **Boss Threatening to Report to Authorities:** This is consistent with the seriousness of the vault damage. Banks have a legal and regulatory obligation to report security breaches. The threat of reporting to the authorities is a reasonable response.
*   **Escorting Him Out & Departure:** The description of being escorted out by security is believable, given the circumstances.
*   **Transition to Police Academy:** This is the most surprising element. It's unusual for someone fired for a serious incident like this to then pursue a career in law enforcement.
*   **"Character Issues" & Vetting Concerns:** This is a vague but significant claim. The commenter suggests Chen Da Wen has underlying character flaws that should have been flagged during the police vetting process.
    *   **Vetting Process:** The Hong Kong Police Force (and most law enforcement agencies) have rigorous vetting processes. They involve background checks, interviews, psychological assessments, and often checks with previous employers.  It *is* surprising that someone with this alleged history would pass vetting, but not impossible (see "Possible Explanations" below).

**Do I Buy the Story?**

**I am inclined to believe *parts* of the story, but not necessarily the entire narrative as presented.** Here's why:

*   **The Core Allegation is Serious:** The vault damage is the key. It's a significant event that would likely leave a record. It's hard to imagine this happening and being completely erased.
*   **The Commenter's Motivation:** The commenter clearly has a grudge. This biases their account. They are likely exaggerating or selectively presenting information to damage Chen Da Wen's reputation.
*   **The Vetting Process is Robust:** While not foolproof, the vetting process is designed to uncover issues like this. It's unusual for such a serious incident to be missed.

**Possible Explanations & Nuances:**

*   **Exaggeration/Misinterpretation:** The commenter might be exaggerating the extent of the damage. Perhaps it wasn't a full "damage" but a minor incident that was blown out of proportion.
*   **Different Account of Events:** Chen Da Wen might have a different version of what happened. Perhaps he was wrongly accused, or the circumstances were more complex than the commenter portrays.
*   **Vetting Process Imperfections:** The vetting process isn't perfect. There could have been a gap in the information, or the interviewer might have been misled.  Previous employers are often contacted, but the information provided can be subjective.
*   **Time Passed:** The incident happened a year before they worked together. Records might have been lost or altered over time.
*   **The "Character Issues" are Unrelated:** The commenter's claim of "character issues" might be a separate matter, or it could be a vague attempt to discredit Chen Da Wen without providing specifics.

**Conclusion:**

The story raises serious questions. The vault damage allegation is the most concerning aspect. While I don't completely dismiss the possibility of the story being true, I believe it's likely biased and potentially exaggerated. It warrants further investigation, but should be treated with caution. It's important to remember that this is a single, potentially disgruntled, source.
