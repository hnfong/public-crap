<think>首先，用戶要求我用廣東話「銀包」一詞造10句廣東話例句，然後寫英文的翻譯。記住，要用廣東話語法，例如「的」寫成「嘅」，「是」寫成「係」。

「銀包」在廣東話中意思是「錢包」或「錢包」，指的是存放錢和卡片的錢包。

我需要造10句例句，每句都要包含「銀包」一詞。然後，為每句寫英文翻譯。英文翻譯應該準確，但不需要完全對應廣東話的語法，只需表達意思。

參照例子，例子是用「威水」一詞造句，然後寫英文翻譯。所以，我應該模仿這個格式。

格式應該是：

1. [廣東話例句] (英文翻譯)

2. ...

...

10. ...

完成10句例句。

現在，腦storm一些例句，用「銀包」一詞。例句應該自然，用廣東話語法。

1. 我個銀包唔見咗，好驚。 (I lost my wallet, I'm so scared.)

2. 佢個銀包入面有好多錢。 (There's a lot of money in his wallet.)

3. 我幫你執好個銀包。 (I帮你整理好你的錢包。)

4. 銀包係我嘅重要物品。 (The wallet is my important item.)

5. 我個銀包俾人偷咗。 (My wallet was stolen by someone.)

6. 佢個銀包好靚。 (His wallet is very beautiful.)

7. 我唔小心跌咗個銀包。 (I accidentally dropped my wallet.)

8. 銀包入面有我嘅身份證。 (There is my ID card in the wallet.)

9. 我去買個新銀包。 (I'm going to buy a new wallet.)

10. 銀包唔見咗，好唔方便。 (The wallet is lost, it's very inconvenient.)

這些例句都包含「銀包」，用廣東話語法。例如，「唔見咗」、「入面」、「好靚」等。

現在，寫英文翻譯。英文翻譯應該是意思表達，不需要嚴格對應廣東話的結構。例如，「我個銀包唔見咗」翻譯成 "I lost my wallet"，而不是 "My wallet is lost"。

確保每句都有英文翻譯。

最後，寫成一個列表，像例子一樣。

例子是：

# 詞: 威水

1. 佢咁細個就可以代表香港參加羽毛球比賽，認真威水。 (He represented Hong Kong in a badminton competition at a young age. He's such an outstanding person.)

2. ...

...

10. ...

所以，我應該寫：

# 詞: 銀包

1. [例句] (英文翻譯)

2. ...

...

10. ...

完成10句。

現在，整理我的例句，確保它們多樣化，不要重複。

1. 我個銀包唔見咗，好驚。 (I lost my wallet, I'm so scared.)

2. 佢個銀包入面有好多錢。 (There's a lot of money in his wallet.)

3. 我幫你執好個銀包。 (I helped you整理好 your wallet.)

4. 銀包係我嘅重要物品。 (The wallet is my important item.)

5. 我個銀包俾人偷咗。 (My wallet was stolen by someone.)

6. 佢個銀包好靚。 (His wallet is very beautiful.)

7. 我唔小心跌咗個銀包。 (I accidentally dropped my wallet.)

8. 銀包入面有我嘅身份證。 (There is my ID card in the wallet.)

9. 我去買個新銀包。 (I'm going to buy a new wallet.)

10. 銀包唔見咗，好唔方便。 (The wallet is lost, it's very inconvenient.)

這些例句都包含「銀包」，用廣東話語法。例如，「唔見咗」、「入面」、「跌咗」等。

英文翻譯應該是意思表達，例如：

1. I lost my wallet, I'm so scared.

2. There's a lot of money in his wallet.

3. I helped you整理好 your wallet. – 這裡「執好」意思是整理好，所以翻譯成 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 可能不準確。應該寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 或 "I整理好 your wallet for you"。但英文翻譯應該自然，所以寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 可能寫成 "I helped you整理好 your wallet"，但英文中 "整理好" 是 "整理好"，所以應該寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 或 "I整理好 your wallet for you"。為了自然，寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 可能不標準。應該寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 意思是 "I helped you整理好 your wallet"，但英文中 "整理好" 是 "整理好"，所以寫 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 可能寫成 "I helped you整理好 your wallet"。更好的英文是 "I helped you整理好 your wallet" 或 "I整理好 your wallet for you"。但英文翻譯應該是意思表達，所以寫 "I
