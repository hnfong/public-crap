The speaker is a seasoned worker who is observing the job-seeking struggles of young people. He notes that many of these young people are having difficulty finding employment, particularly jobs that offer cash wages. He questions why companies have to resort to offering cash wages to attract job seekers, suggesting that these young people may not have the necessary qualifications for such positions. He points out that many of these job seekers lack experience and education, and wonders why employers should hire them. He argues that with so many people in the job market, those with poor qualifications have no choice but to accept whatever work they can find. He concludes that the problem is not with the companies or the job offers, but with the job seekers themselves.

In terms of the speaker's conclusion, it is important to note that while some young people may lack experience and education, there are also systemic issues that contribute to their difficulties in finding employment. For example, the job market may be saturated with qualified candidates, making it difficult for less experienced individuals to compete. Additionally, some employers may have unrealistic expectations or biases against certain groups of job seekers. Therefore, while it is true that some job seekers may need to improve their qualifications, it is not fair to place all the blame on them for the difficulties they face in finding employment. 

As for the language used, the speaker uses colloquial Cantonese, which may be more relatable to some readers but may also limit the accessibility of his message to those who are not familiar with the dialect. 

Overall, the speaker's perspective is valid to some extent, but it is important to consider the broader context and systemic issues that contribute to the difficulties faced by young job seekers.
