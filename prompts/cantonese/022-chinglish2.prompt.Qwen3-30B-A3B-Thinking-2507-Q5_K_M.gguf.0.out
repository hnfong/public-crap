Okay, let's tackle this translation request. The user wants a conversation between Alice and Bob translated into simple English. First, I need to understand the original text, which seems to be a mix of English and some Chinese dialects or slang, maybe Singlish or Hokkien.

Looking at Alice's first message: "hah. yeh. me 2. I like to play very much gah. but never gamble lor :)" The "gah" and "lor" are probably Singlish particles. "Gah" might be like "ah" or "you know," and "lor" is a common Singlish ending. So translating that to simple English would be something like "Haha. Yeah, me too. I love playing a lot. But I never gamble, okay :)".

Next, Bob says: "orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-). except for that time a few weeks ago". "Big2" is a card game, so I should keep that as is. "Orr" might be a typo for "Oh" or "Or," so maybe "Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either either. Except for that time a few weeks ago."

Alice responds: "a few weeks ago joe mud ah?" "Joe mud" sounds like a mishearing or typo. Maybe "Joe" is a name, and "mud" could be "mud" as in the game, but more likely it's "Joe, mud ah?" which might be "Joe, what happened?" So translating to "A few weeks ago, Joe, what happened?"

Bob: "went to a friends house he wanted to play big2 wor gum i say play lor gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good) gum I fai si 'so hing' la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh..." Breaking this down: "Wor" is probably "want" or "wanna," "gum" is "and," "fai si" might be "say" or "said," "so hing" could be "so what" or "so much," "jeh" is Singlish for "okay" or "right." So translating: "I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2. I said, 'Let's play.' He said, '1 cent per card' (because he's really good). I said, 'So what?' Besides, I'd lose at most like $10, okay..."

Alice: "gum yau hai :) hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor" "Gum yau hai" might be "And you're right." "Lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai" is confusing. Maybe "lei gor" is "let's go," "yuun doe" could be "you don't," "gei moe" might be "get more," "sor wai" is "so why." So "And you're right. Haha. Let's go, you don't get more stress. It's good actually. But if you gamble too much, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, okay."

Bob: "but it's not very good to 'stand so hard' ga... yea if need to gamble it's very stressful... btw, do u have the program?" "Stand so hard" might be a mistranslation of "play too hard" or "be too serious." So "But it's not good to 'play too hard,' you know... Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful. By the way, do you have the program?"

Alice: "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth :)" "Meh" is "my," "moe" might be "more," "hai ng" is "have," so "My program. More, have you download or something :)" Translating to "My program. More, do you have to download it or something :)" Wait, maybe "Meh" is "My," "program" is the same. "Moe hai ng hai yiu download" could be "More, do you have to download it or something." So "My program. Do you need to download it or something :)".

Bob: "gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la... my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait..." "Gum" again is "and," "of coz" is "of course," "ga la" is Singlish for "okay." So "And to play online, of course you need a program to play, okay... My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait..."

Alice: "hoe ark. :) ng goi sai hehe" "Hoe ark" might be "How are you?" or "Hoe" as in "how," "ark" as "okay." "Ng goi sai" could be "Not going to say" or "Not sure." So "How's it going? :) Not sure, hehe."

Wait, "hoe ark" might be "How are you?" but in Singlish, "hoe" is "how," "ark" might be "okay" or "all right." So "How's it going? :)" "Ng goi sai" – "ng" is "not," "goi" might be "going," "sai" is "say," so "Not going to say, hehe." But maybe it's "Not sure, hehe." So "How's it going? :) Not sure, hehe."

Now, checking for consistency. Let's make sure the translation is simple English, avoiding Singlish terms. Replace "lor," "gah," "wah," etc., with standard English phrases. Also, "Big2" is a card game, so keep that as is.

Let me go through each line again:

Alice:
hah. yeh. me 2. I like to play very much gah. but never gamble lor :)

Haha. Yeah, me too. I love playing a lot. But I never gamble, okay :)

Bob:
orr... i never gamble on big2 either ;-)
except for that time a few weeks ago

Oh... I never gamble on Big2 either either. Except for that time a few weeks ago.

Alice:
a few weeks ago joe mud ah?

A few weeks ago, Joe, what happened?

Bob:
went to a friends house
he wanted to play big2 wor
gum i say play lor
gum he said 1 cent for a card... (coz he plays very good)
gum I fai si "so hing" la... besides, at most lose sth like $10 jeh...

I went to a friend's house. He wanted to play Big2. I said, "Let's play." He said, "1 cent per card" (because he's really good). I said, "So what?" Besides, I'd lose at most like $10, okay...

Alice:
gum yau hai
:)
hehe. lei gor yuun doe gei moe sor wai
it's good actually. but if ngor juun hai yiu gamble I would not enjoy the game thoroughly lor

And you're right. :) Haha. Let's go, you don't get more stress. It's good actually. But if you gamble too much, I wouldn't enjoy the game fully, okay.

Bob:
but it's not very good to "stand so hard" ga...
yea if need to gamble it's very stressful...
btw, do u have the program?

But it's not good to "play too hard," you know... Yeah, if you have to gamble, it's really stressful. By the way, do you have the program?

Alice:
meh program.
moe
hai ng hai yiu download or sth
:)

My program. More, do you have to download it or something? :)

Bob:
gum play online of coz need to have a program to play ga la...
my client doesn't support file transfers yet... maybe u can get it from me by ftp or http.... wait...

And to play online, of course you need a program to play, okay... My client doesn't support file transfers yet... Maybe you can get it from me via FTP or HTTP... Wait...

Alice:
hoe ark.
:)
ng goi sai
hehe

How's it going? :) Not sure, hehe.

Wait, "hoe ark" – "hoe" is "how," "ark" might be "okay," so "How's it going?" "Ng goi sai" – "ng" is "not," "goi" might be "going," "sai" is "say," so "Not going to say" but that doesn't make sense. Maybe "ng" is "no," "goi" is "go," "sai" is "say," so "No go say" which might be "Not going to say." But in context, maybe it's "Not sure." So "Not sure, hehe."

Double-checking "ng goi sai" – in Singlish, "ng" can be "not," "goi" might be "going," "sai" could be "say," so "Not going to say." But maybe it's a typo for "ng goi sai" as "not going to say," but in the context, Alice is saying she's not sure, so "Not sure, hehe."

Also, "meh program" – "meh" is "my," so "My program." Then "moe" might be "more," but "moe hai ng hai yiu download" – "moe" could be "more," "hai ng" is "have," "hai yiu" is "have you," "download or sth." So "My program. More, do you have to download it or something?"

Wait, "meh program. moe hai ng hai yiu download or sth" – "meh" = my, "program," "moe" = more, "hai ng" = have you, "hai yiu" = have
