Three hours ago, when I got home from work and went online, I saw people mourning the passing of #YuYingshi. At that time, I only knew that he was a professor #WangWeixiong's idol, and I knew nothing else about him.

However, in the 21st century, we don't need to ask teachers for information; we can know everything with Google. After searching for a while, I gradually understood why he was so famous and why Professor Wang mentioned him so often...

Professor Yu was a professor at three Ivy League schools! How impressive! Just the name alone is enough to scare people!

I kept digging into Yu Yingshi's background: how the Chinese Wikipedia writes about him, how the English Wikipedia writes about him, how people praised him when he won awards, and how today's obituaries describe him. In my mind, I saw a person I most respected... Teacher Yun Gen. It's quite similar!

Unfortunately, Teacher Yun didn't have a Harvard professorship, but the traditional Chinese skills of being well-versed in ancient and modern knowledge and identifying with China are definitely the same. Teacher Yun likes Daoism and Buddhism, while Professor Yu seems to be a fan of Confucianism.

But that's a problem.

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, as well as the order of seniority and the relationship between ruler and minister. But if you studied in the United States during the peak of the hippie era and got a PhD, would you really teach people to respect their teachers and not be so individualistic? That would be a contradiction.

Speaking of which, how scholars can avoid contradictions is a lesson that Confucius spent his entire life learning. Confucian students couldn't possibly not know this: In Confucius' time, when the world was in chaos, he traveled around the states, hoping to find a position and do something great. But he only knew how to recite the Book of Zhou and didn't know how to cater to his boss's needs, so he returned without success. However, failure is the mother of success, and his students made more progress. The Grand Historian said: "The seventy disciples of Confucius scattered and traveled among the states, the greater ones becoming teachers and officials, the smaller ones becoming friends and teachers of scholars." Why?

Because after several generations of inheritance, they began to understand their ruler's needs. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with the ruler were different; he could joke and talk, and understand his ruler: "King Qi, you even feel sorry for killing a cow, you must be a benevolent ruler! Follow the path of the king!"

By the end of the Warring States period, the "Confucian" strategists had mastered the game of "interviewing the ruler." In order to get a position, they abandoned "benevolence" and "propriety" and started studying the new technology of "rule of law." So, as a Confucian scholar, Xunzi's students could become high-ranking officials in the Qin Dynasty government. You can't smell a trace of Confucius on Li Si.

Today, with over a hundred countries in the United Nations, the situation is more complex than during the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian descendants left the ancient "land of rites" China and went to the barbaric military power of the United States. Would they really take out the Analects and call people to observe a three-year mourning period? Everyone knows how many closed doors Confucius and his students faced back then. So, in the United States, Confucius' disciples would say that Confucius supported democracy and that the Communist Party is a failure.

Some might ask: Does this have no consequences? Of course not! Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and the Confucian tradition was destroyed during the May Fourth Movement. As the authority of the top universities in the only superpower after World War II, you could say that Johnny Kung teaches people to use drugs and play with women, and some people might believe it. After all, the American "theoretical nuclear bomb" is solid, and the consequences of Japan not believing it are still fresh in everyone's memory.

So, why could Professor Yu casually translate some content from the Book of Han into English and get a PhD, and even be invited to teach at several universities? You know. Putting you on the altar as an authority is to make you boldly say: "Everyone here is a duck, do you think Confucius' thoughts are feudal? Oh, what a misunderstanding! He was actually a democratic fighter! You don't have a Harvard professorship, so listen to me!"

As for whether Confucian thought conflicts with democracy, to be honest, these things are not something that "Sinologists" know. You say the Republic of China is an example. Hey, is Taiwan's political system Confucian? The Nationalists are constantly cursing Tsai Ing-wen, is that how Confucians play? Does Tsai Ing-wen really perform the ritual of worshipping heaven and earth? No, right? The spirit of science, not being a shaman, goes against the Confucian principle. Do you think using Chinese characters is Confucian? Do you think Confucianism is only in China?

As I said earlier, Japan is Confucian, and the UK is Confucian (at least among advanced countries, they are the most like Confucianism): the ruler emphasizes etiquette and ceremony, power is given by heaven, supreme, and cannot be challenged, everyone is in layers of hierarchy, and there is no way to challenge the hierarchy, the society is stable. As for whether they succeed or fail in democracy, it's not something a Chinese-American has the right to comment on.

The main point the author is trying to convey is that Confucian scholars, like Yu Yingshi, often adapt their teachings to fit the context of the society they are in, rather than strictly adhering to the original principles of Confucianism. The author argues that this adaptation can lead to contradictions and that it is not appropriate for scholars to claim that Confucianism is compatible with modern democratic values. The author also criticizes the tendency of some scholars to present themselves as authorities on Confucianism while ignoring the original teachings of Confucius and instead promoting ideas that align with their own personal beliefs or the values of the society they are in. The author suggests that this kind of adaptation and reinterpretation of Confucianism can lead to a distortion of its original meaning and principles. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context in which Confucianism developed and the potential consequences of applying its teachings in a different context. The author's main point is that scholars should be more honest and transparent about their interpretations of Confucianism and the potential implications of their teachings. The author also suggests that Confucianism should be studied and understood in its original context, rather than being adapted to fit modern values or political ideologies. The author's main point is that scholars should be more critical and reflective in their approach to Confucianism and avoid presenting it as a universal or timeless philosophy that can be easily applied to any context.
