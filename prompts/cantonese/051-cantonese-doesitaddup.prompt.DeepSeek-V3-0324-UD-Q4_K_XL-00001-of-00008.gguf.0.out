This comment raises serious allegations about the award-winning officer, Chan Tai Man, claiming that he was fired from a previous job at a British bank for embezzlement ("穿櫃桶底") and questions how he passed the police vetting process. Here’s how to assess the credibility of the story:

### **1. Possible Reasons to Believe the Story:**
- **Specific Details:** The comment provides concrete details (e.g., shadowing for a week, being escorted out by security, the threat of police involvement), which suggest firsthand knowledge.
- **Motive for Speaking Out:** As a former colleague, the poster may have no reason to lie and could be genuinely concerned about Chan’s integrity.
- **Vetting Process Flaws:** While police vetting is rigorous, no system is perfect—past misconduct might have been missed if records were unclear or if Chan concealed it.

### **2. Reasons to Be Skeptical:**
- **Anonymous Forum Post:** Without verifiable proof (e.g., HR records, news reports), the claim is hearsay. The poster’s identity and motives are unconfirmed.
- **Lack of Context:** The story doesn’t explain how Chan could pass police background checks (which typically include employment history and criminal records). If the bank threatened to "報官," why was there no formal record?
- **Timing:** The post appears after Chan’s award, which could suggest sour grapes or a personal grudge.

### **3. Key Questions:**
- Was Chan’s dismissal documented? If the bank fired him for theft, it’s unlikely they wouldn’t report it to authorities or provide a reference.
- How did the police vetting process miss this? Hong Kong police vetting includes checks with previous employers and criminal records.
- Why is this only surfacing now? If true, why didn’t former colleagues or the bank raise concerns earlier?

### **Conclusion:**
The story is plausible but unverified. While the level of detail lends some credibility, the lack of evidence and the forum’s anonymity make it hard to accept at face value. If true, it would reflect poorly on both Chan and the police vetting system. However, without corroboration (e.g., bank records, official reports), it remains an allegation. 

**Would I "buy" it?** Not without further proof—but it’s serious enough to warrant scrutiny. If the claims are true, they should be investigated formally, not just debated online. [end of text]
