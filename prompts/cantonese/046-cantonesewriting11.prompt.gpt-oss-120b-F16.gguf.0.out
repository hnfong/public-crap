<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce entry for "副簽". Provide pos: noun? maybe verb? In Cantonese, "副簽" refers to "assistant signing" maybe "co-signer"? Actually "副簽" in Hong Kong context: "副簽" is a term for "assistant signatory" in a company, like a deputy signatory who can sign documents on behalf of the company. Also used in immigration: "副簽證"? Wait "副簽" maybe "副签" Chinese for "co-signer" or "secondary signature". In Hong Kong, "副簽" is a role in a company: "副簽" (fuk1 cim1) meaning "deputy signatory". So definition: person authorized to sign documents on behalf of a company, but not the main signatory. Also can be used for "assistant signatory" in banks.

Thus entry:

# 副簽
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:公司或機構入面，獲授權可以代替主要簽署人簽文件嘅人（量詞：個/位）

Add another example maybe.
