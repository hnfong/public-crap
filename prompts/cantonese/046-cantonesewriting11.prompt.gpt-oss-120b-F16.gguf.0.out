<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a dictionary entry for "副簽". Provide pos:名詞. Explanation in Cantonese, with English translation. Provide example sentence(s) in Cantonese with romanization and English translation.

We need to know meaning of "副簽". In Cantonese, "副簽" likely refers to "副签" in Mandarin, meaning "deputy signatory" or "assistant signature"? Actually "副签" could be "副签证" meaning "secondary visa"? But "副簽" maybe used in Hong Kong context: "副簽" as "副签" meaning "assistant signature" on documents, like "副签" meaning "co-signer"? Let's think.

Search memory: In Hong Kong, "副簽" (fuk1 cim1) used in context of "副簽證" (assistant visa) maybe not. Could be "副簽" meaning "副签" as "secondary signature" on a cheque? Actually "副签" in Chinese can mean "co-signer" (someone who signs as a guarantor). In Cantonese, "副簽" could be used for "co-signer" on a loan, like "副簽人". But the term "副簽" alone maybe used as noun meaning "co-signer" or "secondary signatory". Let's search memory: In Hong Kong, "副簽" is used in "副簽人" (fuk1 cim1 jan4) meaning "co-signer". So "副簽" could be short for "副簽人". So definition: "幫手簽字、作保證嘅人，通常係喺合約、支票、貸款等文件上簽名，作為主要簽署人嘅副手". So we can define as "喺文件上代替或陪同主要簽署人簽名嘅人".

Thus entry:

# 副簽
(pos:名詞)
<explanation>
yue:指喺合約、支票、貸款等文件上代替或陪同主要簽署人簽名，作為保證或協助嘅人（量詞：個/位）。
eng:co‑signatory; a person who signs a document together with or on behalf of the primary signatory, usually as a guarantor.

<eg>
yue:佢係我哋公司貸款嘅副簽，銀行要佢簽先批款。 (keoi5 si6 ngo5 dei6 gung1 si1 daai6 fun2 ge3 fu6 cim1, ngan4 hong4 jiu3 keoi5 cim1 sin1 paak3 fun2.)
eng:He is the co‑signatory for our company's loan; the bank requires his signature before approving the loan.

Add maybe another example.

But format: need <eg> block containing both Cantonese sentence and English translation. In example for "溜冰場", they used:

<eg>
yue:溜冰場有好多細蚊仔。 (lau4 bing1 coeng4 jau5 hou2 do1 sai3 man1 zai2.)
eng:There are many kids in the ice skating rink.

So we follow same.

Thus final answer:

```
