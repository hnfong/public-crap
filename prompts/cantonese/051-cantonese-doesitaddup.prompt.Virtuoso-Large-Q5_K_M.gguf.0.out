The story you've shared raises several red flags and inconsistencies that make it difficult to accept at face value, especially given the context of the person receiving an award for being an outstanding policeman. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Character and Background Check (Vetting):**
   - Police forces, especially in jurisdictions with high standards, conduct thorough background checks (vetting) on potential recruits. This includes financial history, employment history, and character references. If the story is true and the individual was fired for misconduct, it would likely have shown up during the vetting process, making it highly unlikely for him to be accepted into the police force, let alone receive an award for outstanding service.

2. **Employment Dispute:**
   - The story describes a dramatic and somewhat extreme reaction from the employer, including threats to report the individual to the police and having security escort him out. While such incidents can happen, they are relatively rare and would typically leave a significant paper trail, which would be discovered during a police background check.

3. **Character and Professionalism:**
   - The story paints a picture of the individual as someone with questionable character and professionalism. If this were true, it would be inconsistent with the qualities typically recognized in an award for outstanding service. Police forces value integrity, reliability, and a strong moral compass, and an individual with a history of serious misconduct would be unlikely to be considered for such an award.

4. **Motivation for the Story:**
   - Consider the motivation behind the story. Is the person telling it a former colleague with a grudge or a personal vendetta? Are there any biases or ulterior motives that could be influencing the narrative?

5. **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:**
   - The story is based on a single account and lacks any corroborating evidence. Without additional sources or documentation, it's difficult to verify the claims.

6. **Professional Conduct in the Police Force:**
   - If the individual has indeed received an award for outstanding service, it suggests that he has demonstrated exceptional performance and professionalism in his role as a police officer. This would be at odds with the negative portrayal in the story.

Given these points, it is prudent to approach the story with skepticism. While it is possible that the story contains some elements of truth, the significant discrepancies and the improbability of the individual passing a rigorous vetting process make it unlikely that the story is entirely accurate. It would be more reliable to seek additional information from official sources or individuals who have a more comprehensive and unbiased view of the person's background and performance.
