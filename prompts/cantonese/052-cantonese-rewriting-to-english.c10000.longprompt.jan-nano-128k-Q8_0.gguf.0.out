Okay, the user wants me to rewrite the given essay into English without translating individual words or phrases. Let me start by reading through the original text carefully to understand the context and the author's intent.

The essay is in Chinese and seems to discuss the popularity of Yu Ying-shi, a scholar, and his connection to the Chinese academic community, particularly in the US. The author mentions that Yu is a favorite of Professor Wang Weixiong, and they explore his background, noting that Yu was a professor at Ivy League schools. The author then compares Yu to the traditional Chinese scholar, like Guan Tong, who was a Confucian scholar but didn't have a Harvard position. The essay also touches on the contrast between Confucianism and Western democratic values, suggesting that Confucianism is more about hierarchy and tradition, while Western academia might have different priorities.

Now, the user wants the essay rewritten in English, but without translating individual words or phrases. That means I need to keep the original structure and expressions, just converting them into English. For example, "三小時前放工返屋企上網" becomes "Three hours ago, after returning from work to my home, I went online..." I need to make sure that the names and terms like #余英時, #王偉雄, #博古通今, #我即華夏 are kept as they are, possibly with explanations if needed, but the user didn't ask for that. So I'll just keep the hashtags as they are.

Next, the user wants a comment on the essay, disregarding the sarcastic tone. The main point is likely about the adaptation of Confucianism in Western academia versus its traditional Chinese context. The author is pointing out that while Confucian scholars like Yu Ying-shi are respected in the US, their traditional values might not align with Western democratic ideals. The author also mentions that Confucianism's emphasis on hierarchy and tradition might not be compatible with modern democratic systems, which value individualism and equality. The comparison to Guan Tong and the example of the US academic system versus traditional Chinese society is key here.

I need to make sure the comment is clear and focuses on the main argument without getting bogged down by the sarcastic elements. The author is highlighting the tension between Confucian traditions and Western academic norms, suggesting that Confucian scholars in the US might be more successful by adapting their teachings to fit Western contexts, even if it's a departure from their original principles. The main point is that Confucianism, when applied in Western settings, can be reinterpreted to align with democratic values, but this might not be the case in traditional Chinese society where Confucianism is more about hierarchy and social order.

Three hours ago, after returning from work to my home, I went online and saw someone mourning #Yu Ying-shi. At that time, I only knew he was a favorite of Professor #Wang Weixiong, but I had no idea about his life story. However, in the 21st century, you don't need to ask #teachers; with Google, you can know everything. After checking, I gradually understood why he is so famous and why Professor Wang is so enthusiastic about mentioning the old man.  

Yu Ying-shi has been a professor at three Ivy League universities! Wow, really? Just the mention of his name is enough to scare people!  

I felt like a stalker, constantly digging into Yu Ying-shi's background: how does the Chinese Wikipedia describe him? How does the English Wikipedia describe him? What did people say about him when he won awards? How do today's obituaries portray him? In my mind, I saw the most respected person of all, Mr. Yun Gen. It's really similar!  

Unfortunately, Mr. Yun Gen doesn't have a Harvard professorship, but his #博古通今, #我即華夏 traditional Chinese scholarship is definitely on the same path. Mr. Yun Gen loves Daoism and Buddhism, while Yu Ying-shi seems to be a Confucian fan.  

But that's tragic.  

Confucianism emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness; it also stresses hierarchy and respect for authority. However, if you study at the top university in the US during the peak of the counterculture era, earn a PhD, and then return, you might not truly understand how to teach others to #尊師重道, or avoid #individualism. That would be a disaster.  

So, how do scholars avoid being a disaster? It's the hard-earned wisdom of Confucius, who spent his whole life struggling to find a way to apply his teachings. Confucian disciples couldn't possibly be ignorant of this: during Confucius's time, the world was about to fall into chaos, and he traveled across countries, hoping to find a position to do something meaningful. But he only knew to memorize the rites of Zhou Gong, not to cater to the needs of the people, and ultimately failed. However, failure is the mother of success, and his disciples advanced much more. The "Records of the Grand Historian" says: "The disciples of Confucius scattered among the feudal lords, some becoming advisors and ministers, others just friends of scholars." Why?  

Because after several generations of transmission, they began to understand the subtle nuances of the monarch's expressions. By the time of Mencius, his interactions with the king were more nuanced—there was conversation, laughter, and he could read the king's intentions. For example, Mencius told the King of Qi, "I see you don't want to kill a cow, so you must be a benevolent king!" He advocated the Way of the King, and the king listened.  

By the end of the Warring States period, the "Confucian" advisors had mastered the art of "royal interviews." To become officials, they abandoned "benevolence" and "propriety," instead studying "rule of law" as a new technology. Thus, Xunzi, a Confucian disciple, could produce students who became high-ranking officials in the Qin Dynasty, like Li Si. You can't even smell the scent of Confucius in Li Si.  

Today, the United Nations has over 200 countries, and the situation is more complex than in the Spring and Autumn period. Confucian scholars, who once left China (the ancient "land of propriety") to go to the wild, militaristic US, can't really take out a copy of the "Analects" and tell people to #守孝三年. Back then, Confucius even had to serve a "closed door" meal to his students, a story everyone knows. So, in the US, Confucian disciples might say, "Confucius supports democracy, and democracy is great! The Communist Party is a disaster, so you can have Ivy League professors!"  

Someone might ask: "Why is there no consequence for this?" There isn't. Confucius and Mencius died over two thousand years ago, and the Confucian tradition was smashed during the May Fourth Movement. As the top academic authority of the only superpower after WWII, you can't say that a US-based Chinese scholar teaching drug use and dating is wrong, because the US's #theoretical nuclear bomb is solid. The Japanese, who don't believe in superstition, have seen the consequences firsthand.  

So why could Yu Ying-shi, by just quoting a few sentences from the "Book of Han" and translating them into English, get a PhD and be invited to teach at several universities? #You know. They put him on the altar of authority, hoping he would say: "All of you are ducks, you think Confucius's ideas are feudal? Oh, that's a big misunderstanding! Actually, he was a democrat! If you don't have a Harvard professorship, just listen to the lecture!"  

As I mentioned earlier, Japan is Confucian, and the UK is Confucian (at least for advanced countries, the UK is the most Confucian). The king emphasizes etiquette and ceremony, power is granted by heaven, supreme and unchallengeable. Everyone is in a hierarchy, no one dares to challenge the hierarchy, so society is stable. However, the success or failure of their democratic systems is not something a US-based Chinese person is qualified to comment on.

**Comment:**  
Disregarding the sarcastic tone, the author's main point is to argue that Confucianism, when adapted to Western academic contexts, can be reinterpreted to align with democratic values, even if this diverges from its traditional Chinese roots. The essay contrasts the Confucian emphasis on hierarchy, tradition, and social order with the Western focus on individualism and democracy, suggesting that Confucian scholars in the US (like Yu Ying-shi) may prioritize fitting into Western systems over preserving their original philosophical principles. The author also critiques the idea that Confucianism is inherently incompatible with democracy, using examples like Japan and the UK to show that Confucian values can coexist with modern democratic structures, but ultimately questions the legitimacy of Western academics in judging the merits of Confucianism in non-Chinese contexts.
