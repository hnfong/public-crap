Here’s a simple English translation of the conversation:

---

**Alice:**  
Haha. Yeah, me too.  
I really like to play a lot.  
But I never gamble, okay? :)  

**Bob:**  
Oh… I never gamble on Big Two either. ;)  
Except that one time a few weeks ago.

**Alice:**  
A few weeks ago, was it at Joe Mud’s place?

**Bob:**  
We went to a friend’s house.  
He wanted to play Big Two.  
I said let’s play.  
But he said each card would cost 1 cent… (because he’s really good at it)  
So I thought, “That’s too expensive,” besides, at most I’d lose around $10, right…

**Alice:**  
Yeah, that’s true. :)  
Hehe. If you’re not careful, you might lose even more.  
Actually, it’s kind of fun.  
But if you really have to gamble, I wouldn’t enjoy the game as much.

**Bob:**  
But it’s not good to get too serious about it.  
Yeah, if you have to gamble, it’s really stressful…  
By the way, do you have the program?

**Alice:**  
What program?  
I don’t have it.  
Do you have it and can send it to me or something? :)

**Bob:**  
Of course, to play online you need a program to play with.  
But my client doesn’t let me send files yet… Maybe you can get it from me using FTP or HTTP… wait…

**Alice:**  
Oh, okay. :)  
Thanks.  
Hehe
