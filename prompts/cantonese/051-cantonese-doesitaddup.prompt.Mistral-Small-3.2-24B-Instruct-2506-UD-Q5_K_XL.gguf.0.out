The story told by the commenter is quite detailed and specific, which can make it seem credible at first glance. However, there are several reasons to approach this story with skepticism:

1. **Lack of Verification**: The commenter does not provide any verifiable evidence to support their claims. There are no names of the bank, specific dates, or other details that could be checked independently.

2. **Anonymity**: The commenter is posting anonymously, which makes it difficult to assess their credibility or motives. They could have personal reasons for wanting to discredit the award-winning policeman.

3. **Unusual Behavior**: The story describes the policeman being asked to leave the bank because of his choice of clothing, which is an unusual reason for termination. Most professional environments have dress codes, but it's rare for someone to be fired immediately for violating them, especially without prior warnings.

4. **Legal Implications**: The commenter mentions that the bank threatened to report the policeman to the authorities if he didn't leave immediately. This is a serious allegation, and one would expect such an incident to have legal repercussions or at least be documented somewhere.

5. **Vetting Process**: The commenter questions how the policeman passed the vetting process to become a police officer. However, vetting processes can be complex and may not catch every issue, especially if the issues are not well-documented or if the individual has changed their behavior.

6. **Motivation**: The commenter's motivation for sharing this story is unclear. Are they trying to warn others, or do they have a personal grudge against the policeman?

In conclusion, while the story is detailed, it lacks verifiable evidence and has several unusual elements that raise doubts about its credibility. It's important to approach such stories with caution and consider the possibility of bias or misinformation. [end of text]
