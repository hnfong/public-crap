Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order, so that larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements in the input list. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(0, len(arr)-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Merge Sort:

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by dividing the input list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element. Then it merges these sublists back together in sorted order. The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in both the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements in the input list. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    return result + left[i:] + right[j:]
```

Comparison:

- Bubble sort is an in-place algorithm that requires only O(1) extra space to store swapped elements, while merge sort requires O(n) extra space to store the sorted sublists. Therefore, bubble sort has a lower space complexity than merge sort.
- Bubble sort works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This can lead to many unnecessary comparisons if the input list is already mostly sorted. Merge sort avoids this problem by dividing the input into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element, and then merging these sublists back together in sorted order. Therefore, merge sort has a lower time complexity than bubble sort in both the worst and average cases.
- Bubble sort is an easy to understand algorithm that can be implemented with simple loops and comparisons. Merge sort is more complex and requires recursion and auxiliary functions to implement the divide and conquer strategy. Therefore, bubble sort may be easier to code and debug for beginners. However, merge sort may be more efficient for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.
