<|im_start|>user
What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
output

The above Python code will result in an infinite loop because the variable "x" is always less than infinity (math.inf). Therefore, the program will never reach the print statement to output a value for x. The program will run indefinitely until it's terminated by the user or system.
