I sit in my class, try to pay attention to the teacher, but my mind keep wander. I think about the forest, the trees, the feel of the sun on my skin. My friends, they all seem so normal, so human. But me, I am different. I am not like them.

I am a wood elf, or at least, I am half. My mother, she is a wood elf, she is from the forest, and my father, he is human. He did not know about my mother's true nature, and she did not know that he would not be able to accept her. So, they kept it a secret, and I grew up with a mix of two worlds.

Now, I am a teenager, and I have to deal with my own secret. I have to keep it hidden from my friends, from my family. It is hard, but I have to. If they know, they will not understand. They will think I am weird, that I am not like them.

But it is hard, especially when I am in the forest, when I can be myself. I can run and play, and feel the sun on my skin. I can talk to the trees, and they can talk back to me. It is the only place where I can be free.

But when I am not in the forest, I have to be careful. I have to be careful not to reveal my true nature. I have to be careful not to make any mistakes. I have to be careful not to be seen.

It is hard, but I am determined. I am determined to keep my secret safe, to keep my true nature hidden. I am determined to be myself, even if it means being different.

And so, I continue to live my life, to attend school, to make friends, all while keeping my secret safe. It is a difficult life, but it is the only life I know.<|eot_id|>
