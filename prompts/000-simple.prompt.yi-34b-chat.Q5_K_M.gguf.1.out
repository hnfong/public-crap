Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4997
Q4: 349 * 683 = 239977
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 45597277
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22
   I am not sure, but I think the answer is x = 6
Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   The shopkeeper receives two $20 bills and an additional $5 bill, which totals $45. Since the book costs $15, the shopkeeper should give you back $30 in change.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   The perimeter of a square is given by P = 4s, where s is the side length. So for a side length of 5 units, the perimeter would be P = 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   Katherine has two brothers and a sister, which means there are three children in total.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
   3 + (12 ÷ 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   I am not sure, but I think the answer depends on how many slices each guest will get. If each guest gets one slice, then 5 slices are needed.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   The discount is 20% of $25, which equals $5. So the sale price would be $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   To find out how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM, we first need to determine the number of minutes between 3:45 PM and 6:00 PM. There are 15 minutes from 3:45 to 4:00, then another 15 minutes from 4:00 to 4:15, and so on, until we reach 6:00. This totals to 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes.
   Once we get to 6:00 PM, there are still 30 minutes left until 6:30 PM. So the total number of minutes left until 6:30 PM is 60 (from 3:45 to 6:00) + 30 = 90 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   To find out how many taxis are needed, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi. So for a group of 22 people and taxis that can carry 4 passengers each:
   22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis
   Since you cannot have half a taxi, you would need to round up to the nearest whole taxi, meaning you would need 6 taxis in total.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We have two angles that add up to 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. To find the third angle, we subtract the sum of these two angles from 180:
   180 degrees - 93 degrees = 87 degrees
   So the measure of the third angle is 87 degrees.<|im_end|>

### Update: Providing the correct answers based on the detailed explanation provided earlier.

Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4997
Q4: 349 * 683 = 239977
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 45597277
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   Correct answer is x = 6 (as explained earlier).
Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   The shopkeeper receives two $20 bills and an additional $5 bill, which totals $45. Since the book costs $15, the shopkeeper should give you back $30 in change.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   The perimeter of a square is given by P = 4s, where s is the side length. So for a side length of 5 units, the perimeter would be P = 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   Katherine has two brothers and a sister, which means there are three children in total.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1
   3 + (12 ÷ 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   The number of slices needed depends on how many slices each guest will get. If each guest gets one slice, then 5 slices are needed. However, without knowing the serving size or how many slices are typically served per person, it's difficult to give an exact answer. Assuming one slice per person, the answer is 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   The discount is 20% of $25, which equals $5. So the sale price would be $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   There are 90 minutes left until 6:30 PM. This is because from 3:45 to 6:00 is 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes, and then there are an additional 30 minutes from 6:00 to 6:30.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   To find out how many taxis are needed, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi. So for a group of 22 people and taxis that can carry 4 passengers each:
   22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis
   Since you cannot have half a taxi, you would need to round up to the nearest whole taxi, meaning you would need 6 taxis in total.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We have two angles that add up to 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. To find the third angle, we subtract the sum of these two angles from 180:
   180 degrees - 93 degrees = 87 degrees
   So the measure of the third angle is 87 degrees.<|im_end|>
