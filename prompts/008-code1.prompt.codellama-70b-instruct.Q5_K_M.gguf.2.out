  Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

 This is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it relatively slow for large datasets, but it is easy to implement and can be used as a reference point when comparing other sorting algorithms.
