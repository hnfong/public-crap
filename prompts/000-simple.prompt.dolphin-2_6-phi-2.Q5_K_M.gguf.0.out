Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4917
Q4: 349 * 683 = 243727
Q5: 64243 * 7489 = 449695963
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 => 3x = 15 => x = 5
Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: The book costs $15, and I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills. So she gives me back $5 as change. In addition to this, I give her a five-dollar bill, which makes the final change 5 + 5 = 10 dollars.
Q9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length, so for a square with a side length of 5 units, the perimeter would be 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister, making a total of five children in her family.
Q11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Since each guest needs one slice of cake and there are 5 guests, they need a total of 5 * 1 = 5 slices of birthday cake.
Q13: The sale price is calculated by subtracting the discount from the original price, so for an $25 shirt on 20% off, the sale price would be 25 - (0.20 * 25) = 25 - 5 = $20
Q14: The current time is 3:45 PM, and we need to find the difference until 6:30 PM. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 6:30 PM is 1 hour and 30 minutes later. So, there are (60 + 30) = 90 minutes left. In addition to this, there are 45 minutes from 3:45 PM, making the total time left as (90 + 45) = 135 minutes or 2 hours and 15 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers, so for a group of 22 people, we need (22 รท 4) = 5.5 taxis. Since we cannot have half a taxi, we would need 6 taxis to transport all the 22 people.
Q16: The sum of the given angles is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. In a triangle, the sum of all three angles must be 180 degrees. So, the measure of the third angle is (180 - 93) = 87 degrees.
