Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4897
Q4: 349*683=239067
Q5: 6043*7489=45173627
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. I am not sure, but I think the answer is x=5 (by subtracting 7 from both sides and then dividing by 3)
Q7: What is 25% of 80? The answer is 20 (since it is a percentage problem, you have to multiply 80 by 25/100 which equals 20)
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The answer is $13 (because you paid $45 in total and the book costs only $15)
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The answer is 20 (since all sides are equal in a square, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4)
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? The answer is 4 (Katherine herself plus her two brothers and one sister equals four children)
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. The answer is 4 (because first you divide, then you add or subtract from left to right)
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? I am not sure, but I think the answer depends on how much cake each person gets (it could be as little as one slice per person if there are leftovers or as many as five slices if there are different flavors for each guest)
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The answer is $20 (because it's like asking "If I sell this for 80 cents of its original value, how much will I get")
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? I am not sure, but I think the answer is 97.5 (since there are 2 and a half hours from 3:45 to 6:30)
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? The answer is 6 (because you need at least 6 taxis, with each carrying 4 passengers, to transport all the people in the group)
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The answer is 87 degrees (because the sum of the three angles in any triangle must equal 180 degrees, so if we know that two angles add up to 93 degrees, then the remaining angle must be 180 - 93 = 87)
