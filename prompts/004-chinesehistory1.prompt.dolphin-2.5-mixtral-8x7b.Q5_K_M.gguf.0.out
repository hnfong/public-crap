 秦始皇 Qin Shi Huang, 也 извест为秦王子幷, 是中国史上的第一 emperor. He was born to the family of the King of Qin, Ying Zheng and his wife, Queen Xia. Qin Shi Huang's childhood was not particularly happy or carefree, as he faced many challenges and struggles in his early life.

As a prince, Qin Shi Huang was under constant pressure to prove himself worthy of the throne. His father, King Zhaoxiang, had a reputation for being harsh and demanding, which likely influenced Qin Shi Huang's upbringing. In addition to this stress, the young prince also faced a series of assassination attempts by his enemies and even members of his own family.

Despite these difficulties, Qin Shi Huang eventually succeeded in unifying China under his rule and establishing the first imperial dynasty known as the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). His reign marked the beginning of a long period of centralized political control over China that would last for more than two thousand years.
