The National People's Congress, or NPC, is like a big group of people who come together in China to make important decisions and rules for the country. They are like the leaders who help guide the country and make sure everything runs smoothly. Just like how your parents make rules for you at home, the NPC makes rules for everyone in China to follow. They also meet once a year to talk about important things and make sure that everyone is working together and doing their best to make China a great place to live.<|im_end|>
