Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". For example:

1. Enter a number: `0.1`
This input will increment x by 0.1 each time in the while loop until it exceeds math.inf (infinity). The program will then print "Done".

2. Enter a number: `-0.1`
Similarly, this input will decrement x by -0.1 each time in the while loop until it reaches or goes below math.inf (infinity). The program will then print "Done".
