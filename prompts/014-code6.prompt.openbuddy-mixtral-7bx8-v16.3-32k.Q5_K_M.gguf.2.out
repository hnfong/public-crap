Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

No, this program does not contain any condition or loop that would make it reach a point where it prints "Done" and stops execution. It will continue to run indefinitely as long as `math.inf` is used for the comparison in the while loop, since `x + inc` can never be equal to `math.inf`.
