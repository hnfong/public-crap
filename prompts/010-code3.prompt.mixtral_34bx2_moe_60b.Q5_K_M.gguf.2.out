Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The intended purpose of this Python code is to implement an efficient algorithm for sorting an array using selection sort and then splitting it into two sorted arrays: one containing elements less than or equal to a pivot element, and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. The function takes in an array `a` as input and returns the split array with the pivot element in its correct position.

Now let's review the code:

1. **Mistakes:** 
There don't seem to be any obvious mistakes in this code.

2. **Coding Style:** 
The coding style is quite readable and follows Python conventions. However, I would suggest a small change to make it more idiomatic and easier to read: using list comprehension with `if` condition instead of multiple list comprehensions for better performance.

3. **Efficiency:** 
This code uses selection sort, which has an average-case time complexity of O(n^2). However, since the main purpose of this function is not sorting but rather splitting an array into two parts based on a pivot element, we can assume that the input is already sorted and thus improve its efficiency to O(n).

4. **Implementation Details:** 
The code does not check for any special cases such as empty arrays or arrays with only one element. It may be beneficial to add these checks for better robustness.

Here's a revised version of the function in Rust:
```rust
fn s(a: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut len = a.len();
    if len <= 1 { return a.to_vec() }; // Handle empty arrays and arrays with one element
    let p = a[0];
    let (l, r) = a.split_at_mut(len - 1); // Split the array into left and right parts
    l.sort_unstable();                   // Sort the left part
    r.sort_unstable();                  // Sort the right part in reverse order
    let mut res = vec![];
    res.extend(&l[..=0]); // Add the pivot element to the result vector
    res.extend(&*r);      // Extend the result vector with the sorted elements from the right part
    return res;
}
```
This Rust code follows idiomatic style and improves efficiency by splitting the array into two parts, sorting each separately, then adding the pivot element in its correct position and finally joining the sorted arrays. It also handles special cases such as empty arrays or arrays with one element.
