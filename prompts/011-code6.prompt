Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.
#! Something huge like 1E303 so that it would overflow normal floats easily. Also input with "inf" would make it happen as well.
