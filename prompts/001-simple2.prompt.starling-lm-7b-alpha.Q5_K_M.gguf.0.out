Q1: The significance of the number 120:
- It is the product of two consecutive positive integers: 120 = 8*15.
- It is the sum of the first four consecutive even integers: 120 = 2+4+6+8.
- It is the square of a positive integer: 120 = 10*10.
- It is the product of three consecutive positive integers: 120 = 2*3*5.
- It is the sum of two consecutive integers and their product: 120 = 10*11 + 10 + 11.

Some interesting properties of 120:
- The number 120 has 16 divisors.
- The number 120 is a Harshad number in all bases from 2 through 9, and a Harshad number in base 10 modulo 13.
- The number 120 is a centered octagonal number, decagonal number, dodecagonal number, and an Icosian number.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it as (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0. So the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. To calculate the number of round trips it can make within a full day, we need to find the time it takes to travel one round trip and divide it by 24 hours in a day. 

The time taken for a one-way trip is distance/speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.333 hours (approximately). So, for one round trip, it would take 2 * 3.333 hours = 6.666 hours (approximately). Dividing this by 24 hours in a day gives us 6.666 / 24 = 0.278 days (approximately). Since we need whole trips, we can round up to 1 whole trip and say that the train can make 1 full round trip within a day. 

However, if we want to maximize the number of round trips, we can try to minimize the time spent at the station. In practice, it's unlikely that the train would spend zero time at the station, but if we consider a very short time at the station, say 0.1 hours, then the total time for one round trip becomes 3.333 + 0.1 = 3.433 hours. Dividing by 24 hours in a day gives us 3.433 / 24 = 0.143 days (approximately), which rounds up to 1 whole trip with a short station stop. 

Therefore, under the assumption of negligible time spent in the cities, the train can make between 1 and 2 full round trips between the two cities within a full day, depending on the time spent at the station.

I am not sure if this fully answers your question, as the details regarding the "short time" at the station and the assumption of negligible station time might not be realistic in practical scenarios.

Here are some additional facts about the number 120:
- It is a centred triangular number and a centred quadrangular number. 
- It is the sum of the first nine consecutive odd integers: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17. 
- It is the sum of the first seven consecutive odd squares: 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + 13^2. 

As for solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, one common approach is factoring. In this case, the factors (x - 9) and (x + 2) can be found by trial and error or by using the quadratic formula. 

To find the number of round trips the train can make, we can calculate the time it takes for a one-way trip and divide it by the speed of the train. Then, we can divide the total time available in a day (24 hours) by the total time for one round trip to find the maximum number of round trips. 

The assumption that the time spent in the cities is negligible is a simplification that allows us to ignore the time spent at the station. In practical scenarios, this might not be a realistic assumption, but it helps to provide an upper bound on the number of round trips. 

I apologize if my previous response did not fully address your question, but I hope this one provides more clarity.

As for the additional facts about the number 120:
- It is a centred triangular number, meaning that if you remove the central square of a grid of 120 squares, the remaining squares form an equilateral triangle. 
- It is a centred quadrangular number, meaning that if you remove the central square and the four squares around it from a grid of 120 squares, the remaining squares form a rhombus. 
- It is the sum of the first nine consecutive odd integers: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17. This can be shown by observing that each even integer between 2 and 18 is the sum of two consecutive odd integers. 
- It is the sum of the first seven consecutive odd squares: 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + 13^2. This can be shown by observing that each even square between 4 and 125 is the sum of two consecutive odd squares.

As for solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0:
- Factoring is a common approach, but it requires finding two numbers that multiply to give -18 and add up to give -7. These two numbers are 9 and -2, as 9 times -2 equals -18 and 9 plus -2 equals -7. 
- The quadratic formula, while more complex, provides a general method for solving any quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. It states that x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where sqrt denotes the square root. In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18, so the solutions are x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1) = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2, which simplifies to x = (7 ± sqrt(121)) / 2 = (7 ± 11) / 2. This gives us the solutions x = 9 and x = -2, which agree with our earlier result from factoring.

To find the number of round trips the train can make between two cities, we can calculate the time it takes for a one-way trip and divide it by the speed of the train. Then, we can divide the total time available in a day (24 hours) by the total time for one round trip to find the maximum number of round trips. However, in practical scenarios, the assumption that the time spent in the cities is negligible might not be realistic. But if we make this assumption, it allows us to ignore the time spent at the station and provides an upper bound on the number of round trips.

The quadratic formula is another method for solving this equation. It states that x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation. In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18, so the solutions are x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1) = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2 = (7 ± 11) / 2. This gives us the solutions x = 9 and x = -2.
