<s> USER: Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the writing style which is strongly connected to a particular day and month. Explain your rationale. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

ASSISTANT: 1. The passage mentions "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature," which suggests that the text was written after the C++20 standard was released or at least after modules were widely recognized as a feature coming in C++20. C++20 was officially adopted by the ISO C++ committee in February 2020, so the text would likely have been written after this date.

2. The author refers to "C++26" and the features expected in that standard, implying that the text was written at a time when C++26 was already being discussed and planned. This would place the text after the release of C++20, as the C++ community would typically focus on the next standard after the current one is finalized.

3. The author mentions "Herb Sutter cppfront," which is a reference to a proposal for a new C++ front-end that was first announced by Herb Sutter in a blog post on September 23, 2019. However, the mention of "potentially a new syntax" suggests that the text was written after this proposal had time to be known and discussed within the C++ community.

4. The passage discusses the "rapid adoption of new features" in C++, with new versions every 3 years. This aligns with the C++ standardization process, which aims to release a new standard approximately every three years (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and so on).

5. The author's mention of "stackful coroutines" as a feature to look forward to in C++26 suggests familiarity with the ongoing discussions and proposals for that standard. This level of detail implies that the text was written after these discussions had become public and were being followed by the C++ community.

6. The reference to the "C++ compatible Carbon language" suggests that the text was written after Carbon was announced. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Carbon is a language that was proposed by Google as an alternative to C++, with the goal of maintaining interoperability with C++ codebases. The first public mention of Carbon was around mid-2022.

7. The author's critique of the Rust community and its policies promoting diversity, as well as the desire to focus strictly on technology, could reflect broader discussions happening in the software development community around that time. This sentiment could be indicative of a period when such debates were particularly prominent.

8. The mention of "the edition mechanism" in Rust refers to a feature introduced in Rust 2018, which allows for non-breaking language changes. This indicates that the author is aware of the Rust 2018 edition and possibly the Rust 2021 edition, which was stabilized in October 2021.

Given these points, the text was likely written after the release of C++20 in February 2020, after the public discussion of C++26 features, after the announcement of Carbon in mid-2022, and possibly after the stabilization of Rust 2021 in October 2021. Therefore, a plausible date range for the writing of this passage would be late 2021 to mid-2023.

However, the hint provided suggests looking at a specific day and month. Given that the text includes forward-looking statements about C++26 (which, as of 2023, is still in the proposal stage) and mentions specific upcoming features, it's possible that the passage was written around the time of a major C++ conference or event where such features were being discussed.

One such event is the CppCon conference, which is held annually in September or October. If the author is influenced by discussions at such an event, it's conceivable that the passage could have been written shortly after CppCon in the fall of 2022 or 2023.

Considering all the evidence, a speculative guess would be that the passage was written in the fall of 2022 or 2023, potentially around the time of CppCon, which would align with the author's forward-looking statements about C++ and the critique of the Rust community's approach to diversity and language evolution.</s>
