The Qianlong Dynasty, which ruled China from 1735 to 1796, is known for several notable figures. Among them, the Qianlong Emperor's childhood companions and influential family members had a significant impact on his life and reign. Their presence during his formative years left an indelible mark on him as well.

The Qianlong Emperor's mother, Noble Consort Duan, played a crucial role in nurturing his early development. She was highly respected for her intellectual abilities, and her guidance helped shape the emperor's character. Her influence extended beyond the royal household; she contributed to the education of numerous scholars and writers, fostering an environment conducive to learning within the palace walls.

The Qianlong Emperor also had several influential relatives during his childhood. Among these were his grandfather, Qing Dynasty founder Emperor Shunzhi, his great-grandfather, Emperor Yongzheng, and his great-uncle, Prince Rui. These men were not only close family members but also held significant power in the imperial court. They provided guidance to the young emperor as well as shaped the political landscape during their reigns, which indirectly influenced Qianlong's future policies and actions.

In addition to his immediate relatives, the Qianlong Emperor had a wide circle of friends who played an essential role in his childhood. Among them were Li Yingyu, a scholar, and Wen Tianxiang, a talented musician. These friends not only entertained the young emperor but also exposed him to various cultural practices, including traditional arts and music. Their influence on the emperor's worldview would undoubtedly have long-lasting effects on his reign.

Furthermore, the Qianlong Emperor had several mentors during his formative years. His most significant mentor was his personal physician, who not only cared for the emperor's physical well-being but also provided guidance on various matters, including etiquette and governance. The emperor often sought advice from this wise individual, which demonstrates the young ruler's open-mindedness and willingness to learn from others.

In conclusion, the Qianlong Emperor's childhood was shaped by an array of influential figures, including his mother, grandparents, great-grandparents, relatives, friends, and mentors. Their presence during his formative years had a profound impact on the emperor's character, worldview, and future reign as Emperor Qianlong.
