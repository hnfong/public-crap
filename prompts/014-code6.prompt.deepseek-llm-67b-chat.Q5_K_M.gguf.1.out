Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs which would cause this program to print "Done". Any positive number entered for `inc` will eventually make `x` greater than or equal to infinity and the loop will terminate. 

Here's an example:
1. If you input a very small value like `0.00000001`, it would still work, although due to the limit of floating point representation in Python (or any programming language), it might take quite some time before x reaches infinity. 
2. You could also input larger values for inc such as `1` or `10`. These inputs will cause the program to print "Done" after a relatively shorter duration compared to smaller numbers.
