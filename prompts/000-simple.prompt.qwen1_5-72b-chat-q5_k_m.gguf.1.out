A1: 1+1=2
A2: 6*7=42
A3: 83*59=5017
A4: 349*683=237167
A5: 6043*7489=4,530,487
A6: Solving the equation 3x + 7 = 22 gives x = (22 - 7) / 3 = 5.
A7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20.
A8: The final change should be $20 for two 20 dollar bills minus the $15 cost of the book and the additional $5 given, so it's $20 + $15 - $5 = $30.
A9: The perimeter of a square with side length 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
A10: Katherine's mother has 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) + 1 (Katherine) = 4 children.
A11: The expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 evaluates to 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
A12: For 5 guests, they would need 5 slices of birthday cake.
A13: If the shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, the sale price is $25 - (20/100) * $25 = $20.
A14: There are 6:30 PM - 3:45 PM = 2 hours 45 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
A15: For a group of 22 people, you would need 22 / 4 taxis = 5.5, which rounds up to 6 taxis.
A16: The third angle in a triangle with two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees is 180 - (31 + 62) = 87 degrees.
