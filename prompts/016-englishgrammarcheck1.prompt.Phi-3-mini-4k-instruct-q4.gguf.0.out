So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Tense and Agreement Issues:

1. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" - "an" should be "a" to maintain agreement in number.

2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" - "he's" should be "it's" since the subject is implied to be the broader capitalist perspective.

3. "when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people" - "laidoff" should be "lay off" to match the present tense.
 Author's point of view:

1. "I'd have hated how I participated" - The use of "I" could be seen as inconsistent with the objective analysis in the rest of the text.

2. "the capitalist attitude" - It would be clearer to specify what aspect of the capitalist attitude is being referred to.

3. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make" - The use of "approximately" seems out of place here, as it's about a specific personal financial situation rather than an approximation.

4. "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack" - The phrase "some funny stack" could be more clearly explained to avoid potential confusion.

5. "just unique circumstances" - The sentence could be rephrased for better clarity.


Stylistic Issues:

1. Repetitive use of "I" - Overuse of the first person can detract from the overall objectivity of the analysis.

2. Lack of transition between ideas - The text jumps from one point to another without smooth transitions.

3. Mixed tenses - The text occasionally mixes past and present tenses, which can confuse the reader.

4. Incomplete sentences - Phrases like "but ideological concerns aside" could be expanded to form complete sentences.

5. Overuse of contractions ("I can't," "I'd") - Excessive use of contractions may affect the tone and formality.


Other Problems:

1. Lack of evidence or examples - Some statements, like the impact of regulations, could benefit from specific examples or data.

2. Overuse of industry jargon - Terms like "monopolies," "GOOG," and "META" may not be clear to all readers.

3. Redundant information - The mention of interest rates and monetary policy could be streamlined to focus on the main argument.

4. Sensitivity issues - The text may unintentionally come across as insensitive to the challenges faced by tech workers.

5. Implicit bias - The author's perspective might inadvertently reflect a bias, which could influence the reader's perception.<|end|>
