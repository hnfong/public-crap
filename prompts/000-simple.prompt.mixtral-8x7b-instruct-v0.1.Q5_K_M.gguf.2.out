 [/INST] Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4877
Q4: 349*683=238407
Q5: 6043*7489=451812307
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, first subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide by 3: x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20.
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you $5 in change since you gave her a $20 bill and two $20 bills, totaling $60, and you bought an item that cost $15.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children (2 brothers and a sister).
Q11: To evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1, first divide 12 by 4 to get 3. Then add 3 and subtract 1: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: Each guest needs one slice of birthday cake, so 5 slices are needed for the 5 guests.
Q13: To find the sale price, first calculate 20% of $25 by multiplying by 0.2 to get $5. Then subtract this amount from the original price: $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: There are 145 minutes left until 6:30 PM (from 3:45 PM, that is 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is equal to 3*60 + 45 = 210 + 45 = 255 minutes).
Q15: Since a taxi can carry 4 passengers, 6 taxis are needed for a group of 22 people (5 taxis would not be enough as they could only carry 20 people).
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle measures 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
