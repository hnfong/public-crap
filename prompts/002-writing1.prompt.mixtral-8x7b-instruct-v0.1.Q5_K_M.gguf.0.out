 [/INST] Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river, lived a young boy named Max. Max was known for his vivid imagination and his kind heart. He had a special pillow that he called his "cloud pillow," because it was as soft and fluffy as a cloud.

One day, Max's best friend, Lily, moved away to a big city far, far away. Max was devastated and felt like a piece of him was missing. He would lie on his cloud pillow every night, staring up at the ceiling and imagining that he could see Lily's face in the patterns of the plaster.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, Max began to exaggerate how much he missed Lily. He told anyone who would listen about how he couldn't live without her, and how he would never be happy again.

But then one day, something amazing happened. Max received a letter from Lily, filled with stories of her new adventures in the city. She wrote about the tall buildings that seemed to touch the sky, the bustling streets full of people from all over the world, and the delicious food that she had tried.

Max couldn't believe it. He realized that he had been so focused on his own sadness, that he had forgotten about Lily and all the amazing things she was experiencing. From that moment on, Max made a conscious effort to appreciate the people in his life, instead of taking them for granted.

He also discovered that love wasn't just about being with someone all the time, but rather, it was about cherishing the moments you have together and carrying those memories with you always.

And so, every night, Max would hug his cloud pillow tight and think of Lily, feeling grateful for her presence in his life, even if they were far apart. He learned that love is a powerful force that can connect us, no matter how far away we may be.
