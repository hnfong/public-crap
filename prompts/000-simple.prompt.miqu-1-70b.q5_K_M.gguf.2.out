### Response:

A1: The answer is 2.

A2: The answer is 42.

A3: The answer is 4917.

A4: The answer is 236587.

A5: The answer is 45038247.

A6: Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22, first subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide both sides by 3 to find that x = 5.

A7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 \* 80 = 20.

A8: The final change the shopkeeper should give me is $40 - ($15 + $20 + $5) = $10.

A9: The perimeter of a square with side length 5 units is 4 \* 5 = 20 units.

A10: Katherine's mother has 3 children (two brothers and a sister).

A11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

A12: Tom needs 5 slices of birthday cake for his guests.

A13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, the sale price is $25 - (0.2 \* $25) = $20.

A14: There are 165 minutes left until 6:30 PM if it's currently 3:45 PM.

A15: For a group of 22 people, you need 6 taxis (because each taxi can carry 4 passengers and 22 divided by 4 is 5 with 2 remaining). Since each taxi can hold 4 passengers, 5 taxis can only accommodate 20 people. Thus, a sixth taxi is needed to transport the last 2 individuals.

A16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, then the third angle measures 180 - (31 + 62) = 87 degrees because the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
