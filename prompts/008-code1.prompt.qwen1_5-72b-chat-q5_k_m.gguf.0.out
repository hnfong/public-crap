Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. It is based on the idea that merging two sorted arrays is easy and efficient.

Here's a Python implementation of merge sort:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            merged.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    merged.extend(left[i:])
    merged.extend(right[j:])
    return merged
```

Discussion and Comparison:
1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Bubble Sort: Worst case (already sorted in reverse order) is O(n^2), while the best case (already sorted) is O(n).
   - Merge Sort: Always has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both the worst and best cases.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - Bubble Sort: Space complexity is O(1) as it only requires a few additional variables.
   - Merge Sort: Space complexity is O(n) as it requires an additional array for merging the sorted halves.

3. **Stability:**
   - Bubble Sort: It is a stable sort, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative order.
   - Merge Sort: It is also a stable sort.

4. **Ease of Implementation:**
   - Bubble Sort: It's easy to understand and implement but not efficient.
   - Merge Sort: It's more complex to implement but is more efficient and suitable for large data sets.

5. **Performance:**
   - Bubble Sort: Not suitable for large data sets due to its quadratic time complexity.
   - Merge Sort: More efficient, particularly for large data sets, making it a preferred choice in practice.
