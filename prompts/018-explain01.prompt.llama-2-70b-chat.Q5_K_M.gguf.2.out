Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
 [/INST]  Yo, listen up; let me share a tale,
About a powerful entity, don't fail,
It's the Fed, yeah, the Federal Reserve,
Ain't no joke; they got the juice, you better serve.

They control the cash, the money flow,
Interest rates, they let it grow,
Banks, they regulate them too,
Don't want no shady things to do.

The economy, they got a grip,
Inflation, they keep it in check,rip,
They got the power, ain't no mistake,
When it comes to money, they don't play.

They got the president's ear,
They advise and make things clear,
Congress too, they got their back,
When it comes to stacks, they pack a smack.

So don't get it twisted; the Fed's the man,
Money matters? They got a plan, van,
Stability, that's what they seek,
Financial world? They keep it sleek.

Now you know, yo, the Fed's the name,
Don't get caught up in their game, fame,
Cause when it comes to cash, they got the clue,
Federal Reserve, they got it true.
