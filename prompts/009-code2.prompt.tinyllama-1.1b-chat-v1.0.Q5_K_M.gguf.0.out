Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

A binary search on a file using O(log(n)) operations can be performed using the following steps:

1. Open the file for reading in binary mode.
2. Create a list to store the indices of the sorted elements in the file.
3. Initialize the search position to the first element in the file and the insertion point to the first element in the list.
4. While the search position is less than the insertion point, keep performing the following steps:
   a. If the current element is greater than the target, swap the current element with the next element.
   b. Move to the next element in the list.
   c. Update the search position to the next element in the list.
   d. Update the insertion point to the next element in the list.
5. If the target is found in the file, return the position of the target. If it is not found, return the insertion point.

To perform a binary search on a file, we can use the following function:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
        buffer = bytearray()
        while True:
            buffer.extend(file.read(1024))
            if target in buffer:
                return int.from_bytes(buffer, "little")
        return -1
```

This function takes a file path, a target, and returns the index of the target in the file. The binary search uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to perform the search. The `bytearray` module is used to handle binary data in the buffer.

Here's an example usage:

```python
import binary_search_file

file_path = "filename.txt"
target = 5
search_result = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
if search_result > -1:
    print(f"{target} found at index {search_result}")
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in file")
```

In this example, the function takes the file path and target as input. The function opens the file in binary mode and iterates over each byte in the buffer until it finds a byte that matches the target. The binary search then returns the index of the found byte. If the target is found, the function prints the index where the target was found. If the target is not found, the function prints a message indicating that it was not found in the file.
