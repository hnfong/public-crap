"The best king of China is Emperor Qin Shi Huang."

The Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang is widely regarded as the best king of China due to his unification of China's various kingdoms under one rule in the 3rd century BCE. His empire was vast, and he accomplished many important reforms such as the establishment of a unified government, the building of a grand wall around the capital city, and the construction of a grand tomb for himself. Qin Shi Huang's reign brought stability to China and paved the way for its economic and military growth.</s>
