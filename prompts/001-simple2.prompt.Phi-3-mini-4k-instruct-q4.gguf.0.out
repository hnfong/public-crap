**Q1: Significance of the number 120 and its interesting properties**


The number 120 is significant in various contexts and has some interesting properties:


1. **Fractional Representation**: 120 is the product of 2^3 × 3 × 5. This prime factorization contributes to its significance as a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.


2. **Mathematics**: It is the product of the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7) which makes it a highly composite number. It is also considered a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3).


3. **History**: In the Babylonian number system, 120 was considered a very important number and was often used to denote a year in the calendar.


4. **Music**: The octave is divided into 120 parts in some music theory contexts. This division is known as the "120th subdivision" or "120-fold division of the octave," providing a finer scale for musical tuning.


5. **Astronomy**: There are 120 visible stars in the constellation Orion's belt, which is significant in many cultures and mythologies.


**Q2: Solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**


To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor the equation:


1. Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. These numbers are -9 and +2.


2. Factor the equation: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.


3. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:


   a. x - 9 = 0, so x = 9.

   b. x + 2 = 0, so x = -2.


Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.


**Q3: Round trips between two cities within a full day**


To calculate the number of round trips the train can make between the two cities within a full day, follow these steps:


1. Calculate the one-way travel time: 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours.


2. Calculate the round-trip travel time: 3.33 hours × 2 = 6.66 hours.


3. Assuming a full day is 24 hours, divide the total day by the round-trip time to find the number of trips: 24 hours / 6.66 hours ≈ 3.60.


Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it can make 3 full round trips within a full day.
