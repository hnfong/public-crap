Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, the program can produce outputs like "Done" if you enter very large numbers, for instance, `x = 10**60` or `x = 10^18`. In these cases, the output will be very large and not representable as a floating-point number.

However, this behavior can be mitigated by using the scientific notation for large numbers (e.g., `x = 10**60` or `x = 10^18`). This allows the program to handle arbitrarily large inputs without overflowing, and thus it should work as intended when inputs are of a reasonable size.<|im_end|>
