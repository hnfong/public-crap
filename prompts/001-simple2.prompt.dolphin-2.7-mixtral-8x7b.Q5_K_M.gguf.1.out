 I'm not sure about the significance of the number 120, but I think there might be some interesting properties related to its multiples or factors.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / (2(1))

x = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2

x = (7 ± sqrt(121)) / 2

x = (7 ± 11) / 2

The two possible solutions are:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the two solutions for x in this quadratic equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart, we can find the time it takes to travel between the two cities by dividing the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate how many round trips the train can make within a full day. A full day has 24 hours, so we need to find out if 24 is greater than or equal to 2 * number of round trips * time taken for each trip:

24 = 2 * number of round trips * (10/3)

To solve this equation for the number of round trips, we can rearrange it as follows:

number of round trips = 24 / (2 * (10/3))

number of round trips = 24 / (20/3)

number of round trips = 24 * (3/20)

number of round trips = 36 / 20

number of round trips = 1.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, the train can make 1 round trip within a full day.
