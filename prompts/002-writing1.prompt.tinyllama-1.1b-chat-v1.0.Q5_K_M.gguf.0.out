Sitting on her bed, the soft, white blanket comforting her with its warmth, Lily stared at the ceiling, her eyes scanning the clouds. She had always known that love was a strong emotion, but now it felt like an understatement. As she watched the clouds drift by, their shapes changing with every passing moment, she realized that love wasn't just something she could observe, but something she felt deep inside herself.
The softness of the pillow on her neck, its warmth in the cold night air, was like a comforting hug. It was a familiar sensation, one she had grown used to after living with her parents for years. They were her pillow and her cloud, her love and her exaggerating. But now, she knew that this feeling wasn't just something between two people, it was something she could give herself.
She took the pillow in her hands, resting her head on its soft surface. Her eyes closed, and with a gentle breath, she let go of everything else that disturbed her. The clouds were no longer there, but she felt an overwhelming sense of calm wash over her. It was a feeling so pure it was almost shocking, yet inexplicably comforting all at once.
Lily closed her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling the warmth from the pillow envelop her soul. She had always been cautious about expressing her feelings to others, fearful of being rejected or misunderstood. But now that she had found this sense of peace within herself, she felt as if she could speak her heart out without fear.
The next day, Lily spent a few hours in the park, sitting on a bench and watching the world go by. The gentle breeze played with her hair, while the rustling leaves filled the air around her. She felt a sense of peace that she had never known before, and it was a sensation she knew she could carry with her forevermore.
As the day wore on, Lily realized that love wasn't just about two people. It wasn't about the pillow or the cloud - it was about finding that place within oneself that allowed for an exaggerating feeling of peace, a feeling that could be shared with anyone. This sense of comfort she had found was something she would treasure forevermore, and she knew that her love for someone else would only grow stronger as she learned to express herself more fully.
