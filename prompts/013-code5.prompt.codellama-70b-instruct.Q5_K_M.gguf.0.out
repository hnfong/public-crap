  What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
  Source: assistant

 The Python program will run forever because it enters an infinite loop. The variable x is initialized to 1.0, and the while loop continues as long as x is less than infinity. Inside the loop, the value of x is multiplied by 1.001, so it increases in size with each iteration. However, due to floating-point precision limitations, at a certain point the increment will be too small for Python to detect, and x will stop increasing. In this case, the while loop will continue forever without ever reaching infinity. Source: assistant

 from decimal import Decimal
import math
x = Decimal('1.0')
while x < Decimal(repr(math.inf)):
    x *= Decimal('1.001')
