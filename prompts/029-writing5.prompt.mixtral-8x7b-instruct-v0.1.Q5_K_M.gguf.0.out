Write an story about the school life of a teenage student who is secretly a wood elf.
 [/INST] As I walked through the halls of my high school in Hong Kong, I couldn't help but feel out of place. Sure, I looked like any other teenager, with my uniform and backpack, but on the inside, I was so much more. You see, I'm not just a regular human teenager - I'm actually a wood elf, hiding in plain sight.

I was born in the heart of a vast forest, the only child of two powerful elven leaders. My life was filled with magic and wonder, but when our home was threatened by dark forces, my parents made the difficult decision to send me away to the human world for safety.

I was raised by a kind human family who taught me their ways and helped me blend in. But as I grew older, I began to feel the call of my true heritage. I started to practice my elven magic in secret, and I would often escape to the nearby parks and gardens to reconnect with nature.

School life was tough for me. I had to work twice as hard to keep up with my human classmates, especially when it came to learning English. My native language was Elvish, after all. But I was determined to succeed and make my parents proud.

Despite the challenges, I found joy in the little things. I loved spending time in the school's small garden during breaks, tending to the plants and talking to the animals. I also enjoyed learning about history and literature, especially the tales of heroes and legends.

As I entered my teenage years, I began to feel the weight of my secret. I longed to tell my friends about my true identity, but I knew I couldn't. I was afraid they would reject me or worse, turn me over to the authorities.

But then, something amazing happened. I met another elf, a fellow student who was also hiding in plain sight. We became fast friends, and I finally had someone to share my secrets with. Together, we explored the city's hidden green spaces and practiced our magic in secret.

With my newfound friend by my side, I felt more confident and less alone. I realized that being a wood elf in the human world wasn't such a bad thing after all. In fact, it made me unique and special.

And so, I continued to navigate the challenges of high school life, drawing strength from my elven heritage and the support of my new friend. I knew that my journey was far from over, but I was ready for whatever came next.</s>
