Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. Q1: The significance of the number 120 is that it is a perfect square, which means that it can be written as 120 = 1 x 120.

2. Q2: The equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be solved by setting x = 2 and solving the quadratic equation 2x - 7 = 0. This gives x = 2 and y = 3. So, x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 gives y^2 - 18y - 36 = 0, and y = (18) / 36 = 4.

3. Q3: The number of round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day is the number of days in the week (7 days) and the number of hours in the day (24 hours). So, 24 hours x 7 days = 144 hours, and 144 hours divided by 24 hours = 6. The total number of round trips is 6.</s>
