Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up fam, let me break it down for you
The Fed ain't nothin' but a bank, just like any other one too
But they got some special powers that make 'em stand out
They control the money supply, so they keep our economy from falling flat
See, when times are tough and folks need help
The Fed can lower interest rates to give 'em a yelp
And when things are lookin' good and inflation's risin'
They raise those rates to keep us from trippin'
Now some people think the Fed is just for Wall Street
But they got rules in place to protect regular folks too, you feel me?
So don't sleep on the Federal Reserve, it ain't nothin' but a game of checks and balances
They make sure our money keeps flowing, so we can all keep rappin' like savages!
