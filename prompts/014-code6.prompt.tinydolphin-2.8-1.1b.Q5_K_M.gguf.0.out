Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done".

Example 1:
Given `x = 0.0`, `inc = float(input("Enter a number"))`
If you enter 1.0, you get 1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0 which is greater than the maximum integer value (2^31 - 1 = 2^64 - 1 = 922,473,685,467,243), so `x` will be `2`.

Example 2:
Given `x = 0.0`, `inc = float(input("Enter a number"))`
If you enter -1.0, you get -1.0 + 1.0 = 1.0 which is greater than the maximum integer value (2^31 - 1 = 2^64 - 1 = 922,473,685,467,243), so `x` will be `-1`.

So yes, there are inputs that lead to the output "Done".<|im_end|>
