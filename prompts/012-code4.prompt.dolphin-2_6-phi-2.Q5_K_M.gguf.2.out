What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The Python program will print out "Infinity" (float('inf')). The reason for this is that in the while loop condition, it's set to be less than math.inf (infinite), which means the loop would continue forever if not terminated by some other conditions or logic. But in this particular case, no break statement or additional condition has been provided so it continues until x becomes infinity.
