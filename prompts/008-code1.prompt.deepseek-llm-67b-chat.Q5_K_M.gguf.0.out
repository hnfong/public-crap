Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort Implementation:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Merge Sort Implementation:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    # Finding the middle point to divide the array into two halves
    middle = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:middle]
    right_half = arr[middle:]
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)
    return list(merge(left_half, right_half))

def merge(left_half, right_half):
    merged = []
    left_index = 0
    right_index = 0
    while left_index < len(left_half) and right_index < len(right_half):
        if left_half[left_index] < right_half[right_index]:
            merged.append(left_half[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right_half[right_index])
            right_index += 1
    merged.extend(left_half[left_index:])
    merged.extend(right_half[right_index:])
    return merged
```

Comparison:

1. Time Complexity: The time complexity of the Bubble Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average case and O(n) in the best case. The time complexity of the Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all 3 cases (worst, average, and best).

2. Space Complexity: The space complexity of the Bubble Sort is O(1). The space complexity of the Merge Sort is O(n).

3. Stability: Bubble Sort is a stable sort algorithm. It maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. Merge Sort is also stable.

4. In-Place Sort: Bubble Sort is an in-place sort algorithm, meaning it doesn't require any additional space. On the other hand, Merge Sort is not an in-place sort algorithm because it requires extra space.

5. Use Case: Bubble Sort is best for small lists and lists that are almost sorted. Merge Sort is better for large lists and is often used for sorting linked lists and external sorting (sorting data that does not fit into main memory).

In conclusion, although Bubble Sort is simpler and faster for small lists, Merge Sort is more efficient for larger lists and is generally preferred due to its O(n log n) time complexity.
