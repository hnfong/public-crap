Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here are Python implementations of both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:
```python
# Implementation of Bubble Sort in Python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Last i elements are already sorted, so we only need to look at the first (n-i)-elements
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if current element is greater than next
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

And here's the implementation of Merge Sort:
```python
# Implementation of Merge Sort in Python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        # Finding the mid of the array
        mid = len(arr)//2
        
        # Dividing the array elements into two halves
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]
        
        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)
  
        i = j = k = 0
          
        # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
          
        # Checking if any element was left
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
  
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```
Bubble Sort: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. It's not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are of Ο(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted.

Merge Sort: Merge sort, on the other hand, uses a 'divide and conquer' strategy to gain efficiency. The array is divided into equal halves until we have arrays with single elements (which are considered 'sorted'), then those sub-arrays are merged back together in a manner that results in a complete sorted array. It has an average and worst case time complexity of Ο(n log n), which makes it more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger datasets.

In conclusion, while Bubble Sort is simpler to understand and implement, Merge Sort provides better performance on large data sets due to its superior time complexity.
