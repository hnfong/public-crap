So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Please review this text and point out any grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. Do not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category.

ASSISTANT: 1. Grammar/Tense Issues:
   - "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The tense here shifts from present to past and back. It should be consistent. Consider revising to "So, there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz suggesting that people in big tech companies may not be doing enough real work to justify their existence."
   - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - "I'm sure" should be "I'm sure we all are".
   - "back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." - This sentence should start with a capital letter since it's a new sentence. "In particular META and GOOG" is a bit awkward; consider rephrasing to "In particular, I considered whether it would be wise to buy shares of META and GOOG, which were then at lower prices."
   - "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - "I had no ounce of doubt" is an idiomatic expression; it should be "I had no doubt" or "I was certain". Also, "without really affecting day to day operations" is subjective and could be rephrased for clarity.
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - "McKinsey Pichai" seems to be a mix-up of Sundar Pichai and McKinsey & Company. Clarify who you're referring to.
   - "But ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - This sentence should start with a capital letter.
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - This sentence is a bit colloquial and informal for the context. Consider revising to "In America, where capitalism is deeply ingrained, there is a general sentiment that the tech giants are too valuable to be subjected to antitrust legislation."
   - "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." - "REALLY" is in all caps, which should generally be avoided in formal writing unless it's for emphasis in a specific context.
   - "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)," - "these jobs are going to be as great/shitty" is informal and could be rephrased to maintain a professional tone, e.g., "these positions will likely fluctuate in quality, aligning with the general volatility of the job market."

2. Stylistic Issues:
   - The text is quite lengthy and contains multiple ideas within a single paragraph, which can be overwhelming for the reader. Consider breaking it into shorter, more focused paragraphs.
   - The use of slang and colloquialisms ("golden goose", "gig in the general job market", "predatory capitalist attitude") may not be suitable for all audiences and could be replaced with more formal language.
   - The text switches between personal reflection and broader analysis, which can be jarring. Try to maintain a consistent tone and perspective.
   - The author's voice is somewhat confrontational and personal, which may not be appropriate for all contexts. Consider toning down the personal opinions to maintain objectivity.
   - The text contains several run-on sentences and could benefit from more punctuation to break up ideas and improve readability.

3. Other Issues:
   - The text could be improved by integrating direct quotes or specific examples to support the author's claims, particularly when discussing the impact of layoffs or the potential failure of tech companies.
   - The author's financial strategy is mentioned, which is fine, but the text could be more clear about the rationale behind the decisions made.
   - The reference to "levels.fyi" is specific and may not be understood by all readers. It could be helpful to explain what it is or provide context.
   - The text could use more transitions between ideas to guide the reader through the argument more smoothly.
   - The author's technical expertise being "in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" is a bit of an oxymoron; it could be more accurately stated to reflect the reality that some technologies, although less common, are still valid and useful in specific contexts.</s>
