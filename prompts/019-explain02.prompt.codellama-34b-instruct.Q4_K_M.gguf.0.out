Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.


### Response:

The National People Congress is like a big club that all Chinese people join when they are born. It's a way for everyone in China to have a say in what their country should do. Whenever there's something important to decide, the members of the NPC get together and talk about it. They vote on things like laws, taxes, and foreign policy so that everyone can be on the same page.
