What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The output will be extremely large, but not infinite because Python has a maximum limit for float numbers that can be represented. The loop will keep multiplying 'x' by 1.001 until it reaches the maximum possible float value in Python.
