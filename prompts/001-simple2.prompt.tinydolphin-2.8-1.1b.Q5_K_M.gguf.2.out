Give the answer for all these questions. Provide steps. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..."

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 Sure! Here's the answer to all three questions:

Q1: The significance of the number 120 lies primarily in its prime factorization. Prime factors are numbers that divide another number without leaving any other factors. In this case, 120 is a prime number (it has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 3, b = -7 and c = 18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = ((-7) ± √((-7)² - 4(3)(18))) / 2(3)

x = (-7 + √((-7)^2 - 16)) / 2(3)

x = (-7 + 5√10) / 2(3)

x = (-7 + 25) / 4(3)

x = (-7 + 75) / 12

x = (52) / 6

So, 120 rounds trip travel between the two cities within a full day. The time taken is negligible compared to the distance.<|im_end|>
