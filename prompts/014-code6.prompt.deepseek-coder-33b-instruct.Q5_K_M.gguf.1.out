### Instruction:

Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

The condition `x < math.inf` in this program is always true since the value of 'inf' (infinity) in Python is greater than every other number including x. Hence, the loop will never end and "Done" will not be printed to the output. 

Thus, no inputs will lead to the output "Done".

As a note, if we were to run this program with an input of zero (0), it would result in an infinite loop because x would always remain equal to zero and incrementing by zero would never reach infinity. So, any non-zero number is an acceptable input that will lead to the "Done" output.
