 I had always been a happy child, but my parents were so busy that it felt like we hardly ever got together. One day, when I was seven years old, they decided to move far away from where we lived, into a new city. It was an adventure for us all, and I knew it would change our lives forever.

As the days went by, we didn't see each other much. My parents worked long hours in their new jobs, and my grandma had her health to care for. The distance between us felt like a gaping chasm that could never be bridged. I missed them so much, but there was no way I was going back to the old life.

Then, one day, I found out that my mommy had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She didn't have any symptoms, just a small lump in her breast and some pain. The doctors said it was very serious, but she refused treatment, saying it wasn't necessary. It felt like the weight of the world was lifted off me, as I could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

My grandma had passed away a few months before my mommy's diagnosis, and now, with cancer, she was taking care of my mommy too. I loved spending time with her, helping her with things around the house or just listening to her stories. It wasn't easy, but it felt like a way to make her feel less alone.

In the middle of all this, my dad started talking about having some funeral arrangements made. He suggested that we hold a memorial service for everyone who had been there for us during our childhood. I remember feeling a mix of sadness and excitement about it. It was going to be a moment where we could come together as a family and say goodbye to the past, but also make room for the new life we were about to start.

The day arrived, and I felt like the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders. A whole village came together, with people bringing food, flowers, and love. They sat on the grass outside our house and listened to stories, shared laughter, and said their goodbyes. It was a beautiful day, one that will forever be etched in my memory.

As night fell, we lay down in the garden behind our house, with candles in each hand. I had taken the decision to not have any flowers, as I didn't want to make it difficult for my mommy to remember the days she had spent without her dearest love. Instead, I shared a story about the life we were about to start together and how grateful I was for the love we would share in our new journey.

When the night came to an end, all that remained were memories of that beautiful day, of laughter and love, and the promise of a brighter future. And so, my mommy's battle with cancer had come to an end, and life was going to change for the better. We would take care of each other, love one another, and make sure our family thrived as much as it could.

And that is how I remember the loss in life and grieving.<|im_end|>
