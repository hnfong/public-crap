# 大澳蝦膏

蝦膏 comes in a dry block. One convenient way to use it is to cut out a piece
and fry it in oil. Then it can be used similar to the more common 蝦醬 (but
tastes less salty). The unused parts can be frozen in freezer for home cooks
who don't use it too often.

# 豆瓣醬

After reviewing a couple HK brands, I came to the shocking conclusion that most
豆瓣醬 sold in Hong Kong aren't made (primarily) of 蠶豆.....

The taste of fermented 蠶豆 is actually quite distinct from the usual soybean.
It's more pungent, and usually requires some light frying in oil to temper the
flavor. It also makes that oil red.
