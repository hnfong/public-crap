# Reviews

I realized I need to write reviews of things I've used as a record, not
necessarily to share the information with others, but to serve as a record and
a reminder to my future self.

This is especially true for things that I have incidentally discovered, and
then due to my forgetfulness, gets thrown out of my conscious mind a short
while later.

That said, I'll also put reviews here for things that I've used for a lifetime.
