# AI Image Generation

## FLUX

- schnell (on mflux)
  - Currently (mid 2025) my go-to image generation model/program. Fast and useful.

- black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev
  - Tested with mflux. Surprised that it works out of the box, kudos to Krea for distilling into the flux architecture.
  - Claims to be photo realistic.
  - Not bad, but wasn't very spectacular. Eg. when I asked it to generate a generic photo of a chair, it can have deformed limbs; You can still tell the output is obviously AI generated if you look closely
