  - I’m looking at Cambria Tail Risk ETF (TAIL) Stock Price, Quote, History & News - Yahoo Finance. and similar instruments that are available to all. Check out the 5-yr chart. It clearly shows protection during the Dec 2018 mini-crash too. Also, see Tail Risk Hedge Funds | FactorResearch The huge returns of Universa are a misinterpretation of leaked company data, i.e., clickbait. They’re the returns of just the hedges that Universa uses. Only a small portion of Universa’s assets under management goes into the hedges. Most of the money goes for low-risk investments. Almost all of their hedges expire worthlessly. Universa then sells some of the remaining assets to buy new hedges. (CALPERS sold much of their Universa shortly before the crash because they couldn’t stomach the nearly continual small losses. They probably cancelled their fire insurance policies too.) The actual returns on AUM are closer to 200–300%. More detail at Tail-risk funds: When a 4000% hedge fund return is a mirage - ValueWalk.

  - Measures of well-being have often been found to rise with log (income). Kahneman and Deaton [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 16489–93 (2010)] reported an exception; a measure of emotional well-being (happiness) increased but then flattened somewhere between $60,000 and $90,000. In contrast, Killingsworth [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2016976118 (2021)] observed a linear relation between happiness and log(income) in an experience-sampling study. We discovered in a joint reanalysis of the experience sampling data that the flattening pattern exists but is restricted to the least happy 20% of the population, and that complementary nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log relationship between happiness and income. We trace the discrepant results to the authors’ reliance on standard practices and assumptions of data analysis that should be questioned more often, although they are standard in social science.
