In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands TCP sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.

  - (1) Instead of directly embedding code, we parse the AST of the codebase, recursively generate docstrings for each node in the tree, and then embed the docstrings. (2) Alongside vector similarity search and keyword search, we do ‚Äúagentic search‚Äù where an agent reviews the relevance of the search results, and scans the source code to follow references that might lead to something important. Then it returns the relevant sources.
