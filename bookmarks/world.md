## Nice places to visit (maybe)

  * Someone mentioned the #15 ride up to the Peak ... another good bus loop for thrills/ scenery is to take the #14 from Sai Wan Ho out to Stanley and then the #6 back to Central (or vice versa).
  * Take a picnic out to Kadoorie Farm, the Wetland Park, or one of the big urban parks, whether it's Tin Shui Wai, Hong Kong, or any of the ones in between.
  * Take in the view from the roof of the Kai Tak cruise terminal (another park!).
