# Curious Coincidences

It must have been a coincidence.

## 忌廉

有一日同蝶主席食雲吞麵。佢同伙記講要罐雪碧。伙記拎咗罐忌廉嚟。

我見狀就出聲話：咦唔係喎，佢叫咗雪碧。

蝶主席即刻修正：唔係，其實我係要忌廉。

我：你頭先唔係嗌雪碧咩？

蝶：我係嗌咗雪碧，但其實我係想叫忌廉。所以嚟咗忌廉就啱喇！

我：⋯⋯⋯

(唔排除兩者倒轉，我唔記得exact7ly係邊個打邊個)

"Tonight at Thula Thula, the whole herd arrived at the main house, home to Lawrence and I. We had not seen them here for a very long time. Extraordinary proof of animal sensitivity and awareness that only a few humans can perceive. And Lawrence was one of them. Thank you for your wonderful messages. Lawrence's legacy will be with us forever at Thula Thula."

Note that the family is Christian, and his father is a priest. Apparently a lot of MIRROR fans prayed for his recovery.
