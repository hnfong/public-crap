# Curious Coincidences

It must have been a coincidence.

## 忌廉

有一日同蝶主席食雲吞麵。佢同伙記講要罐雪碧。伙記拎咗罐忌廉嚟。

我見狀就出聲話：咦唔係喎，佢叫咗雪碧。

蝶主席即刻修正：唔係，其實我係要忌廉。

我：你頭先唔係嗌雪碧咩？

蝶：我係嗌咗雪碧，但其實我係想叫忌廉。所以嚟咗忌廉就啱喇！

我：⋯⋯⋯

(唔排除兩者倒轉，我唔記得exact7ly係邊個打邊個)

"Tonight at Thula Thula, the whole herd arrived at the main house, home to Lawrence and I. We had not seen them here for a very long time. Extraordinary proof of animal sensitivity and awareness that only a few humans can perceive. And Lawrence was one of them. Thank you for your wonderful messages. Lawrence's legacy will be with us forever at Thula Thula."
