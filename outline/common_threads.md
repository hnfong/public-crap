# Common Threads

## Death

- Death in all forms increases the chances of spiritual awakening
  - NDEs (not sure whether they should be considered resurrection cases actually)
  - Psychedelics
  - Ego death, 無我 practices
    - Meditation
    - "Zone"

## Internal Consistency

- 知行合一 is not a nicety to others, but rather a way to align internal forces

## Daily Practices

- Vegetarian lifestyle is not merely a matter of compassion for other animals (although it is), but apparently meat and heavy spices makes one feel more "heavy" in some way.
- Abstinence is not a masochistic way to live one's life, but rather, it is a conscious preference for those embarking on the spiritual path.
- Local food is apparently quite important. I suspect microbes carry more information than we are aware of.

## Spirits

- Intelligence is at most a couple hundred lines of C code (GPT), lots of simple computation units, gradients, and lots of data. Does not require "life" and does not require "reproduction".

## Philosophy

- Knowledge is just a belief in the Truth. Truth is subjective. The belief does not have to be justified.
- Objective Truth is justified belief.
