## 倉頡 vs Thoth

- Wikipedia: `The Egyptian pronunciation of ḏḥwty is not fully known, but may be reconstructed as *ḏiḥautī, perhaps pronounced *[t͡ʃʼi.ˈħau.tʰiː] or *[ci.ˈħau.tʰiː]. This reconstruction is based on the Ancient Greek borrowing Thōth ([tʰɔːtʰ]) or Theut and the fact that the name was transliterated into Sahidic Coptic variously as ⲑⲟⲟⲩⲧ Thoout, ⲑⲱⲑ Thōth, ⲑⲟⲟⲧ Thoot, ⲑⲁⲩⲧ Thaut, Taautos (Τααυτος), Thoor (Θωωρ), as well as Bohairic Coptic ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ Thōout. These spellings reflect known sound changes from earlier Egyptian such as the loss of ḏ palatalization and merger of ḥ with h i.e. initial ḏḥ > th > tʰ.[8] The loss of pre-Coptic final y/j is also common.[9] Following Egyptological convention, which eschews vowel reconstruction, the consonant skeleton ḏḥwty would be rendered "Djehuti" and the god is sometimes found under this name. However, the Greek form "Thoth" is more common.`
- https://academic-accelerator.com/encyclopedia/thoth `The Egyptian pronunciation of ḏḥwty is not completely known, but it has been reconstructed as *ḏiḥautī, possibly pronounced *[t͡ʃʼi.ˈħau.tʰiː] or *[ci.ˈħau.tʰiː] . This rebuilding is translated in various ways, such as the borrowing of the ancient Greek tote ([tʰɔːtʰ]) or theut, and the name of the Saahidan Copto, ⲑⲟⲟⲩⲧ Thout, ⲑⲱⲑ Thout, ⲑⲟⲟⲧ THAUT, TAAUTOS. It is based on the fact that (Τααυτος), Thor (Θωωρ) ), and Bohair Coptic ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ Thouout. These spellings reflect known sound changes from early Egyptian, such as the loss of ḏpalatalization and the fusion of ḥ and hi, the initials ḏḥ > th > tʰ. The final pre-Coptic y/j is often lost. Following the practice of Egyptology, which avoids vowel restructuring, the consonantal skeleton ḏḥwty is translated as "Jefti," and God is sometimes seen by this name. However, the Greek form "Thoth" is more common. According to Theodor Hopfner, the Egyptian name for Thoth, written ḏḥwty, is derived from ḏḥw, and is claimed to be the oldest known name for an ibis, and is usually written as hbj. has been written. Adding -ty indicates that it has the Ibis attribute. According to this interpretation, therefore, the name Thoth means "one who is like an ibis." Other forms of the name ḏḥwty using older transcriptions include Jehuti, Jehuty, Tahuti, Tehuti, Zehuti, Techu, or Tetu. As well as the title of Pharaoh, several titles of Thoth are also known, including A, Sheps, Lord of Khemennu, Asten, Khenti, Mehi, Hab, and A'an. Additionally, Thoth is also known for certain aspects of himself. For example, the moon god Ia Djehuti (j3ḥ-ḏḥw.ty), who represents the entire moon. The Greeks associated Thoth with their god Hermes due to its similar attributes and functions. One of Thoth's titles, ``Three Great Men,'' was translated into Greek τρισμέγιστος (Trismegistos), becoming Hermes Trismegistus.`

- 《康熙字典》：【唐韻】【正韻】胡結切【集韻】【韻會】奚結切，音纈。
- 《說文》：倉頡之初作書，蓋依類象形，故謂之文。其後形聲相益，即謂之字。文者，物象之本；字者，言孳乳而寖多也。著於竹帛謂之書。書者，如也。以迄五帝三王之世，改易殊體，封於泰山者七十有二代，靡有同焉。
- 《說文》：黃帝史官倉頡，見鳥獸蹄迒之跡，知分理之可相別異也

啲音勉強可能係有啲似，尤其係 /cʼVˈħawtij/ 呢啲 interpretation。

## 子 (甲骨文) ~ Ankh?

- 子字嘅甲骨文同 Ankh 好似極似。意思都似乎可以借得到嚟用。
- 孔字嘅說文解釋更加有趣，睇完之後唔知算係明定唔明：

```
清代陈昌治刻本【说文解字】孔
【卷十二】【乚部】孔

通也。从乚从子。乚，請子之候鳥也。乚至而得子，嘉美之也。古人名嘉字子孔。康董切

孔说文解字白话版
用“乙、子”会义。乙，是祈得子女、随季节而迁徙的鸟。乙鸟到，祈求者就会得到子女，使生活嘉美。据说古人有叫“嘉” 的，字 就取“子孔”。

清代段玉裁【說文解字注】
通也。通者達也。於易卦爲泰。孔訓通，故俗作空穴字多作孔。其實空者，竅也。作孔爲叚借。嘉美之也。各本無此四字。由淺人謂與下複而刪之。今依韵會補。也當作䛐。䛐者，意內而外也。通爲吉。？爲凶。故凡言孔者，皆所以嘉美之。毛傳曰。孔，甚也。是其義。甚者，尤安樂也。或曰。詩言亦孔之醜。豈嘉美之乎。曰。此卽今甚字通於美惡之意也。从𠃉子。會意。康董切。按此字未見三代用韵之文。但以肉好卽邊孔求之疑孔古音在三部。故吼犼芤以爲聲。𠃉請子之𠊱鳥也。月令。仲春。玄鳥至。至之日以大牢祠于高禖。天子親往。注云。高辛氏之世。玄鳥遺卵。娀𥳑吞之而生契。後王以爲媒官嘉祥。而立其祠焉。𠃉至而得子。嘉美之也。說从𠃉子會意之恉。故古人名嘉字子孔。此又以古人名字相應說孔訓嘉美之證。見於左傳者。楚成嘉字子孔。鄭公子嘉字子孔。春秋經宋孔父，左傳云孔父嘉。何休云經稱字。按孔父，字孔。故後以爲氏。
```

- 點解乚係玄鳥？
  - 漢朝已有「孔雀」呢樣嘢。至於點解咁叫真係唔 get。但可能佢係解緊「孔」＝「孔雀」。咁「乚」就係條尾。

- 點解名嘉字子孔？？？
  - 嘉=生仔 ( https://kknews.cc/history/rj23kpv.html )
  - 子孔=生仔 (乚，請子之候鳥也)

## Writing process

### Tolkien's Letters 66.
A new character has come on the scene (I am sure I did not invent him, I did not even want him, though I like him, but there he came walking into the woods of Ithilien): Faramir, the brother of Boromir – and he is holding up the 'catastrophe' by a lot of stuff about the history of Gondor and Rohan ...

### Tolkien's Letters 180.

I have long ceased to invent (though even patronizing or sneering critics on the side praise my 'invention'): I wait till I seem to know what really happened. Or till it writes itself. Thus, though I knew for years that Frodo would run into a tree-adventure somewhere far down the Great River, I have no recollection of inventing Ents. I came at last to the point, and wrote the 'Treebeard' chapter without any recollection of any previous thought: just as it now is. And then I saw that, of course, it had not happened to Frodo at all.

## Ursula K. Le Guin (https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/118nahw/tolkiens_writing_process/)

Ursula K. Le Guin experienced much the same writing process when writing the Earthsea-series. Here are some remarks from her:

“I didn’t plan anything, I found it. (...) In my subconscious.” (Le Guin 1975, Dreams Must Explain Themselves, p. 6)

“I did not deliberately invent Earthsea. I did not think ‘Hey wow - islands are archetypes and archipelagos are super-archetypes and let’s build us an archipelago.’ I am not an engineer, but an explorer. I discovered Earthsea.” (Le Guin 1975, Dreams Must Explain Themselves, p. 7)

“I did not deliberately invent Earthsea. I did not think ‘Hey wow - islands are archetypes and archipelagos are super-archetypes and let’s build us an archipelago.’ I am not an engineer, but an explorer. I discovered Earthsea.” (Le Guin 1975, Dreams Must Explain Themselves, p. 7)

“I don’t feel so much as if I was making it up. I know I am. But that isn’t what it feels like. It feels like being there. And looking around and listening.” (Curry 2018, The World of Ursula K Le Guin (documentary))
