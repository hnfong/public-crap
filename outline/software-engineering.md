- You don’t write the code for the machines, you write it for your colleagues and your future self. Write it for the junior ones as a reference. (Copied from https://alexewerlof.medium.com/my-guiding-principles-after-20-years-of-programming-a087dc55596c )
- Stay clear from hype-driven development. But learn all you can. Always have pet projects. (Copied from https://alexewerlof.medium.com/my-guiding-principles-after-20-years-of-programming-a087dc55596c )
  - also: Always be on the lookout for hype. Assume newly popular tech is hype until you've personally confirmed otherwise.
- Don’t solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Don’t do speculative programming. (Copied from https://alexewerlof.medium.com/my-guiding-principles-after-20-years-of-programming-a087dc55596c )
- K.I.S.S.
- When (and how) to import dependencies is one of the most important decisions of a software architect. The decision usually cannot be undone, so invest the time to evaluate options, and consider carefully whether the benefit is greater than the cost.
