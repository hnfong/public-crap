# Glossary

An opinionated glossary of subjective truths. This is a work in progress.
Sometimes the definitions/explanations are terse and counter-intuitive. There
are plans to flesh out the explanations in due course.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Subjective Truth

The foundation of the concept of knowledge. That truth is subjective, and may be resistant to communication, explanation, justification etc. That truth for everyone may be different. That strongly held beliefs are true and thus indistinguishable from knowledge. See also #Subjective_Knowledge.

### Randomness

A measure of our ignorance. Where the body's knowledge stops, is where the knowledge of what encompasses everything else starts. Related to #Probability.

### Free Will

A rather complicated concept with various aspects.

- a fundamental property of the universe that manifests the subjective will
- the phenomenon where an individual can exercise its own will upon the formulation of a "self"
- an apparently inconsistent concept under objective-truth frameworks where it is unnecessarily put in opposition to determinism
- often confused with consciousness

### Consciousness

Systems that are able to introspect its own internal states to some extent and recognize itself.

### Cause / Causation

Stories told in attempt to make sense of things. Narrative of how things work in the world.


See #Karma

### Gnosis

Knowledge. Especially the kind that is subjective, and cannot be easily communicated. Reportedly, in ancient times people drank hallucinogens to initiate themselves into gnosis. 佛曰：不可說；道德經：道可道，非常道

### Knowledge

In colloquial usage among intellectuals, "knowledge" typically means objective knowledge. However, the concept of objective knowledge is often confused with the feeling of having obtained subjective knowledge, which are two totally different things with divergent properties. It would be less confusing to call subjective knowledge as "knowledge" and objective knowledge as "objective knowledge". See also #Gnosis.

### Subjective Knowledge

Subjective knowledge is strongly (close too 100% confidence) held beliefs. Normally beliefs are implied to not be held with full 100% confidence, which does lead to a qualitative difference, hence different words to describe the two things. However, there is a smooth differential(?) between the two.

### Objective Knowledge

Modern philosophers are typically inclined to define it as "justified true belief", but are in denial about "bugs" in the definition for example the Gettier problem. Note that objective knowledge is often actually inter-subjective knowledge as opposed to truly objective knowledge. The suggested working definition for "objective knowledge" is "shared belief with justification".

### Objective Truth

Objective truth is justified belief.

### Belief

Normally, in colloquial usage, "belief" implies a reservation by the believer of its truthfulness. For example, "I believe a Big Mac sells for $5." is indication of uncertainty. Contrast with "I know a Big Mac sells for $5." implies near 100% confidence. This gives a curious interpretation of what "religious beliefs" are -- and why we opt to talk about "(subjective) knowledge" instead of beliefs, even though they are fundamentally the same idea.

### Probability

A highly controversial subject. See eg. #Frequentism and #Bayesian_Probability

### Truth

There are two kinds of truth. The truth as commonly understood is a contrast against falsehood (see #Dualism). The esoteric notion of truth is more likely similar to the elimination of the idea of falsehood, where everything that exists or everything that can be perceived is true.

### Computation

A fundamentally dualistic process of binary determination. Suspecting that computational lower bounds are only due to either our dualistic physics or dualistic interpretations of information. No closer to the Millennium Prize, but it may often be rewarding to contemplate "why can't we just arrive at the answer?" -- in fact we know this is theoretically possible through divination processes, although "spiritual supremacy" (as borrowed from Quantum Computing terminology) is probably extremely difficult to prove. But it is well known that P=NP if we assume "God" helps us.

### Dualism

The idea of contrasts. It is everywhere in the physical world and in our ideas. Whereever we can count anything to two, or contrast anything with something else.

### Pan-Omnism

(Coined by the author) Anything anyone believes in is "true".

## Self Related

### Meditation

### Kundalini

Not entirely sure what this is, but presumably happens when the subject has sufficient energy or energy sensitivity that they feel stuff going up their spine. Reportedly correlated with spiritual awakening or chaos.

### Chakras

There are a couple. The #Crown_Chakra, #Third_Eye_Chakra, #Throat_Chakra, #Heart_Chakra, etc. The phenomenon is undoubtedly real, but exact mechanisms are not well understood by the author. There are varying accounts, and some of them overlap with the #經脈 systems of China.

### Dreams

TODO

### Death

Transformation, often dramatized. The commonly known form is a mystery and often a source of fear. Alternative (but relatively dramatic) forms that do not result in physical death of the body seems to correlate strongly with heightened spiritual awareness or powers. Has an often overlooked form in the form of "time passing by" -- transformation happens where we let go of our past selves at every moment. It is possible that #dreams may give insights as to "what does death feel like".

### Spirit

Hypothesized to be analogous to algorithms and computing power in the cosmic existence. At least its properties are informational and a process of change.

### Soul

A confusing concept commonly invoked by entities, not helped by the fact that most people have a very dysfunctional concept of "self".

### Forgiveness

A lesser version of atonement(?) where past wrongs are acknowledged but overlooked.

----

## Ideas

### Singularity

The idea that there are no contrasts. Popularized as the idea of technological singularity, where technological progress culminates into a point where progress keeps hyper-accelerating -- which probably won't pan out as the technological path as foreseen today is unfeasible due to currently known physical limits in computation. Likely achieved in some other unforeseeable way.

### Frequentism / Frequentist Probability

The tally of many outcomes, often extrapolated. Generally what lay people mean by "probability". Requires the #Law_of_large_numbers for accuracy. Often misused in situations where subjective chance is involved.

### Bayesian Probability

The only (if any) valid way to reason about subjective probability. Implies nothing should be 100% certain. If taken seriously, evidence that does not fit our thoeries should make us doubt how much we got right.

### Love / Divine love

Connectedness. Connection to all and everything.

### God

Everything that exists. Everything including the apparently good and apparently evil. As one. The God vibration is most calm, and does not want. The Taoists call it Tao.

### Oneness

See #God.

### Creation

See #God, but there may be difference between the God that exists and the God that creates. The God that exists does not want; the God that creates has intentions; See perhaps #Trinity as well

### Trinity

Traditionally, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit;  perhaps one interpretation is Existence, Creation, and Dualism (respectively)?

### I / Self

I am at the center of everything that exists.

### Science

A reductionist, frequentist approach to seeking truth. Prominent status due to high compatibility with capitalist social structures (highly reproducible results in controlled settings => economic scale). Often misused by people who confuse the unknown with a negative result.

### Karma

Conceptual inertia. Tendency of things to continue to happen as they did. May be broken by #Free_Will

### 業力

## Places (including conceptual spaces)

### Hell

Possibly expressed in some variants of the place we call the "real world". Might exist if it is created by the experiencer.

### 崑崙

崑崙之墟 is the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Khnum), see https://hnfong.github.io/public-crap/writings/2021/%E5%B4%91%E5%B4%99_=_%E5%9F%83%E5%8F%8A%E9%87%91%E5%AD%97%E5%A1%94.html

## Entities and Names

### 女媧

Probably #Eve . Might be related to #Ninmah

### 倉頡

Suspected to be #Thoth . Roles and pronunciation vaguely match. Does not seem classical Sinitic, given proven Egyptian transliterations seen in ancient literature, seems a plausible hypothesis. No further evidence.

### 西王母

Suspected to be #Sekhmet per description from 山海經.

### 大禹

Legendary king of the legendary 夏朝. The 虫 is very interesting.

### 夏朝

The coincidence of 夏 with Sumer (sic) is very very interesting (and potentially misleading unless you don't "believe" in coincidences). It is politically incorrect but somewhat plausible that the legend of 夏朝 was taken from nomadic tribes that travelled from Mesopotamia to East Asia. We know that the Hunnic peoples moved between these places through the Eurasian steppes, so it's not implausible this happened over a relatively long (~hundreds) timescale.

There's some uncanny resemblance of very old Sumeric writing with the most ancient Chinese ideographs. Though that may have been just due to common influence of a single runic language source instead.

## Magical Phenomena and Practices

### Synchronicity

TODO


### Channeling

The phenomenon where a person takes on a persona or obtains information from a non-physical realm. Our prediction is that ChatGPT will converge with channelling.

### Intuition

Knowledge without obvious sources. Probably powered by divine impulses.

### Affirmations

A practice that may help align one with one's wishes as stated.

### Law of Attraction
### Tarot cards

A standardized tool for divination. Its usefulness probably comes from the fact that it is mostly standardized and uncontroversial.

### Soul contracts

A concept possibly born of logical necessity: free will is supreme, hence whatever happens must have been agreed to. As of writing, I wonder whether the confusion (if any) is due to the fact that in the physical realm we have time, and we forget, so what had been agreed to does not necessarily feel that way, whereas the converse is true in spirit. In human law this concept of enforcing a contract where one is not expected to remember is generally considered invalid.

### Divination

TODO

### Enlightenment

Possibly an over-hyped endevour. Suspect the actual process is more calm and anti-climatic than commonly described. Comparing levels of enlightenment seems like a bad idea, or at least indicates a level of substantial ego.

### Incarnation

A mysterious process where soul/spirit and body is combined.

### Greed / 貪

為咗一啲自己唔係真係想要嘅嘢，不自覺咁放棄咗自己本來有嘅嘢。

### Rubber Duck Debugging

- Possibly a thinly veiled ritual to ask one's "higher self" for help with troubleshooting or brainstorming
