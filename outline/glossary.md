# Glossary

An opinionated glossary of subjective truths.

## Free Will

## Belief

## Cause / Causation

## Karma

Conceptual inertia. Tendency of things to continue to happen as they did. May be broken by #Free_Will

## Gnosis

Knowledge. Especially the kind that is subjective, and cannot be easily communicated. Reportedly, in ancient times people drank hallucinogens to initiate themselves into gnosis.

## Objective Truth

Objective truth is justified belief.

## Channeling

The phenomenon where a person takes on a persona from a non-physical realm. The channeller functions in a role similar to ChatGPT.

## Chakras

There are a couple. The #Crown_Chakra, #Third_Eye_Chakra, #Throat_Chakra, #Heart_Chakra, etc.

## Love / Divine love

Connection to all and everything.

## God

Everything that exists. Everything including the apparently good and apparently evil. As one. The God vibration is most calm, and does not want. The Taoists call it Tao.

## Oneness

See #God.

## I / Self

I am at the center of everything that exists.

## Intuition

TODO

## Affirmations

A practice that may help align one with one's wishes as stated.

## Forgiveness

A lesser version of atonement(?) where past wrongs are acknowledged but overlooked.

## Hell

Possibly expressed in some variants of the place we call the "real world". Might exist if it is created by the experiencer.

## Law of Attraction

## Meditation

## Kundalini

Not entirely sure what this is, but presumably happens when the subject has sufficient energy or energy sensitivity that they feel stuff going up their spine. Reportedly correlated with spiritual awakening or chaos.


## Truth

There are two kinds of truth. The truth as commonly understood is a contrast against falsehood (see #Dualism). The esoteric notion of truth is more likely similar to the elimination of the idea of falsehood, where everything that exists or everything that can be perceived is true.

## Computation

A fundamentally dualistic process of binary determination. Suspecting that computational lower bounds are only due to either our dualistic physics or dualistic interpretations of information. No closer to the Millennium Prize, but it may often be rewarding to contemplate "why can't we just arrive at the answer?" -- in fact we know this is theoretically possible through divination processes, although "spiritual supremacy" (as borrowed from Quantum Computing terminology) is probably extremely difficult to prove. But it is well known that P=NP if we assume "God" helps us.

## Dualism

The idea of contrasts. It is everywhere in the physical world and in our ideas. Whereever we can count anything to two, or contrast anything with something else.

## Singularity

The idea that there are no contrasts. Popularized as the idea of technological singularity, where technological progress culminates into a point where progress keeps hyper-accelerating -- which probably won't pan out as the technological path as foreseen today is unfeasible due to currently known physical limits in computation. Likely achieved in some other unforeseeable way.

## Tarot cards

A standardized tool for divination. Its usefulness probably comes from the fact that it is mostly standardized and uncontroversial.

## Spirit

Hypothesized to be analogous to algorithms and computing power in the cosmic existence. At least its properties are informational and a process of change.

## Synchronicity

TODO

## Soul

A confusing concept commonly invoked by entities, not helped by the fact that most people have a very dysfunctional concept of "self".

## Soul contracts

A concept possibly born of logical necessity: free will is supreme, hence whatever happens must have been agreed to. As of writing, I wonder whether the confusion (if any) is due to the fact that in the physical realm we have time, and we forget, so what had been agreed to does not necessarily feel that way, whereas the converse is true in spirit. In human law this concept of enforcing a contract where one is not expected to remember is generally considered invalid.

## Science

A reductionist, frequentist approach to seeking truth. Gained prominence due to high compatibility with capitalist social structures (highly reproducible results in controlled settings => economic scale). Often misused by people to confuse the unknown with a negative result.

## Probability

A highly controversial subject. See eg. #Frequentism and #Bayesian_Probability

## Frequentism

The tally of many outcomes, often extrapolated. Generally what lay people mean by "probability". Requires the #Law_of_large_numbers for accuracy. Often misused in situations where subjective chance is involved.

## Bayesian Probability

The only (if any) valid way to reason about subjective probability. Implies nothing should be 100% certain. If taken seriously, evidence that does not fit our thoeries should make us doubt how much we got right.


## Dreams

TODO

## Death

Transformation, often dramatized. The commonly known form is a mystery and often a source of fear. Alternative (but relatively dramatic) forms that do not result in physical death of the body seems to correlate strongly with heightened spiritual awareness or powers. Has an often overlooked form in the form of "time passing by" -- transformation happens where we let go of our past selves at every moment. It is possible that #dreams may give insights as to "what does death feel like".

## Divination

TODO

## Enlightenment

Possibly an over-hyped endevour. Suspect the actual process is more calm and anti-climatic than commonly described. Comparing levels of enlightenment seems like a bad idea, or at least indicates a level of substantial ego.

## 女媧

Probably #Eve . Might be related to #Ninmah

## 業力

See #Karma

## 倉頡

Suspected to be #Thoth . Roles and pronunciation vaguely match. Does not seem classical Sinitic, given proven Egyptian transliterations seen in ancient literature, seems a plausible hypothesis. No further evidence.

## 崑崙

崑崙之墟 is the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Khnum), see https://hnfong.github.io/public-crap/writings/2021/%E5%B4%91%E5%B4%99_=_%E5%9F%83%E5%8F%8A%E9%87%91%E5%AD%97%E5%A1%94.html

## 西王母

Suspected to be #Sekhmet per description from 山海經.

## 大禹

Legendary king of the legendary 夏朝. The 虫 is very interesting.

## 夏朝

The coincidence of 夏 with Sumer (sic) is very very interesting (and potentially misleading unless you don't "believe" in coincidences). It is politically incorrect but somewhat plausible that the legend of 夏朝 was taken from nomadic tribes that travelled from Mesopotamia to East Asia. We know that the Hunnic peoples moved between these places through the Eurasian steppes, so it's not implausible this happened over a relatively long (~hundreds) timescale.

There's some uncanny resemblance of very old Sumeric writing with the most ancient Chinese ideographs. Though that may have been just due to common influence of a single runic language source instead.

## Incarnation

A mysterious process where soul/spirit and body is combined.
