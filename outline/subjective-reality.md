# Basic Laws and principles of subjective realities

- The purely subjective view is a valid perspective (self-evident, axiomatic)
- The purely objective (or inter-subjective) perspective, if it conflicts with the subjective view, can only be considered a social construct as opposed to a basis for fundamental truth
- Subjective reality implies that one's honest belief can affect the probability of something happening (proof: https://github.com/hnfong/public-crap/blob/main/writings/2022/09-Subjective_Truth.md )

# Observations

- From empirical observation, the world is definitely not purely subjective. Our honest beliefs are often challenged by facts to the contrary. The universe behaves mostly as most people expect it to. It does not always yield to any individual's outlier beliefs.
- Hence, intersubjective truth (or belief of combined individuals) likely contributes to the probabilities of events in addition to subjective truth
- Hence, even a strongly held belief may not have a high probability of being true if most other people believe the contrary

# Speculative applications

- The monastic lifestyle, the solitude of mystics in various cultures, can have the effect of increasing one's supernatural powers by disconnecting one from the social collective, hence increasing the influence of the subjective reality and diminishing the influence of inter-subjective reality; this can explain why many mystics have to train themselves by being totally alone in the wilderness (See eg. Luke 4:1-2)
- Placebo effect can be explained by subjective reality having a physical effect on one's own bodies (of course, it may be the case that other people believing a pill can help will also help in actuality)
- From the subjective perspective, the lack of knowledge can be a powerful tool if it opens up more possibilities for discovering a world that we prefer (alternatively stated, it is easier to believe something than to first disbelieve an existing "fact" before believing in something else)
  - Note that lack of knowledge can be considered a form of randomness
- To see the power of illogical systems, we must examine the properties of logical systems first.
  - Logical systems can be objectively (or at least inter-subjectively) deduced, are generally (self)consistent
  - Thus, results are already fixed and readily reproducible.
  - For illogical systems, nobody knows how things actually work (mechanically speaking down to the finest detail), the results are not reproducible, and they are often not self-consistent, where processes following different paths may end up in totally different results/conclusions.
  - These properties can be powerful from the perspective of subjective reality, since the lack of objective mechanism here ensures that the results are inherently probabilistic(?) and thus subjective reality has a higher power of influence in this sphere.
  - Where the subject believes they can proficiently work on that system, and are confident in their ability to do so, the aforementioned probabilities can be favorably influenced by subjective beliefs
  - As such, the illogical, inconsistent property of the system makes it possible for ultimately "correct" results to be produced with higher probability than would be expected.
  - However, note that any attempt to do a logical, rational meta-analysis on the effectiveness of such illogical systems is itself a logical process, and thus is flawed for the same reason that any other logical processes would not produce enhancement of subjective probabilities.
  - Systems and processes such as divination, non-scientific medicine or healing methods etc readily fit this description and can be a working hypothesis of how such things actually work.
