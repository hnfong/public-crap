  - 十幾年前去過都江堰，當時都冇人同我解釋到咁多嘢。

- 乾(曬過嘅)冬菇有好很多維他命D。比一般維他命丸嘅維D多成十倍以上。
  - eg. https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/place-mushrooms-in-sunlight-to-get-your-vitamin-d
  - 個人經歷，以前一到冬天就勁想瞓，平時少見太陽，有可能係太少D。近月keep住啪維D同魚肝油，情況好咗好多。按：最好都係見多啲太陽，太陽唔只係用嚟製D。

- 書： Famous Cases: Nine Trials that Changed the Law
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_High_Commission
  - 原來 trial by jury 係 trial by ordeal 俾人禁咗之後，英國法官發明嘅嘢嚟(?) - 要查可能查 Lateran Council 1215 同英國 1219 年廢除 Trial by Ordeal
  - 睇得出作者係冇咩包袱，啲評論好真心。例如 p17 "There was no question of a *presumption of innocence which was a concept still unknown*. And although, in modern times, jurors have long since ceased to be witnesses, and juries are made up of men and women of all classes, and in certain circumstances a majority verdict is permitted, the original concept of trial by jury remains with us" (emphasis mine)
    - 喺 Woolmington v Dpp 作者直接指出 "Faced with an authority that had been accepted for more than 170 years, namely Foster's book, Sankey tried to find on what authority Foster had stated his proposition of law. No earlier authority could be found for it and this provided the crack into which Sankey could put a wedge: Foster was writing not in his capacity of a distinguished judge but as a jurist."
    - 另外，中國 presumption of innocence 似乎最早可以追溯《史記．刑法志》：及孝文即位，躬脩玄默，勸趣農桑，減省租賦。而將相皆舊功臣，少文多質，懲惡亡秦之政，論議務在寬厚，恥言人之過失。化行天下，告訐之俗易。吏安其官，民樂其業，畜積歲增，戶口寖息。風流篤厚，禁罔疏闊。選張釋之為廷尉，**罪疑者予民**，是以刑罰大省，至於斷獄四百，有刑錯之風。
  - 啲 checks and balances 講得好透徹 （雖然得半頁紙）：
    - 提過 Bonham's Case (1610)
    - 另外作者自己評論："However, whilst the idea of a natural law principle of judicial appeal against statutes found no fertile ground in Britain it had an immense influence in the United States, leading to the review role of the Supreme Court which can and does overturn acts of Congress. Today in England statutes are supreme and can overrule the decisions of the courts. None the less, judges generally continue to consider that the common law is wider and more fundamental than statutes which they believe should be construed within its context."
  - 某程度有少少意猶未盡。可能寫返個香港版嘅都唔錯。
  - 兩位作者唔知乜水嚟(網絡冇咩蹤跡)，不過其中一個有個係 CBiol 同 PhD。


- 美國 Senate 通過議案永續 daylight saving. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-approves-bill-that-would-make-daylight-savings-time-permanent-2023-2022-03-15/
  - The bill was originated in the senate so it needs to pass house
  - Sponsor is Marco Rubio, republican. I wonder whether House is as enthusiastic passing the bill.
  - At any rate even if passed, the bill will take effect in nov 2023

- 忽然諗起：夏蟲不可語冰，小年不及大年。現代人缺乏歷史思維，一個項目等幾年都覺得太耐，回報唔夠快。加上人類歷史只回溯到幾千年，令到我哋冇咗長期計算嘅能力。中共講到自己長期計劃世界第一，咩「兩個一百年」，都只係一百年嘅玩意，甚至連秦始皇都不及。點樣擴展人類嘅歷史思維，係我哋呢代人有責任去做嘅嘢嚟。
