- Nature Wants Us to Be Fat THE SURPRISING SCIENCE BEHIND WHY WE GAIN WEIGHT AND HOW WE CAN PREVENT–AND REVERSE–IT By Richard Johnson
  - Very surprising indeed, it claims that:
    - Fructose makes us fat (known fact and uncontroversial)
    - The body converts glucose to fructose (apparently known fact, but when?)
    - Glucose makes us fat by being converted to fructose when blood sugars are high
    - **Dehydration induces fructose production** because the body wants to store fat as water source (think camels)
    - Salt triggers dehydration response and also makes you fat
    - Glutamate also triggers fructose production
  - author does not mention stress, but presumably animals probably want to store more fat under chronic stress too
  - interesting thing is that these factors seem to match what I observe personally with my body
  - Switch Diet:
    - reduce sugar
    - reduce high glycemic carbs
    - red meat (may have M?P) and shellfish (glutamates) sparingly
    - protein mainly fish, dairy, poultry and veggie proteins
    - fats monounsaturated fats or omega-3
    - limit saturated fats
    - plenty of water to avoid dehydration and triggering fructose switch
    - restrict salt intake
    - don't overeat umami foods
    - no beer, alcohol, if drink, drink slowly
    - diary ok
    - coffee good
    - green tea good (epigallocatechin)
    - dark chocolate good (or epicatechin supplement)
    - vitamin C helps by stimulating excretion of uric acid and blocking its effects
      - 500~1000mg
      - more -> kidney stone
  - intermittent fasting helps
  - exercise to improve mitochondria function:
    - "find an exercise intensity where you can last an hour without accumulating lactate"
    - "the right exercise intenstiy should allow you to maintain a conversation but with some degree of difficulty"
    - "walk fast, cycle or run such that you pass the simple conversation test and do this several times a week"
    - antioxidants like Vit C may also interferer with the rebuilding of mitochondria
    - exercise during morning is more effective (due to glycogen reserves more empty)
