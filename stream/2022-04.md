- Nature Wants Us to Be Fat THE SURPRISING SCIENCE BEHIND WHY WE GAIN WEIGHT AND HOW WE CAN PREVENT–AND REVERSE–IT By Richard Johnson
  - Very surprising indeed, it claims that:
    - Fructose makes us fat (known fact and uncontroversial)
    - The body converts glucose to fructose (apparently known fact, but when?)
    - Glucose makes us fat by being converted to fructose when blood sugars are high
    - **Dehydration induces fructose production** because the body wants to store fat as water source (think camels)
    - Salt triggers dehydration response and also makes you fat
    - Glutamate also triggers fructose production
  - author does not mention stress, but presumably animals probably want to store more fat under chronic stress too
  - interesting thing is that these factors seem to match what I observe personally with my body
  - Switch Diet:
    - reduce sugar
    - reduce high glycemic carbs
    - red meat (may have M?P) and shellfish (glutamates) sparingly
    - protein mainly fish, dairy, poultry and veggie proteins
    - fats monounsaturated fats or omega-3
    - limit saturated fats
    - plenty of water to avoid dehydration and triggering fructose switch
    - restrict salt intake
    - don't overeat umami foods
    - no beer, alcohol, if drink, drink slowly
    - diary ok
    - coffee good
    - green tea good (epigallocatechin)
    - dark chocolate good (or epicatechin supplement)
    - vitamin C helps by stimulating excretion of uric acid and blocking its effects
      - 500~1000mg
      - more -> kidney stone
  - intermittent fasting helps
  - exercise to improve mitochondria function:
    - "find an exercise intensity where you can last an hour without accumulating lactate"
    - "the right exercise intenstiy should allow you to maintain a conversation but with some degree of difficulty"
    - "walk fast, cycle or run such that you pass the simple conversation test and do this several times a week"
    - antioxidants like Vit C may also interferer with the rebuilding of mitochondria
    - exercise during morning is more effective (due to glycogen reserves more empty)

- The Sign and the Seal - A Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant (Graham Hancock)
  - Skimmed through the story. It was interesting.
  - author seemed to imply that the Ark of the Covenant was some nuclear reactor that utilized ancient lost technology from Egypt (Moses was in the Egyptian high priest inner circles and likely a magician).
  - which led me to wonder -- perhaps, at an age where knowledge was guarded more secretly, privileged groups knew much more than they admitted, but those knowledge never became publicized like today?
  - Why would magicians give out their secrets to everyone? Perhaps the industrial revolution of deploying bleeding edge technology to improve the masses *was* a even a greater innovation than we think. Perhaps elite groups in ancient civilizations knew more about science and technology than they would like people to know (and rumours still spread!) In retrospect, it seems obvious that most people would likely closely guard their secrets instead of deploying it to benefit the masses. It is only in the modern age that this somehow changed. Perhaps capitalist structure of society made profits too alluring for secrets to be kept to a small circle (since it would prevent mass exploitation of the tech). Perhaps wars between nations made mass deployment of technology a necessary condition for survival (of a nation).
